This has led some investigators to hypothesize that such illnesses may also have disruptive effects on sleep. While several self-report studies suggest that viral illness may influence sleep parameters, no studies have assessed polysomnographically recorded sleep following viral infections. Design: Parallel control group comparison. Setting: Sleep laboratory in a large urban medical center. Participants: Twenty-one men and women with susceptibility to the rhinovirus type 23. Interventions: Nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 23. Measurements: Polysomnographically recorded sleep for five nights (2300\u20130700 h) post-viral inoculation. Twice daily (1030 and 1430 h) performance assessment during each experimental day using auditory vigilance and divided attention tasks. A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed daily for the duration of the study. Results: In symptomatic individuals, total sleep time decreased an average of 23 min, consolidated sleep decreased an average of 36 min, and sleep efficiency was reduced by an average of 5% during the active viral period (experimental days/nights 3\u20135) compared with the incubation period. Psychomotor performance was impaired. These changes were significantly greater than those observed in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: The common cold can have detrimental effects on sleep and psychomotor performance in symptomatic individuals during the initial active phase of the illness.","publish_time":"2000-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drake, Christopher L; Roehrs, Timothy A; Royer, Heather; Koshorek, Gale; Turner, Ronald B; Roth, Thomas","journal":"Physiology \u0026 Behavior","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d7a11987b2cc4ccd5f9e73889adda2faf58e02e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134541.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003193840000322X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003193840000322X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recorded sleep","Sleep laboratory","sleep parameters","consolidated sleep","sleep efficiency","total sleep time","multiple sleep latency test","viral illness","Psychomotor performance","average","active viral period","psychomotor vigilance","viral infections","post-viral inoculation","performance assessment","asymptomatic individuals","rhinovirus type","nights","Polysomnographically","auditory vigilance","experimental days","common cold produces impairments","detrimental effects","disruptive effects","Nasal inoculation","incubation period","initial active phase","self-report studies","Abstract Study objectives","evidence","divided attention tasks","women","large urban medical center","Design","Parallel control group comparison","susceptibility","MSLT","Interventions","illnesses","Results","Setting","Participants","Conclusions","Measurements","investigators","changes","duration"],"language":"en"},

The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate. To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established standardised formats for classifying viruses. Under these rules, a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on phylogeny and taxonomy.4 Through DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses,5 the newly emerged coronavirus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to SARS-CoV, the primary viral isolate defining the species. The SARS-CoV species includes viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV_PC4-227, and SARSr-CoV-btKY72. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of this viral species. The use of SARS in naming SARS-CoV-2 does not derive from the name of the SARS disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species. The use of SARS for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species, SARS-CoV. In other words, viruses in this species can be named SARS regardless of whether or not they cause SARS-like diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yuntao; Ho, Wenzhe; Huang, Yaowei; Jin, Dong-Yan; Li, Shiyue; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liu, Xuefeng; Qiu, Jianming; Sang, Yongming; Wang, Qiuhong; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Zhi-Ming","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dde340deadeeaaef0533b4e5f15f8deff71510a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151324/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30557-2; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620305572; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305572","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shibo Jiang"],"organizations":["Coronavirus Study Group","International Committee","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS species","SARS-CoV species","use of SARS","SARS disease","naming SARS-CoV","adoption of SARS","SARS-related coronaviruses","SARSr-CoV","coronavirus disease","Taxonomy of Viruses","viral species","emerged coronavirus","emerged virus","human coronavirus","authors","Coronavirus Study Group","founding virus","sister virus","new virus","International Committee","designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","taxonomic practice","good practice","taxonomic relationship","primary viral isolate","hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses","DivErsity pArtitioning","scientific exchange","natural extension","low-pathogenic form","Correspondence","Shibo Jiang","standardised formats","newest member","PC4","probability of future attenuation","colleagues","phylogeny","HCoV","adverse effects","btKY72","rules","public","words","genome sequences","concerns","suggestions","addition","grounds","diseases"],"language":"en"},

Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare. HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction. Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).

Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of 10 viruses were performed. A total of 106 asthma attack patients enrolled in this study in both inpatient (n = 49) and outpatient (n = 57) settings. The total 106 respiratory samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal swab (n = 68) or sputum (n = 38). Among these, patients with virus alone (n = 39), virus and bacterial (n = 5), and bacterial alone (n = 5) were identified. The ratio of virus-positive patients in inpatient or outpatient to the total cases were 31.1% (n = 33) and 10.4% (n = 11), respectively. The frequency of virus-positive patients was significantly higher in inpatients (75.3%, n = 33) than in outpatients (19.3%, n = 11). Major VRIs included human rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 24), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (n = 9), influenza virus (Inf-V) (n = 8), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 3) infections with seasonal variations. HRV-A and HRV-C were the most commonly detected viruses, with wide genetic divergence on phylogenetic analysis. Asthmatic exacerbations in adults are highly associated with VRIs such as HRV-A or HRV-C, hMPV, RSV, and Inf-V infections with seasonal variations and genetic divergence, but similar frequencies of VRIs occurred in asthma attack patients throughout the seasons.","publish_time":"2017-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saraya, Takeshi; Kimura, Hirokazu; Kurai, Daisuke; Ishii, Haruyuki; Takizawa, Hajime","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfa781bcc4c907490ddfceebd374669983a98082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5662372.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000008204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kyorin University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma attack patients","positive patients","adult patients","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza virus","HRV-C","ratio of virus","frequency of virus","asthma attacks","exacerbation of asthma","Major VRIs","profiles of VRIs","respiratory samples","respiratory pathogens","Inf-V infections","similar frequencies of VRIs","phylogenetic analysis methods","significance of viral respiratory infections","RSV","seasonal variations","inpatients","outpatients","hMPV","total cases","wide genetic divergence","cross-sectional observational study","human rhinovirus","human metapneumovirus","detected viruses","conventional microbiological methods","RT-PCR","sequencing","Kyorin University Hospital","nasopharyngeal swab","adults","distance analyses","seasons","molecular epidemiology","Asthmatic exacerbations","reports","settings","sputum","aim"],"language":"en"},

Carriage of bacterial and viral species was shown to vary with participant age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. The spatial structure of microbial respiratory communities was less nested (more disordered) in the young (0-4 years) and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed for samples collected in the summer and from older individuals (those aged 5-17, 18-64 and \u226565 years) but not in samples collected from winter, younger individuals (those aged 0-4 years), individuals with recent RTI and individuals without recent RTI, demonstrating the importance of both neutral and niche processes in respiratory community assembly.

The virus was identified recently in Sweden, and has now been detected in several different countries. Although it is associated with lower respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients, the incidence of HBoV infection in a developed country in South East Asia, has not been examined. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of HBoV as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections among children admitted to hospital in Singapore. Five hundred nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from anonymized pediatric patients admitted to the Kandang Kerbau Women\u0027s and Children\u0027s Hospital for acute respiratory infections. The specimens were tested for the presence of HBoV using polymerase chain reactions. HBoV was detected in 8.0% of the patients tested, and a majority of these HBoV patients exhibited lower respiratory tract infections. A significant level of coinfection with respiratory syncytial viruses and rhinoviruses was also observed in these HBoV patients. The data suggest that HBoV is an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections among children admitted to hospital in Singapore, and is the first study examining the incidence of HBoV infection in a developed country in South East Asia.

On 30 September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed through laboratory testing the first Ebola virus infection diagnosed in the USA, in a patient who travelled from West Africa to Texas. On 6 October 2014, the first human infection occurring outside of Africa was reported, in a Spanish nurse who treated two priests, both of whom died, and on 23 October 2014, the first human infection was reported in New York City. To date, the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the longest, largest, and most persistent one since 1976, when the virus was first identified in humans, and the number of human cases exceeded, as of mid\u2010September 2014, the cumulative number of infections from all the previous outbreaks. The early clinical presentation overlaps with other infectious diseases, opening differential diagnosis difficulties. Understanding the transmission routes and identifying the natural reservoir of the virus are additional challenges in studying Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Ebola virus is as much a public health challenge for developing countries as it is for the developed world, and previous outbreaks underscored that the relative contribution of the risk factors may differ among outbreaks. The implementation of effective preparedness plans is contingent on integrating teachings from previous Ebola virus outbreaks with those from the current outbreak and with lessons provided by other infectious diseases, along with developing a multifaceted inter\u2010disciplinary and cross\u2010disciplinary framework that should be established and shaped by biomedical as well as sociopolitical sciences.","publish_time":"2014-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, R.

Within months, additional cases were described, mostly in frontline troops, and the new disease was called trench fever. More than 1 million troops were infected with trench fever during World War 1, with each affected soldier unfit for duty for more than 60 days. Diagnosis was challenging, because there were no pathognomonic signs and symptoms and the causative organism could not be cultured. For 3 years, the transmission and cause of trench fever were hotly debated. In 1918, two commissions identified that the disease was louse-borne. The bacterium Rickettsia quintana was consistently found in the gut and faeces of lice that had fed on patients with trench fever and its causative role was accepted in the 1920s. The organism was cultured in the 1960s and reclassified as Bartonella quintana; it was also found to cause endocarditis, peliosis hepatis, and bacillary angiomatosis. Subsequently, B quintana infection has been identified in new populations in the Andes, in homeless people in urban areas, and in individuals with HIV. The story of trench fever shows how war can lead to the recrudescence of an infectious disease and how medicine approached an emerging infection a century ago.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anstead, Gregory M","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f1fa39eb67f354bbe60bf6f0bc7f6f9c5e5895.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375211/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309916300032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309916300032; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(16)30003-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Western Front"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cause of trench fever","story of trench fever","relapsing fever","new disease","infectious disease","causative organism","B quintana infection","Bartonella quintana","bacterium Rickettsia quintana","new populations","World War","emerging infection","affected soldier","causative role","frontline troops","dizziness","urban areas","Andes","lumbago","medicine","headache","homeless people","peliosis hepatis","symptoms","transmission","patients","British medical officer","bacillary angiomatosis","pathognomonic signs","endocarditis","individuals","shin pain","duty","century","gut","recrudescence","additional cases","faeces of lice","months","Summary","HIV","years","commissions","louse","days","Diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

However, the exact mechanism by which PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 during infection of its natural host cells remains less well defined. Here, we show that PRRSV efficiently activates the transcription of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 in porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in a time-dependent and transient manner; and this effect is dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Despite the abundant IFN-\u03B1 transcripts detected in PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, little or no detectable IFN-\u03B1 is found in the supernatants and cell lysates of PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, suggesting that PRRSV either blocks the translation of IFN-\u03B1 or inhibits the RNA processing and transport. Furthermore, we observed that PRRSV infection significantly reduced the induction of IFN-\u03B1 by Poly I:C treatment; and virus replication is essential to the effect since heat-inactivated PRRSV has no effect on IFN-\u03B1 induction by Poly I:C. Overall, our data provide evidence for the possible role of PI3K in the activation of the transcription of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 by PRRSV. We conclude that PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-\u03B1 in Mo-DC by as yet undefined post-transcriptional mechanisms.","publish_time":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hanmo; Guo, Xueshui; Nelson, Eric; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Wang, Xiuqing","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/454b2ad75c7397bc5da7522ace90229d592f0707.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127654.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592217/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351200274X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351200274X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 induction","induction of IFN","detectable IFN-\u03B1","transcription of IFN","PRRSV infection","translation of IFN","abundant IFN-\u03B1 transcripts","PRRSV-infected Mo-DC","cell lysates of PRRSV","heat-inactivated PRRSV","effect","Poly","virus replication","time-dependent","activation of phosphatidylinositol","porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells","respiratory syndrome virus","natural host cells","possible role of PI3K","beta","C treatment","delayed development of adaptive immunity","poor inducer of interferon alpha","transient manner","resultant viral persistence","evidence","undefined post-transcriptional mechanisms","supernatants","RNA processing","data","kinase","exact mechanism","transport"],"language":"en"},

Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management. The only FDA approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir, and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon and colchicine. Purpose To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the illness and its proposed treatments. Methods In this targeted review we performed structured literature searches in PubMed to identify articles describing the impacts of COVID-19 on different organ systems, the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments, and any potential drug interactions with psychotropics. The articles most relevant to this manuscript were included. Results COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, and hematological systems. This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse effects. Additionally, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used psychotropics. Conclusion Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some COVID-19 patients. They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of medications being used to treat this disease. Further research is needed to identify strategies to manage psychiatric issues in this population.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bilbul, Melanie; Paparone, Patricia; Kim, Anna M.; Mutalik, Shruti; Ernst, Carrie L.","journal":"Psychosomatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61e9427085f209ebbca170b0cdbd378ec8c0d25b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318220301444?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425246/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318220301444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impacts of COVID","Results COVID","patients","neuropsychiatric effects of medications","psychotropic medications","proposed treatments","used psychotropics","neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments","psychotropic-related adverse effects","label medications","certain medications","existing psychotropics","different organ systems","impacts multiple organ systems","potential interactions","hematological systems","potential drug interactions","psychotropic management","articles","Conclusion Clinicians","FDA approved drug","major safety considerations relevant","vitamin C","ritonavir","favipiravir","azithromycin","convalescent plasma therapy","lopinavir","hydroxychloroquine","structured literature searches","sensitivity","global spread of SARS","targeted review","corticosteroids","tocilizumab","overview","PubMed","interferon","hospitals","need","Abstract Background","strategies","psychiatric issues","colchicine","pharmacokinetic changes","illness","Consultation-liaison psychiatrists","population","Methods","manuscript","remdesivir","virus","research","Purpose","disease"],"language":"en"},

This follows the pathological loss of myelin in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination can restore conduction properties to axons (thereby restoring neurological function) and is increasingly believed to exert a neuroprotective role on axons. Remyelination occurs in many MS lesions but becomes increasingly incomplete/inadequate and eventually fails in the majority of lesions and patients. Efforts to understand the causes for this failure of regeneration have fueled research into the biology of remyelination and the complex, interdependent cellular and molecular factors that regulate this process. Examination of the mechanisms of repair of experimental lesions has demonstrated that remyelination occurs in two major phases. The first consists of colonization of lesions by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the second the differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes that contact demyelinated axons to generate functional myelin sheaths. Several intracellular and extracellular molecules have been identified that mediate these two phases of repair. Theoretically, the repair of demyelinating lesions can be promoted by enhancing the intrinsic repair process (by providing one or more remyelination\u2010enhancing factors or via immunoglobulin therapy). Alternatively, endogenous repair can be bypassed by introducing myelinogenic cells into demyelinated areas; several cellular candidates have been identified that can mediate repair of experimental demyelinating lesions. Future challenges confronting therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination will involve the translation of findings from basic science to clinical demyelinating disease.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chari, Divya M.","journal":"International Review of Neurobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a364e414e723fbe3309c04a233c1f39f329639b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112255.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774207790268; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0074774207790268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["repair of demyelinating lesions","repair of experimental demyelinating lesions","biology of remyelination","experimental lesions","MS lesions","phases of repair","colonization of lesions","majority of lesions","mechanisms of repair","endogenous repair","demyelinated axons","intrinsic repair process","new myelin sheaths","functional myelin sheaths","pathological loss of myelin","clinical demyelinating disease","demyelinated areas","differentiation of OPCs","molecular factors","myelinogenic cells","cellular candidates","major phases","oligodendrocyte progenitor cells","basic science","diseases","complex","adult central nervous system","translation of findings","myelinating oligodendrocytes","multiple sclerosis","CNS","research","therapeutic strategies","phenomenon","failure of regeneration","Future challenges","conduction properties","causes","neurological function","immunoglobulin therapy","extracellular molecules","neuroprotective role","patients","Examination","Efforts"],"language":"en"},

Cell\u2010culture supernatants and clinical samples were used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity of the assay. The assay was used routinely during two winter epidemics for testing respiratory specimens from 2,417 patients. The limit of detection in cell\u2010culture supernatant was 1\u201310 plaque forming units/input (influenza A/B) and 2 \u00D7 10(\u22122) 50% tissue culture infectious dose/input (RSV).

During the winter 2008\u20132009, the assay identified 145 RSV, 42 influenza A, and one mixed RSV\u2010influenza A infections among 298 patients. The next winter, the assay was used in two independent hospital laboratory settings. 776 patients were tested in one hospital and 1,343 in the other, resulting in 184 and 501 RSV, 133 and 150 influenza A, and 1 and 11 mixed RSV\u2010influenza A infections, respectively, being detected.

How the transmission efficiency of an arbovirus (i.e. vector competence) varies with temperature influences not only the short term risk of arbovirus outbreaks in humans and livestock but also the long term impact of climate change on the geographical range of the virus. The strength of the interaction between viral surface (glyco)protein (GP) and the host cell receptor (Cr) on binding of virus to host cell is defined by the thermodynamic dissociation constant Kd_receptor which is assumed to equal 10\u22123 M (at 37 \u00B0C) for binding of a sialic acid (SA) on the arthropod midgut epithelial cell surface to a SA-binding site on the surface of BTV, for example. Here virus binding affinity is modelled with increasing number of GP/Cr contacts at temperatures from 10 \u00B0C to 35 \u00B0C taking into account the change in entropy on immobilization of the whole virus on binding (\u0394Sa_immob). Based on published data, three thermodynamic GP/Cr binding scenarios, namely enthalpy-driven, entropy-assisted and entropy-driven, are shown to affect the temperature sensitivity of virus binding in different ways. Thus for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding, viruses bind host cells much more strongly at 10 \u00B0C than 35 \u00B0C. A mechanistic model is developed for the number of arthropod midgut cells with bound virus and by building in a kinetic component for the rate of arbovirus replication and subsequent spread to the arthropod salivary glands, a model for the effect of temperature on vector competence is developed. The model separates the opposing effects of temperature on midgut cell binding affinity from the kinetic component of virogenesis. It successfully accommodates both increases in vector competence with temperature as for DENV and WNV in mosquitoes and decreases as for the CHIKV 2010\u20131909 strain in various populations of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Enhanced cell binding at lower temperatures through enthalpy-driven GP/Cr binding compensates for the lower replication rate to some degree such that some transmission can still occur at lower temperatures. In contrast, the strength of entropy-driven GP/Cr binding diminishes at low temperatures although there is no minimum temperature threshold for transmission efficiency. The magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob is an important data gap. It is concluded that thermodynamic and kinetic data obtained at the molecular level will prove important in modelling vector competence with temperature.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gale, Paul","journal":"Microbial Risk Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18d8439bcd41a4f23a1483ec993f00f736b0b597.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104215.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352218300367; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352352218300367; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2019.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of virus","virus binding affinity","temperature sensitivity of virus binding","Cr binding scenarios","Enhanced cell binding","midgut cell binding affinity","bluetongue virus","dengue virus","chikungunya virus","bound virus","SA-binding site","enthalpy-driven GP","thermodynamic GP","temperature influences","effect of temperature","ambient temperature","West Nile virus","lower temperatures","Cr contacts","host cell receptor","opposing effects of temperature","minimum temperature threshold","arthropod midgut epithelial cell surface","increasing number of GP","low temperatures","kinetic data","modelling vector competence","strength of entropy","number of arthropod midgut cells","range of average temperatures","surface of BTV","arthropod vectors","host cells","transmission efficiency","rate of arbovirus replication","lower replication rate","viral surface","arthropod salivary glands","DENV","WNV","kinetic component of virogenesis","important data gap","CHIKV","published data","mechanistic model","short term risk of arbovirus outbreaks","thermodynamic dissociation constant Kd","geographical range","magnitude of \u0394Sa","long term impact of climate change","various populations of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes","subsequent spread","livestock","humans","molecular level","strain","glyco","protein","immobilization","different ways","interaction","Abstract Arboviruses","account","degree","sialic acid","example","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus.

However, since the emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses may compromise the clinical utility of this class of anti-influenza agents, it is very important to develop new anti-influenza agents which target a different region in NA responsible for its sensitivity from that for NA inhibitors and could be used to treat NA inhibitors-resistant isolates. The oligodeoxynucleotide D35, multimerized and aggregated, suppressed replication of influenza A viruses except A/WSN/33 (WSN). The suppressive viral replication by D35 depended on G-terad and multimer formation. The range of the suppressive viral replication at the late stage, including virus assembly and release from infected cells, was much larger than that at the initial stage, viral attachment and entry. D35 suppressed NA activity of influenza A viruses. Furthermore, replacing the NA gene of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), in which viral replication was inhibited by D35 at the late stage, with the NA gene from WSN, in which viral replication was not inhibited, eliminated the D35-dependent suppression. D35 showed an additive anti-influenza effect with oseltamivir. It was also effective in vivo. These results suggest that the influenza virus NA mainly contributse to the D35-suppressible virus release from infected cells at the late stage. In addition, because administration of D35 into the virus-infected mice suppressed viral replication and weight loss, clinical application of D35 could be considered.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamada, Hiroshi; Nagase, Satoshi; Takahashi, Kazuo; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kida, Hiroshi; Okamoto, Shigefumi","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cab975494ad23b141d48ac5c47f77016d3589fcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113795.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216300894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923882/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.02.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216300894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus NA","NA activity of influenza","suppressed replication of influenza","NA gene","administration of D35","oligodeoxynucleotide D35","NA responsible","suppressive viral replication","D35-suppressible virus release","clinical application of D35","control of influenza virus infections","NA inhibitors-resistant isolates","D35-dependent suppression","class of anti-influenza agents","new anti-influenza agents","late stage","viral attachment","additive anti-influenza effect","emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses","virus-infected mice","virus assembly","WSN","infected cells","initial stage","clinical utility","important additional measures","effective drugs available","weight loss","different region","contributse","G-terad","neuraminidase","sensitivity","Puerto Rico","oseltamivir","entry","PR8","multimer formation","range","results"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to identify influenza-specific factors associated with ICU admission and mortality. Furthermore, influenza-specific pulmonary bacterial, fungal and viral co-infections were investigated. METHODS: 199 influenza patients, admitted to two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 01-10-2015 and 01-04-2016 were investigated of which 45/199 were admitted to the ICU. RESULTS: A history of Obstructive/Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, influenza type A, BMI \u003E 30, the development of renal failure and bacterial and fungal co-infections, were observed more frequently in patients who were admitted to the ICU, compared with patients at the normal ward. Co-infections were evident in 55.6% of ICU-admitted patients, compared with 20.1% of patients at the normal ward, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Non-survivors suffered from diabetes mellitus and (pre-existent) renal failure more often. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that a history of OSAS/CSAS, myocardial infarction and BMI \u003E 30 might be related to ICU admission in influenza patients.

They mature upon recognition of pathogens and upregulate MHC molecules and costimulatory receptors to activate antigen-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells. It is now well established that DCs are not a homogeneous population but are composed of different subsets with specialized functions in immune responses to specific pathogens. Upon viral infections, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) rapidly produce large amounts of IFN-\u03B1, which has potent antiviral functions and activates several other immune cells. However, pDCs are not particularly potent APCs and induce the tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 in CD4(\u002B) T cells. In contrast, myeloid DCs (mDCs) are very potent APCs and possess the unique capacity to prime naive T cells and consequently to initiate a primary adaptive immune response. Different subsets of mDCs with specialized functions have been identified. In mice, CD8\u03B1(\u002B) mDCs capture antigenic material from necrotic cells, secrete high levels of IL-12, and prime Th1 and cytotoxic T-cell responses to control intracellular pathogens. Conversely, CD8\u03B1(\u2212) mDCs preferentially prime CD4(\u002B) T cells and promote Th2 or Th17 differentiation. BDCA-3(\u002B) mDC2 are the human homologue of CD8\u03B1(\u002B) mDCs, since they share the expression of several key molecules, the capacity to cross-present antigens to CD8(\u002B) T-cells and to produce IFN-\u03BB. However, although several features of the DC network are conserved between humans and mice, the expression of several toll-like receptors as well as the production of cytokines that regulate T-cell differentiation are different. Intriguingly, recent data suggest specific roles for human DC subsets in immune responses against individual pathogens. The biology of human DC subsets holds the promise to be exploitable in translational medicine, in particular for the development of vaccines against persistent infections or cancer.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geginat, Jens; Nizzoli, Giulia; Paroni, Moira; Maglie, Stefano; Larghi, Paola; Pascolo, Steve; Abrignani, Sergio","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00142f93c18b07350be89e96372d240372437ed9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4603245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528289/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00527","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cells","immune cells","immune responses","prime naive T cells","necrotic cells","Dendritic cells","Different subsets of mDCs","T-cell differentiation","cytotoxic T-cell responses","immune system","specific pathogens","specialized functions","prime CD4","potent APCs","biology of human DC subsets","antigen-specific CD4","specialized antigen","primary adaptive immune response","individual pathogens","plasmacytoid DCs","intracellular pathogens","myeloid DCs","recognition of pathogens","potent antiviral functions","human homologue of CD8\u03B1","specific roles","prime Th1","DC network","key molecules","pDCs","expression","mice","unique capacity","MHC molecules","costimulatory receptors","persistent infections","viral infections","key role","adaptive arms","Th17 differentiation","IFN-\u03BB","tolerogenic cytokine IL","high levels of IL","large amounts of IFN","promise","development of vaccines","cross-present antigens","antigenic material","translational medicine","recent data","mDC2","humans","Th2","production of cytokines","homogeneous population","cancer","toll","contrast","features","BDCA"],"language":"en"},

To some extent, also the production of proteins that depending on disulfide bridges for their stability has been considered difficult in E. coli. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms keep their cytoplasm reduced and, consequently, disulfide bond formation is impaired in this subcellular compartment. Disulfide bridges can stabilize protein structure and are often present in high abundance in secreted proteins. In eukaryotic cells such bonds are formed in the oxidizing environment of endoplasmic reticulum during the export process. Bacteria do not possess a similar specialized subcellular compartment, but they have both export systems and enzymatic activities aimed at the formation and at the quality control of disulfide bonds in the oxidizing periplasm.

To prevent transmission of influenza from healthcare workers (HCWs) to patients, many hospitals exclude febrile HCWs from working, but allow afebrile HCWs with respiratory symptoms to have contact with patients. During the 2013\u20132014 influenza season at our hospital, an influenza-positive HCW with respiratory symptoms but no fever was linked to a case of possible healthcare-associated influenza in a patient. Therefore, we implemented a temporary policy of mandatory influenza testing for HCWs with respiratory symptoms. Methods. From 3 January through 28 February 2014, we tested HCWs with respiratory symptoms for influenza and other respiratory pathogens by polymerase chain reaction of flocked nasopharyngeal swabs. HCWs also reported symptoms and influenza vaccination status, and underwent temperature measurement. We calculated the proportion of influenza-positive HCWs with fever and prior influenza vaccination. Results. Of 449 HCWs, 243 (54%) had a positive test for any respiratory pathogen; 34 (7.6%) HCWs tested positive for influenza. An additional 7 HCWs were diagnosed with influenza by outside physicians. Twenty-one (51.2%) employees with influenza had fever. Among influenza-infected HCWs, 20 had previously received influenza vaccination, 18 had declined the vaccine, and 3 had unknown vaccination status. There was no significant difference in febrile disease among influenza-infected employees who had received the influenza vaccine and those who had not received the vaccine (45% vs 61%; P = .32). Conclusions. Nearly half of HCWs with influenza were afebrile prior to their diagnosis. HCWs with respiratory symptoms but no fever may pose a risk of influenza transmission to patients and coworkers.","publish_time":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ridgway, Jessica P.; Bartlett, Allison H.; Garcia-Houchins, Sylvia; Cari\u00F1o, Sean; Enriquez, Aurea; Marrs, Rachel; Perez, Cynthia; Shah, Mona; Guenette, Caroline; Mosakowski, Steve; Beavis, Kathleen G.; Landon, Emily","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/038d15e3519eb3d2133698818f573c52113de8cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108074.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza-infected HCWs","influenza vaccine","transmission of influenza","influenza season","proportion of influenza","positive HCWs","influenza vaccination status","influenza-positive HCW","prior influenza vaccination","afebrile HCWs","influenza-infected employees","risk of influenza transmission","respiratory symptoms","case of possible healthcare-associated influenza","temporary policy of mandatory influenza testing","respiratory pathogens","fever","patients","positive test","unknown vaccination status","febrile disease","healthcare workers","polymerase chain reaction of flocked nasopharyngeal swabs","working","hospitals","significant difference","contact","temperature measurement","coworkers","outside physicians","vs","diagnosis","Results","Conclusions","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

These results were compared with findings in experiments with several other intestinal viruses, and it is suggested that some intestinal viruses may be adapted to the conditions of low pH and redox potential that are normal in the intestine.","publish_time":"1972-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adams, N.

In the well-understood classical TGF-\u03B2 signaling pathway, TGF-\u03B2 activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as T\u03B2RII and ALK5/T\u03B2RI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, TGF-\u03B2 may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, etc. The signaling of TGF-\u03B2 is finely regulated at different levels. Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-\u03B2/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops. They can form stable complexes with activated type I receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as Smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type I receptors. Besides, these inhibitory Smad proteins also inhibit TGF-\u03B2/BMP signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, Hoxc-8, and CtBP, or disrupting the formation of the TGF-\u03B2-induced functional Smad-DNA complexes. Smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including TGF-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1 as well as ultraviolet and TPA, and mediates the crosstalk between TGF-\u03B2 and other signaling pathways. Deregulation of Smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis. Overexpression of Smad7 has been shown to antagonize TGF-\u03B2-mediated fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of Smad7 to treat these diseases.","publish_time":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Xiaohua; Liu, Ziying; Chen, Yeguang","journal":"Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/061a9723fabc745b09867090f946f1438e04c12b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["well-understood classical TGF-\u03B2","key regulators of TGF","Overexpression of Smad7","cell growth","Smad signalling","activated type","cell surface receptors","inhibitory Smad proteins","therapeutic potential of Smad7","Deregulation of Smad7 expression","cell adhesion","BMP","functional Smad-DNA complexes","Inhibitory Smads","mediated fibrosis","pathways","carcinogenesis","mitogen-activated protein kinase","tissue fibrosis","growth factor","stable complexes","different stimuli","transcriptional repressors","different levels","transcriptional regulation","bone morphogenetic protein","various human diseases","migration","apoptosis","differentiation","variety of cellular processes","recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases","TNF-\u03B1","inflammation","T\u03B2RII","ALK5","Smad6","pleiotropic cytokine","PI3K","IFN-\u03B3","histone deacetylases","inflammatory disease","degradation","nucleus","immune response","phosphorylation of R","negative feedback loops","Hoxc","TPA","Smurf1","ubiquitination","turn","formation","crosstalk","CtBP","addition"],"language":"en"},

When all cases (whether associated with rotavirus or not) of clinically significant diarrhea (CSD) were evaluated, WC3 vaccine provided statistically significant (P \u003C .01) protection against the total number of episodes of CSD and reduced the number of days of CSD-associated diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or illness. Seventy-one percent of theWC3vaccinated infants had serum antibody responses to the vaccine. The 14 placebo recipients who experienced natural disease predominantly had antibody responses to serotype 1.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) remains a significant public health concern after the epidemic in 2003. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralize SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV) could provide protection for exposed individuals. Methods. Transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes were immunized with the recombinant major surface (S) glycoprotein ectodomain of SARS-CoV. Epitopes of 2 neutralizing MAbs derived from these mice were mapped and evaluated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. Results. Both MAbs bound to S glycoprotein expressed on transfected cells but differed in their ability to block binding of S glycoprotein to Vero E6 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed 2 antibody-binding epitopes: one MAb (201) bound within the receptor-binding domain at aa 490\u2013510, and the other MAb (68) bound externally to the domain at aa 130\u2013150. Mice that received 40 mg/kg of either MAb prior to challenge with SARS-CoV were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs, and doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg offered significant protection. Conclusions. Two neutralizing epitopes were defined for MAbs to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Antibodies to both epitopes protected mice against SARS-CoV challenge. Clinical trials are planned to test MAb 201, a fully human MAb specific for the epitope within the receptor-binding region.","publish_time":"2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greenough, Thomas C.; Babcock, Gregory J.; Roberts, Anjeanette; Hernandez, Hector J.; Thomas, William D.; Coccia, Jennifer A.; Graziano, Robert F.; Srinivasan, Mohan; Lowy, Israel; Finberg, Robert W; Subbarao, Kanta; Vogel, Leatrice; Somasundaran, Mohan; Luzuriaga, Katherine; Sullivan, John L.; Ambrosino, Donna M.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91e8110a78535c9a7c438219cc93011a17c68c62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110081.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110081/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV S glycoprotein","SARS-CoV challenge","glycoprotein ectodomain of SARS","binding of S glycoprotein","SARS-associated coronavirus","murine model of SARS","CoV infection","antibody-binding epitopes","neutralizing MAbs","human MAb specific","neutralizing epitopes","receptor-binding domain","Transgenic mice","receptor-binding region","Human monoclonal antibodies","significant protection","human immunoglobulin genes","transfected cells","Vero E6 cells","significant public health concern","recombinant major surface","SARSCoV","ability","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","lungs","epidemic","virus replication","Immunoprecipitation analysis","doses","exposed individuals","Clinical trials","Results","Conclusions","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

These proteins recognize a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within cargo proteins and import them into the nucleus through nuclear pores, in a process mediated by importin-\u03B2. Recent studies have shown that importin-\u03B1 proteins specifically recognize the NLS of several cellular factors and viral proteins, thus regulating their movement. Dysregulation of importin-\u03B1 is a common hallmark of many pathologies including, multiple cancers. In this study, we isolated aptamers 76 and 72, which bind specifically and efficiently to KPNA2, a member of a subfamily of importin-\u03B11. Both of these aptamers bind to KPNA2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 150 nM and discriminate between KPNA2 and other sub-family members of importin-\u03B1, such as KPNA1 and KPNA3. These aptamers specifically interfere with the nuclear transport of cargo proteins mediated by KPNA2 but neither with KPNA1 nor KPNA3, which belongs to other subfamily of importins. These results suggest that the selected aptamers (76 and 72) warrant further study to explore not only their application in cancer diagnosis but also their use as a specific reagent to potentially block KPNA2-dependent nuclear transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane.","publish_time":"2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yasuhara, Noriko; Kumar, Penmetcha K.R.","journal":"J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c260d5761f75fd51f1181550e2f1d1c71649383.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110145.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importin-\u03B1 proteins","importin-\u03B1 family of proteins","nuclear transport of cargo proteins","eukaryotic importin","importin-\u03B2","Dysregulation of importin","viral proteins","nuclear pores","nuclear membrane","KPNA2-dependent nuclear transport of macromolecules","exportin nuclear transport system","sub-family members of importin","nuclear localization signal","selected aptamers","NLS","KPNA3","KPNA1","study","subfamily of importins","important role","common hallmark","equilibrium dissociation constant","use","pathologies","cellular factors","process","specific reagent","cancer diagnosis","application","nucleus","multiple cancers","Recent studies","results","nM","movement","\u03B11"],"language":"en"},

We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of HCoV that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting. HCoV was detected in 28 (11%) of the 261 clinical specimens obtained from patients presenting with symptoms of RTI ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia. Only 1 (0.4%) of the 243 control specimens obtained from patients without symptoms of RTI showed the presence of HCoV.

The potential for prolonged virus excretion by immunocompromised patients requires further definition, although there is no epidemiologic evidence of a threat to eradication. Survival of poliovirus in the environment is highly variable, but viral inactivation is usually complete within months. Higher primates may be infected with poliovirus, but they are unlikely reservoirs in nature. The only poliovirus reservoir remaining after eradication will be laboratory stocks.

Five clinical entities are described: streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. A wide variety of microorganisms are potentially pathogenetic in these diseases; these guidelines focus on the bacterial infections. Inclusion of a patient in a trial of a new drug is based on the clinical entity, with the requirement that a reasonable attempt will be made to establish a specific microbial etiology. Microbiologic evaluation of efficacy requires isolation of the pathogen and testing for in vitro susceptibility. Alternatively, surrogate markers may be used to identify the etiologic agent. The efficacy of new drugs is evaluated with reference to anticipated response rates. Establishment of the microbial etiology of respiratory tract infections is hampered by the presence of \u201Cnormal flora\u201D of the nose, mouth, and pharynx, which may include asymptomatic carriage of potential pathogens. This issue is addressed for each category of infection described. For example, it is suggested that for initial phase 2 trials of acute otitis media and acute sinusitis tympanocentesis or direct sinus puncture be used to collect exudate for culture. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis also present difficulties in the establishment of microbial etiology. These guidelines suggest that clinical trials employ an active control drug but leave open the possibility of a placebo-controlled trial. For pneumonia, the guidelines suggest the identification and enrollment of patients by the clinical type of pneumonia, e.g., atypical pneumonia or acute bacterial pneumonia, rather than by etiologic organism or according to whether it was community or hospital acquired. For each respiratory infection, the clinical response is judged as cure, failure, or indeterminate. Clinical improvement is not acceptable unless quantitative response measures can be applied.","publish_time":"1992-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, Anthony W.; Hall, Caroline B.; Klein, Jerome O.; Kammer, Robert B.; Meyer, Richard D.; Remington, Jack S.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4631b967f3e9b5a09000edb1513237b698d468c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical response","clinical trials","clinical type of pneumonia","guidelines","acute bacterial pneumonia","Clinical improvement","clinical entities","clinical entity","atypical pneumonia","microbial etiology of respiratory tract infections","establishment of microbial etiology","trials of acute otitis media","respiratory infection","bacterial infections","acute sinusitis tympanocentesis","specific microbial etiology","treatment of respiratory tract infections","Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis","efficacy of new drugs","response rates","evaluation of anti-infective drugs","quantitative response measures","Microbiologic evaluation of efficacy","etiologic organism","category of infection","etiologic agent","active control drug","placebo-controlled trial","present difficulties","direct sinus puncture","streptococcal pharyngitis","pathogenetic","isolation","possibility","tonsillitis","enrollment of patients","initial phase","nose","pharynx","requirement","presence","reference","cure","identification","asymptomatic carriage of potential pathogens","normal flora","wide variety of microorganisms","testing","mouth","exudate","failure","diseases","reasonable attempt","susceptibility","Inclusion","surrogate markers","community","hospital","issue","culture","example"],"language":"en"},

As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.","publish_time":"1994-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavi, Ehud; Wang, Qian; Stieber, Anna; Gonatas, Nicholas K.","journal":"Brain Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzMxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GA","RER","BFA"],"locations":["GA."],"keyphrases":["type of astrocytes","processes","certain astrocytes","resistance of astrocytes","perikarya","action of BFA","primary cultures of rat astrocytes","cells","elements","RER","subset of type","single process","order","organelle specific antibodies","protein processing functions","rat brain","key organelle","antibodies A2B5","secretion blocker","delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein","lysosomes","present study","similar treatment","posttranslational modifications of polypeptides","cultured fibroblasts","PC","GFAP","days","cisternae","prolonged incubations","rough endoplasmic reticulum","plasma membranes","laboratory","striking changes","immunostained structures","large perinuclear masses","studies","mechanism","cytoskeleton","HNK","Golgi apparatus-complex","Brefeldin","drug","observations","contrast","specialization"],"language":"en"},

This finding suggests that RNA viruses with different genome polarity are under different mutational pressure, which may be a consequence of the difference in the strategies of viral genome expression and replication. The GC content directly affects the viral codon adaptation index using highly expressed human genes as the reference set, which may theoretically predict the efficiency of viral gene expression in human cells.","publish_time":"2004-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Auewarakul, Prasert","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114242.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative-stranded RNA viruses","Positive-stranded RNA viruses","coding sequences of RNA viruses","positive-stranded RNA genomes","different genome polarity","strategies of viral genome expression","coding strands","efficiency of viral gene expression","higher GC contents","viral codon adaptation index","human cells","high T","expressed human genes","different mutational pressure","reference set","difference","replication","relationship","distinct patterns","consequence"],"language":"en"},

STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kissler, Stephen M.; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Gog, Julia R.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a9d9bb8c580f32b73f4c69da8a55390bfa81db7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/15e0b5d17622e745db74a08c5d4844b8d00335db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age classes","relative roles of age groups","age-group transmission matrix","epidemic transmission","Elevated STE","asymmetric transmission patterns","reporting rates","observed differences","data","asymmetric transfer of information","higher rates of physician","autumn wave","school-aged children","symbolic transfer entropy","behaviour","year-olds","illness","important transmitters of infection","stochastic processes","time series of influenza","way","measure","US cities","Existing methods","pandemic","adults","reconstruction","ranking","disease","USA","results","simulations"],"language":"en"},

The 50% inhibitory dose (ID(50)) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was \u223C17 \u03BCg ml(\u22121) whereas the ID(50) for FIPV was 2.5 \u03BCg ml(\u22121). The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (\u2A7E4 log(10) reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-\u03B1 ml(\u22121), the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN-\u03B1 alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN-\u03B1 occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 \u03BCg ml(\u22121). Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN-\u03B1 and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN-\u03B1 alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-\u03B1 ml(\u22121) to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN-\u03B1 was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects.

Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3\u2032 most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3\u2032 terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laude, Hubert; Rasschaert, Denis; Delmas, Bernard; Godet, Murielle; Gelfi, Jacqueline; Charley, Bernard","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV strains","TGEV genomic RNA","Expression of TGEV genes","virion RNA","molecular biology of TGEV","peplomer protein E2","genome structure","peplomer glycoprotein E2","single-stranded RNA genome","kDa","glycoprotein E1","transmembrane protein E1","terminal nested set","functional domains","C-terminal anchoring region","structural proteins","envelope proteins","short N-terminal domain","crucial role","lymphocyte membrane","virion architecture","critical neutralisation determinants","complement-dependent neutralisation","major antigenic sites","Coronaviridae","alpha interferon synthesis","direct interaction","prediction","cluster","main aspects","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis","particle","production","family of enveloped viruses","Additional open reading frames","amino half","causative agent","group","non-structural polypeptides","subgenomic mRNAs","nucleoprotein","estimated length","research work","molecule","residues","regions","cDNA clones","Important progress","nucleotides","sequence","polymerase"],"language":"en"},

Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.","publish_time":"2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandevelde, Marc; Zurbriggen, Andreas","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral persistence","Persistence of CDV","mechanism of demyelination","CDV genes","viral proteins","way CDV","chronic demyelination","nervous system","course","disease","cells","period of severe viral induced immunosuppression","ultrastructural evidence of viral replication","Canine distemper virus","glial cell","infected white matter areas","demyelinating lesions","immune response","absence of inflammation","immune surveillance","bystander mechanism","oligodendrocytes support transcription","brain tissue culture studies","antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions","neurons","replicates","non-cytolytic selective spread","progression","degenerate","important role","immunologic recovery","series of experiments","limited budding","Concomitant","animals","restricted infection"],"language":"en"},

The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 or porcine IFN-\u03C4 on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-\u03B1 antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-\u03B1 was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-\u03C4 was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naidoo, D.; Derbyshire, J.B.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Porcine IFN-\u03B1","porcine IFN-\u03C4","peripheral blood leukocytes","mesenteric lymph node leukocytes","TGEV antigen","antiviral activity","porcine gut","porcine interferon","weeks post-infection","days","demonstration of IFN induction","anti-human IFN-\u03B1 antibodies","culture supernatants","leukocyte cultures","donor piglets","various dilutions of purified TGEV","PWM","peak serum titres of TGEV","weeks of age","virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus","clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis","vesicular stomatitis virus","small intestinal lamina propria","neutralization","MDBK cells","groups","basis","trypan blue exclusion","control media","presence of pokeweed mitogen","stability","consistent differences","lymphoid tissue","Viability"],"language":"en"},

Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91\u2013104) and PLP(139\u2013151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. The relationship of the present results to the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis is discussed.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Stephen D.; Gerety, Sheila J.; Kennedy, Mary K.; Peterson, Jeffrey D.; Trotter, John L.; Tuohy, Vincent K.; Waltenbaugh, Carl; Dal Canto, Mauro C.; Lipton, Howard L.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMEV","SJL/J","MBP","PLP","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMEV-specific","specific autoimmune responses","PLP-specific DTH responses","neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses","neuroantigen-specific tolerance","J mice","TMEV-infected mice","TMEV infection","histologic signs of TMEV","chronic demyelinating disease","accompanying virus-specific DTH","humoral immune responses","R-EAE","demyelinating process","myelin breakdown","accompanying MBP","J splenocytes","induction of neuroantigen","myelin basic protein","major myelin proteins","histologic signs of R","altered myelin constituents","apparent absence of neuroantigen","injection of syngeneic SJL","mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates","peptide fragments of MBP","proteolipid protein","development of clinical","present results","present study","major histocompatibility complex","susceptible mouse strains","Intracerebral inoculation of Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","significant suppression of clinical","experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","immune-mediated basis","mouse spinal cord homogenate","heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens","class","MHC","central nervous system","restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity","lymphokine-activated macrophages","effector role","bystander demyelination","immunopathology of multiple sclerosis","possibility","addition","contrast","encephalitogenic","Current evidence","relationship","findings"],"language":"en"},

Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard \u03B3-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2(a) and H-2(d) class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2(b) and H-2(s) products.

In this chapter, an in-depth analysis of these similarities and differences is provided to allow researchers to use mouse models of human disease and primary cells derived from these animal models under the most appropriate and meaningful conditions. Although there are considerable differences between mice and humans, particularly regarding genetics, physiology, and immunology, a more thorough understanding of these differences and their effects on the function of the whole organism will provide deeper insights into relevant disease mechanisms and potential drug targets for further clinical investigation. Using specific examples of mouse models of human lung disease, i.e., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis, this chapter explores the most salient features of mouse models of human disease and provides a full assessment of the advantages and limitations of these models, focusing on the relevance of disease induction and their ability to replicate critical features of human disease pathophysiology and response to treatment.

When they were also asked to rank which is the worst disease that could happen to them, blindness was ranked first by African-Americans and second by Caucasians, Hispanics, and Asians. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of disease progression in the eye is extremely important if we want to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. In addition, developing treatment programs for these various diseases that could affect our eyesight is also critical. One of the most effective treatments we have is in the development of specific drugs that can be used to target various components of the mechanisms that lead to ocular disease. Understanding basic principles of the pharmacology of the eye is important if one seeks to develop effective treatments. As our population ages, the incidence of devastating eye diseases increases. It has been estimated that more than 65 million people suffer from glaucoma worldwide (Quigley and Broman. Br J Ophthalmol 90:262\u2013267, 2006). Add to this the debilitating eye diseases of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cataract, the number of people effected exceeds 100 million.

While most of them show strong antibacterial activities, some, e.g. Brevinin-2R, appear to be promising anticancer molecules, exhibiting better a therapeutic window than widely-use anticancer drugs like doxorubicin. We briefly introduce the field, followed by highlighting the promising therapeutic properties of Brevinins. Next, we provide information about the cloning and phylogenetic aspects of Brevinin genes. In the final paragraphs of this chapter, we discuss possible large-scale production methods of Brevinins, giving examples of some systems that are already in use. Towards the end, we discuss various means of modification of biologic properties of Brevinins, either by chemical modifications or by amino acid substitution and sequence rearrangements. In this context, also other unique properties of Brevinins are briefly mentioned. Finally, we discuss the future of the Brevinin field, particularly highlighting yet to be answered biologic questions, like for example presumed anti-viral and antitumor activities of Brevinin family members.","publish_time":"2014-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savelyeva, Anna; Ghavami, Saeid; Davoodpour, Padideh; Asoodeh, Ahmad; \u0141os, Marek J.","journal":"Anticancer Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8287306c27bd9d7a588b2d948f9e907d46932fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123920.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Brevinin field","biologic properties of Brevinins","promising therapeutic properties of Brevinins","unique properties of Brevinins","Brevinin family of anuran peptides","antitumor activities of Brevinin family members","phylogenetic aspects of Brevinin genes","anticancer drugs","attention","use","possible large-scale production methods of Brevinins","various microorganisms","therapeutic window","anticancer molecules","biologic questions","Antimicrobial peptides","various means of modification","strong antibacterial activities","rich repository of new pro-drugs","amino acid substitution","medical fields","chemical modifications","chapter","cloning","line defense","sequence rearrangements","backbone","science","examples","animal kingdom","information","systems","final paragraphs","end","context","doxorubicin","future"],"language":"en"},

Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics.

There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j\u2640 \u00D7 DBA/2j\u2642 matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baines, M.G.; Billingsley, K.A.; De Fougerolles, A.R.; Duclos, A.J.; Olney, H.J.; Pomerantz, D.K.; Gendron, R.L.","journal":"J Reprod Immunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBA","DBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial pathogens of mice","specific pathogen free CBA female mice","early embryo loss","multiple viral pathogens","mating of CBA","elevated incidence of spontaneous embryo loss","microbial pathogens","exposure of mating mice","DBA","SPF facility","overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption","exogenous factors","animal facility","common murine pathogens","post-implantation embryo losses","matings","number of viral","reproductive success of CBA","pregnancy","fetal resorption","identical conditions","non-SPF","H2","conventional animal care facility","fetal implant","numbers of implantation","role","genetic origins","study","cells","controlled laboratory model","immunomodulatory effects of infection","maternal response","presence","possibilities","immunoassay","considerable data","male strains","culture","activation","events","process","order","animals"],"language":"en"},

Data is presented in accordance with geographic distribution, time and risk classification of the etiologic agents found, according to Ministry of Health regulations. The importance of this epidemiologic surveillance system is presented, debating the main topics required for quality improvement and information analysis. It is concluded, from the analysis of epidemiologic events and their relation to risk management, that the compulsory notification system in Brazil is incomplete, irregular, delayed and, in a large percentage of cases, notification cannot be completed and the agent may not be identified. Quality of data varies from one region to another and from county to county within the same region. There is a high proportion of cases in which the etiologic agent is unknown and, in such cases, a high lethality is expected, establishing a high risk exposure condition for those health professionals involved in health surveillance. From these data, the study points out the need to improve the surveillance system and strengthens the idea of building maximum containment laboratories.","publish_time":"2010-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Oliveira Cardoso, Telma Abdalla; de Albuquerque Navarro, Marli B.M.; Neto, Cristina Costa; Moreira, Josino Costa","journal":"Braz J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Strategic Information and Health Surveillance","Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["Health Surveillance","epidemiologic surveillance system","compulsory notification data","Quality of data","compulsory notification system","health professionals","high proportion of cases","risk classification","risk management","epidemiologic ones","high risk exposure condition","analysis of epidemiologic events","Ministry of Health regulations","information analysis","high lethality","county","region","large percentage of cases","Strategic Information","etiologic agents","quality improvement","infectious diseases","time","Center","geographic distribution","idea","Brazil","relation","CIEVS","present paper","accordance","main topics","maximum containment laboratories","need","importance","study","period"],"language":"en"},

Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.","publish_time":"2003-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erlich, Stephanie S.; Matsushima, Glenn K.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"J Neurol Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzIyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","JHMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific T cell clones","presence of virus","inducer T cell clones specific","mononuclear cell infiltration","suppression of virus replication","brains of protected mice","JHMV","DTH response","CNS lesions","lethal infection","neuronal infection","Previous studies","Protection","increased incidence of persistent infection","fulminant CNS demyelination","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","specific destruction of target tissues","previous data","cellular tropism","cellular infiltrate","Immunohistochemical studies","antiviral antibody response","transient increase","type hypersensitivity","parenchyma","central nervous system","adoptive transfer of delayed","augmentation","survival","ependyma","present report","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Among the important advantages that viruses provide in such studies is their structural and genetic simplicity. The chapter describes the methods for growth, assay, and purification of viruses and infection of cells by several viruses that have been widely utilized for studies of cellular processes. Most investigations of virus replication at the cellular level are carried out using animal cells in culture. For the events in individual cells to occur with a high level of synchrony, single cycle growth conditions are used. Cells are infected using a high multiplicity of infectious virus particles in a low volume of medium to enhance the efficiency of virus adsorption to cell surfaces. After the adsorption period, the residual inoculum is removed and replaced with an appropriate culture medium. During further incubation, each individual cell in the culture is at a similar temporal stage in the viral replication process. Therefore, experimental procedures carried out on the entire culture reflect the replicative events occurring within an individual cell. The length of a single cycle of virus growth can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the virus type.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Compans, Richard W.; Roberts, Paul C.","journal":"Methods Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual cells","single cycle of virus growth","virus type","efficiency of virus adsorption","investigations of virus replication","entire culture","purification of viruses","cell surfaces","infection of cells","animal cells","cell biology","appropriate culture medium","high multiplicity of infectious virus particles","single cycle growth conditions","cellular level","studies of cellular processes","chapter","high level of synchrony","replicative events","adsorption period","viral replication process","low volume of medium","similar temporal stage","current concepts","assay","residual inoculum","genetic simplicity","days","methods","hours","length","contributions","experimental procedures","important advantages","incubation"],"language":"en"},

Conversely, four (5%) foetal brains were considered positive by Toxoplasma-PCR, two of which were also seropositive in the Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA and/or direct agglutination test. The seroprevalence in 1689 cattle sera obtained from 113 dairy farms was 11.5% (95% confidence interval: 9.2\u201313.8) by Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA and 10.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.3\u201312.6) by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA.

Jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers at stages of the infection, and permeability was measured using three probe molecules of differing molecular weights. In control tissue, permeability to horseradish peroxidase was 2.6 times higher across segments with Peyer\u0027s patches than across segments without Peyer\u0027s patches, whereas polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeabilities were the same in patch and nonpatch segments. Twelve hours after infection, when virus had invaded the mucosa causing a structural lesion, and before diarrhea had begun, horseradish peroxidase permeability increased in non-patch-containing segments to equal that across patch-containing tissue. At this early 12-h stage, polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeation were unchanged in patchcontaining segments compared with controls. Ninety-six hours after transmissible gastroenteritis infection, when diarrhea was severe, horseradish peroxidase permeability in patch-free segments had returned to normal and patch-containing tissue permeability was diminished below control levels. Increased macromolecular permeability appears to occur only in the very early invasive stage of this viral enteritis and only in patch-free segments.

There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrhea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections.

K., and Hemphill, M. L., Virology 164, 22\u201329, 1988). In this study, these DI RNAs were characterized by molecular cloning, hybridization with probes of defined sequence, and primer extension. The 7000-nt DI RNA species were found to be authentic DI RNAs which contain a single 2500- to 2700-nt deletion in the structural protein open reading frame (ORF) region of the genome. The 800-nt RNAs were found to be subgenomic DI RNAs synthesized from the large DI RNA templates. Analysis of the extent of the deletions using a reverse-transcription-PCR protocol revealed that the 3\u2032 end of the deletions did not extend beyond the 3\u2032 terminal 244 nts of the genome. The 5\u2032 end of the deletions did not extend into the nonstructural protein ORF; however, DI RNAs in which the subgenomic start site was deleted were present. Following serial undiluted passage of seven independent stocks of RUB, this was the only pattern of DI RNAs generated. DI RNAs of 2000 to 3000 nt in length were the majority DI RNA species in a persistently infected line of Vero cells, showing that other types of RUB DI RNAs can be generated and selected. However, when supernatant from the persistently infected cells was passaged, the only DI RNAs present after two passages were 7000 nts in length, indicating that this species has a selective advantage over other types of DI RNAs during serial passage.","publish_time":"1995-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derdeyn, Cynthia A.; Frey, Teryl K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["T.

It has been suggested that the lamellae may be involved in the sorting of malarial proteins to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of the host erythrocyte. We have previously shown that the lamellae accumulate sphingolipids by virtue of their lipid composition in a manner similar to the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells. In this paper, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that a monoclonal antibody to the lamellae labelled a perinuclear organelle that colocalized with WGA and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in cultured mammalian cells. Immunoelectron microscopy experiments revealed that LWLI labels cisternae of the trans-face and the trans-Golgi network. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions using LWLI detected a 170 kD protein which is associated with the luminal side of Golgi membranes of rat liver and is conserved in all cell lines studied. Our results indicate that (i) the 170 kD protein is a novel marker of the mammalian trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network and (ii) in addition to similarities in their morphological and lipid characteristics, the lamellae induced by P. falciparum in erythrocytes share proteinaceous determinants with the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2005-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wenlu; Keller, Gilbert-Andr\u00E9; Haldar, Kasturi","journal":"Tissue Cell","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LWLI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mammalian trans-Golgi","trans-Golgi network","Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells","trans-face","flattened membrane lamellae","cultured mammalian cells","Golgi membranes of rat liver","cell membrane","kD protein","malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum","lipid composition","immunofluorescence microscopy","lipid characteristics","Human erythrocytes","cell lines","LWLI labels cisternae","Immunoelectron microscopy experiments","sorting of malarial proteins","novel marker","proteinaceous determinants","Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions","cytoplasm","phosphate receptor","manner similar","monoclonal antibody","similarities","sphingolipids","virtue","perinuclear organelle","WGA","mannose","addition","host erythrocyte","paper","results"],"language":"en"},

Female dairy calves (n = 410) born from January to December 1990 in 18 commercial herds in New York state were used. Average daily gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 374, 596, and 719 g, respectively; average gain was 565 g during the 3-mo period. Average monthly height gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 4.4, 5.6, and 5.7 cm, respectively. Use of multiple linear regression, with farms treated as random effects, indicated that treated, verified pneumonia was associated with a reduction in average daily gain of 66 g and that failure of passive transfer reduced average daily gain by 48 g during the 1st mo. During the 2nd mo, neither disease nor failure of passive transfer affected average daily gain. During the 3rd mo, each additional week of pneumonia reduced average daily gain by 14 g, and umbilical infection reduced average daily gain by 96 g. Each additional week of diagnosed pneumonia reduced total BW gain during the first 3 mo by 0.8 kg. Similarly, each week of pneumonia reduced total height gain by 0.2 cm and failure of passive transfer by 0.9 cm. Prevention of chronic pneumonia and umbilical infection may improve average daily gain of calves.","publish_time":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Virtala, A.-M.K.; Mechor, G.D.; Gr\u00F6hn, Y.T.; Erb, H.N.","journal":"J Dairy Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BW"],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["average gain","average daily gain of calves","Average daily gains","total height gain","total BW gain","effects of pneumonia","Average monthly height gains","mo period","mo of life","additional week of pneumonia","verified pneumonia","umbilical infection","failure of passive transfer","additional week of diagnosed pneumonia","Prevention of chronic pneumonia","umbilical hernia","random effects","Female dairy calves","farms","reduction","commercial herds","New York state","disease","cumulative incidence","multiple linear regression","diarrhea","objective"],"language":"en"},

There are a number of naturally occurring virus infections of animals that involve demyelination and many of these serve as instructive models for human demyelinating diseases. In addition to the naturally occurring diseases, many viruses have been shown to be capable of producing demyelination in experimental situations. In discussing virus-associated demyelinating disease, the chapter reviews the architecture and functional organization of the CNS and considers what is known of the interaction of viruses with CNS cells. It also discusses the immunology of the CNS that differs in several important aspects from that of the rest of the body. Experimental models of viral-induced demyelination have also been considered. Viruses capable of producing demyelinating disease have no common taxonomic features; they include both DNA and RNA viruses, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses.

It leads to rearrangements of DNA sequences within genomes. Such genome rearrangements seem to be ubiquitous, since they play a role in evolution, human health and biotechnology. In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed. The need for considering recombinagenic effects as a safety aspect of chemicals has gained ground in the field of genetic toxicology.

In human kidney the colocalization of the two membrane antigens was possible by using several double labelling methods.","publish_time":"2012-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stange, Thoralf; Kettmann, Ursula; Holzhausen, Hans-J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Acta Histochem","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human kidney","human synovial fibroblasts","aminopeptidase N","CD","renal proximal tubular cells","brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells","cell surface of human T lymphocytes","membrane antigens","immunogold labelling","double labelling methods","enterocytes","ultrathin cryosections","dipeptidyl peptidase IV","colocalization","rat small intestine","cytoplasm","vesicular structures","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, 29 calves aged between 7 and 10 days were bought at a local auction. The animals were housed in individual pens to avoid cross-contamination. Fecal samples were examined microscopically for the presence of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts, three times per week for a period of 45 days. Six calves did not pass any cysts or oocysts and were used as controls. Fifteen calves passed Giardia cysts only, five passed both cysts and oocysts, and three passed oocysts only. The villus to crypt ratio index was 1.76 in the control group and 1.08 in the Giardia-infected group. In the Cryptosporidium-infected calves, the ratio was 1.18 and calves infected with both parasites had an index of 1.37. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes per millimeter of jejunum tissue was 21 in the control group. This number was doubled in the calves infected with Giardia, but was slightly lower in the other infected groups. All of the infected calves had intermittent diarrhea and mucus was seen in many fecal samples.","publish_time":"1998-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruest, N.; Couture, Y.; Faubert, G.M.; Girard, C.","journal":"Vet Parasitol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Giardiosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cryptosporidium-infected calves","Giardia-infected group","infected groups","passed oocysts","Cryptosporidium oocysts","presence of Giardia cysts","control group","number of intraepithelial lymphocytes","days","Fecal samples","crypt ratio index","histological changes","millimeter of jejunum tissue","mucus","large animal clinic","crypts","week","times","individual pens","veterinary school","villi","intermittent diarrhea","acute phase of infection","literature","pathogenesis","cross-contamination","study","period","villus","intestinal protozoa","animals","local auction","cryptosporidiosis","parasites","Giardiosis","studies","aims","controls","purpose"],"language":"en"},

A virus is a unique cellular parasite, dependent upon the host for reproduction and nourishment in a variety of different ways. Since, as with the other types of parasites, the host and the parasite have necessarily evolved together. It is a distortion to consider the resistance of the host, without considering the evolutionary steps in the development of this extreme form of parasitism; therefore, this chapter reviews some of the ideas put forward about host-agent interactions in plants as well as in animals. The importance of genes in regulating the resistance to disease, including parasites and parasitoids, is apparent if the disease is considered to be an important evolutionary force. The selective effects of viruses have not yet been adequately studied. Continued attempts to find a correlation between the different blood groups and differing severity of smallpox infection clearly searched for selective forces, but the results were inconclusive. Most of the knowledge of genetic resistance to virus disease rests on the study of resistance to selected agents in various inbred strains of mice and chickens, rather than on any knowledge of the effects of genetic resistance in a natural heterozygous population. The increasing frequency, however, with which genetic resistance is found, is in itself an evidence that these genes are important in natural outbred populations. In addition, there are increasing numbers of virus diseases, in which the viral agent seems to be inherited in a mendelian fashion.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bang, Frederik B.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inherited resistance","study of resistance","knowledge of genetic resistance","effects of genetic resistance","virus disease rests","host-agent interactions","types of parasites","selective effects of viruses","numbers of virus diseases","important evolutionary force","selective forces","importance of genes","viral agent","evolutionary steps","mendelian fashion","animal viruses","increasing frequency","different blood groups","simple mendelian ratios","natural outbred populations","natural heterozygous population","unique cellular parasite","variety of different ways","differing severity of smallpox infection","agents","various inbred strains of mice","development","chickens","nourishment","extreme form of parasitism","reproduction","plants","ideas","parasitoids","chapter reviews","results","correlation","evidence","addition","animals","distortion"],"language":"en"},

In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production - with emphasis on reproduction - is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.","publish_time":"2003-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Booman, P.","journal":"Livest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131807/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of monoclonal antibodies","development of monoclonal antibodies","homologous antibodies","potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies","animal production","reproduction","use of conventional antisera","animal sciences","current technology","hybridoma technology","absolute specificity","number of limitations","inherent limitations","unique specificity","terms of effectiveness","advantages","low affinity","murine counterparts","important tool","areas of application","livestock species","emphasis","constraints","passive immunization","powerful research tools","present review","unlimited quantities","physiological processes","growth","diagnostics","fact","improvements","years","success"],"language":"en"},

Folded RNA molecules are stabilized by a variety of interactions, the most prevalent of which are stacking and hydrogen bonding between bases. Many interactions among backbone atoms also occur in the structure of tRNA, although they are often ignored when considering RNA structure because they are not as well-characterized as interactions among bases. Backbone interactions include hydrogen bonding and the stacking of sugar or phosphate groups with bases or with other sugar and phosphate groups. The interactions found in a three-dimensional RNA structure can be divided into two categories: secondary interactions and tertiary interactions. This division is useful for several reasons. Secondary structures are routinely determined by a combination of techniques discussed in chapter, whereas tertiary interactions are more difficult to determine. Computer algorithms that generate RNA structures can search completely through possible secondary structures, but the inclusion of tertiary interactions makes a complete search of possible structures impractical for RNA molecules even as small as tRNA. The division of RNA structure into building blocks consisting of secondary or tertiary interactions makes it easier to describe RNA structures. In those cases in which RNA studies are incomplete, the studies of DNA are described with the rationalization that RNA structures may be analogous to DNA structures, or that the techniques used to study DNA could be applied to the analogous RNA structures. The chapter focuses on the aspects of RNA structure that affect the three-dimensional shape of RNA and that affect its ability to interact with other molecules.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chastain, Michael; Tinoco, Ignacio","journal":"Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analogous RNA structures","RNA studies","secondary interactions","three-dimensional RNA structure","division of RNA structure","aspects of RNA structure","Backbone interactions","Folded RNA molecules","DNA structures","variety of interactions","three-dimensional shape of RNA","inclusion of tertiary interactions","RNA structural characteristics","possible secondary structures","structure of tRNA","bases","chapter","complete search of possible structures impractical","studies of DNA","stacking of sugar","hydrogen bonding","phosphate groups","combination of techniques","backbone atoms","building blocks","categories","rationalization","cases","Computer algorithms","reasons","ability"],"language":"en"},

RNAs play key roles in the storage and multiplication of genetic information. They are important in catalysis and RNA splicing and are the most important steps of translation. This chapter describes experimental methods for probing RNA structure and theoretical methods allowing the prediction of thermodynamically favorable RNA folding. These methods are complementary and together they provide a powerful approach to determine the structure of RNAs. The three-dimensional (tertiary) structure of RNA is formed by hydrogen-bonding among functional groups of nucleosides in different regions of the molecule, by coordination of polyvalent cations, and by stacking between the double-stranded regions present in the RNA. The tertiary structures of only some small RNAs have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The most widely used approach for the investigation of RNA structure is chemical and enzymatic probing, in combination with theoretical methods and phylogenetic studies allowing the prediction of variants of RNA folding. Investigations of RNA structures with different enzymatic and chemical probes can provide detailed data allowing the identification of double-stranded regions of the molecules and nucleotides involved in tertiary interactions.","publish_time":"2008-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolchanov, N.A.; Titov, I.I.; Vlassova, I.E.; Vlassov, V.V.","journal":"Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probing RNA structure","favorable RNA","investigation of RNA structure","structure of RNAs","Investigations of RNA structures","theoretical methods","different regions","experimental methods","tertiary structures","small RNAs","double-stranded regions","enzymatic probing","tertiary interactions","important types of biopolymers","important steps of translation","chemical probes","prediction of variants","identification of double","powerful approach","high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis","nuclear magnetic resonance analysis","combination","storage","functional groups of nucleosides","phylogenetic studies","molecules","detailed data","hydrogen-bonding","nucleotides","key roles","chapter","multiplication of genetic information","coordination of polyvalent cations","Ribonucleic acids","catalysis"],"language":"en"},

In fact, most basic principles of these processes were first described in viral systems. Furthermore, viruses seem not to respect basic rules, and cases of \u201Cabnormal\u201D expression strategies are quiet common, although such strategies are usually also finally observed in rare cases of cellular gene expression. Concerning translation, viruses most often violate Kozak\u0027s original rule that eukaryotic translation starts from a capped monocistronic mRNA and involves linear scanning to find the first suitable start codon. Thus, many viral cases have been described where translation is initiated from noncapped RNA, using an internal ribosome entry site. This review centers on other viral translation strategies, namely shunting and virus-controlled reinitiation as first described in plant pararetroviruses (Caulimoviridae). In shunting, major parts of a complex leader are bypassed and not melted by scanning ribosomes. In the Caulimoviridae, this process is coupled to reinitiation after translation of a small open reading frame; in other cases, it is possibly initiated upon pausing of the scanning ribosome. Most of the Caulimoviridae produce polycistronic mRNAs. Two basic mechanisms are used for their translation. Alternative translation of the downstream open reading frames in the bacilliform Caulimoviridae occurs by a leaky scanning mechanism, and reinitiation of polycistronic translation in many of the icosahedral Caulimoviridae is enabled by the action of a viral transactivator. Both of these processes are discussed here in detail and compared to related processes in other viruses and cells.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryabova, Lyubov A; Pooggin, Mikhail M; Hohn, Thomas","journal":"Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kozak"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral translation strategies","eukaryotic translation","Alternative translation","reinitiation of polycistronic translation","viral cases","expression strategies","bacilliform Caulimoviridae","basic mechanisms","scanning ribosome","icosahedral Caulimoviridae","study of basic expression mechanisms","linear scanning","basic rules","basic principles","viral transactivator","viral systems","rare cases of cellular gene expression","leaky scanning mechanism","related processes","shunting","virus-controlled reinitiation","downstream open reading frames","small open reading frame","RNA processing","noncapped RNA","polycistronic mRNAs","internal ribosome entry site","details of transcription","capped monocistronic mRNA","Kozak\u0027s original rule","major parts","transport","action","review centers","complex leader","plant pararetroviruses","suitable start codon","genomes","cells","compactness","fact","ribosomes"],"language":"en"},

Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals.

Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 \u00D7 10(4) per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.","publish_time":"1996-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Ruliang; Crowell, Richard L.","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Woodruff"],"organizations":["CVBW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CVB3 receptor proteins","newborn mouse brain cells","CVB3 strains","newborn mouse brain tissue","CVB3 infection","susceptibility of mouse brain cells","cellular receptor proteins","mouse neurons","receptor specificity","newborn stage","CVB3N","virus strains","pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain","myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain","primary astrocyte cultures","Virus binding assays","fetal stage","primary neuron cultures","virus competition assays","larger quantities of viral receptor proteins","cellular receptors","maximal expression","preferential expression","number of virus binding sites","CVB3W","fetal development of Balb","analysis of fetal extracts","high titer","high susceptibilities","coxsackievirus B3","greater amounts","near term","distribution","c mice","day","CVBW","astrocytes","Results","data","relationships","studies","tissues","study"],"language":"en"},

Our findings suggest a role for AP N as a new activation-associated molecule of T lymphocytes.","publish_time":"2011-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riemann, Dagmar; Schwachula, Annette; Hentschel, Michael; Langner, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozc4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PB T","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13 expression of T cells","SF T cells","Fixation of T cells","Induction of CD13 expression","surface expression","PB T cells of healthy individuals","patients","AP N","presence of intracellular CD13 antigen","new activation-associated molecule of T lymphocytes","immunophenotype of lymphocytes","surface protease aminopeptidase N","different types of inflammatory joint effusions","synovial tissue","synovial fluid","rheumatoid arthritis","inflammatory serous cavity effusions","joint disease","juvenile chronic arthritis","JCA","positive staining","findings","peripheral blood","role","correlation","monoclonal antibodies specific","Leu-M7","incubation","obvious difference","Cytofluorometric analysis"],"language":"en"},

The vector-host model considers two patches with different dengue serotype in each patch. The model considers the constant rate of migration in susceptible and recovered class from one patch to other. Recovered migrants from prior infection are exposed to secondary infection in the patch where different serotype is present. The basic reproduction number is computed and analyzed in terms of migration parameters. The model is analyzed for the existence and local stability of various equilibrium states in terms of migration parameters. The numerical simulations for the choice of relevant data from literature have been performed to verify analytical results and to further explore the dynamics of the system. The sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number with respect to migration parameters is carried out. It is found that immigration in a patch increases the basic reproduction in respective patch and vice-versa. The basic reproduction number has been estimated for the two states of Brazil which verifies the occurrence of severe epidemic in one of the states of Brazil.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, Arti; Gakkhar, Sunita","journal":"Int J Appl Comput Math","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e94fc4a1744356edf7ac876a5295aa0294adce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozc5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["terms of migration parameters","respective patch","sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number","states of Brazil","impact of human migration","constant rate of migration","different serotype","different dengue serotype","dynamics of dengue epidemic","vector-host model","secondary infection","prior infection","local stability of various equilibrium states","occurrence of severe epidemic","patches","existence","choice of relevant data","vice-versa","literature","numerical simulations","paper","class","analytical results","migrants","immigration","system"],"language":"en"},

We showed previously that the epidermal growth factor family member Amphiregulin is expressed by T cell receptor-activated mouse CD4 T cells, particularly Th2 cells, and helps eliminate helminth infection. Here we report a detailed analysis of the regulation of Amphiregulin expression by human T cell subsets. Signaling through the T cell receptor induced Amphiregulin expression by most or all T cell subsets in human peripheral blood, including naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 and Th2 in vitro T cell lines, and subsets of memory CD4 T cells expressing several different chemokine receptors and cytokines. In these different T cell types, Amphiregulin synthesis was inhibited by an antagonist of protein kinase A, a downstream component of the cAMP signaling pathway, and enhanced by ligands that increased cAMP or directly activated protein kinase A. Prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, natural ligands that stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, also enhanced Amphiregulin synthesis while reducing synthesis of most other cytokines. Thus, in contrast to mouse T cells, Amphiregulin synthesis by human T cells is regulated more by acute signals than pre-commitment of T cells to a particular cytokine pattern. This may be appropriate for a cytokine more involved in repair than attack functions during most inflammatory responses.","publish_time":"2012-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Yilin; Operario, Darwin J.; Georas, Steve N.; Mosmann, Tim R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2a43da3e565ffb44289385ed3c6a4658dc166c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3375254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A.

We also aimed to validate a recently proposed method of estimation of the physiological dead space (VD(physiol)/V(T)) without measurement of expired CO(2). METHODS: Thirteen patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio \u003C 100 mmHg were included in the study. Plateau pressure (Pplat), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), blood gas analysis and expiratory CO(2 )were recorded with patients in the supine position and after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours in the PP. Responders to PP were defined after 15 hours of PP either by an increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio \u003E 20 mmHg or by a decrease in PaCO(2 )\u003E 2 mmHg. Estimated and measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios were compared. RESULTS: PP induced a decrease in Pplat, PaCO(2 )and VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and increases in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios and compliance of the respiratory system (Crs). Maximal changes were observed after six to nine hours. Changes in VD(alv)/V(T )were correlated with changes in Crs, but not with changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios. When the response was defined by PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio, no significant differences in Pplat, PaCO(2 )or VD(alv)/V(T )alterations between responders (n = 7) and nonresponders (n = 6) were observed. When the response was defined by PaCO(2), four patients were differently classified, and responders (n = 7) had a greater decrease in VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and in Pplat and a greater increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio and in Crs than nonresponders (n = 6). Estimated VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios significantly underestimated measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios (concordance correlation coefficient 0.19 (interquartile ranges 0.091 to 0.28)), whereas changes during PP were more reliable (concordance correlation coefficient 0.51 (0.32 to 0.66)). CONCLUSIONS: PP induced a decrease in VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and an improvement in respiratory mechanics. The respiratory response to PP appeared more relevant when PaCO(2 )rather than the PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio was used.

Dendritic cell\u2013specific ICAM-3 grabbing-nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, also known as CD209) is an HIV-1 receptor that enhances its transmission to T cells and is expressed on placental macrophages. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have investigated the association between DC-SIGN genetic variants and risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among Zimbabwean infants and characterized the impact of the associated mutations on DC-SIGN expression and interaction with HIV-1. DC-SIGN promoter (p-336C and p-201A) and exon 4 (198Q and 242V) variants were all significantly associated with increased risk of intrauterine (IU) HIV-1 infection.

Astrocytes, the most abundant CNS cell type, are highly sensitive to environmental cues and are implicated in both detrimental and protective outcomes during autoimmune demyelination. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in transgenic mice expressing signaling defective dominant-negative interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) receptors on astrocytes to determine the influence of inflammation on astrocyte activity. Inhibition of IFN-\u03B3 signaling to astrocytes did not influence disease incidence, onset, initial progression of symptoms, blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity or the composition of the acute CNS inflammatory response. Nevertheless, increased demyelination at peak acute disease in the absence of IFN-\u03B3 signaling to astrocytes correlated with sustained clinical symptoms. Following peak disease, diminished clinical remission, increased mortality and sustained astrocyte activation within the gray matter demonstrate a critical role of IFN-\u03B3 signaling to astrocytes in neuroprotection. Diminished disease remission was associated with escalating demyelination, axonal degeneration and sustained inflammation. The CNS infiltrating leukocyte composition was not altered; however, decreased IL-10 and IL-27 correlated with sustained disease.

Despite a large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers have been identified in ICUs, leading to poor compliance to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the pandemic influenza. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors, and barriers to compliance with the use of PPE among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during the pandemic influenza. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A survey instrument consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all HCWs in 21 ICUs in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 physicians, nurses, and other professionals were surveyed, and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported having received training program of pandemic influenza before they cared for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported to have adequate knowledge of self and patient protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of PPE, and 55% reported high compliance (\u003E80%) with PPE use during patient care. In multivariate analysis, vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza, positive attitudes towards PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in ICU, and patient information of influenza precautions, as well as reprimand for noncompliance by the supervisors were associated with high compliance, whereas negative attitudes towards PPE use and violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low compliance. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge and self-reported compliance to recommended PPE use among Chinese critical care clinicians is suboptimal. The perceived barriers should be addressed in order to close the significant gap between perception and knowledge or behavior.","publish_time":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Zhidan; Li, Na; Liu, Dexin; Zhang, Li; He, Wei; Zhang, Wei; Li, Yuexia; Zhu, Cheng; Zhu, Guijun; Zhang, Lipeng; Xu, Fang; Wang, Shouhong; Cao, Xiangyuan; Zhao, Huiying; Li, Qian; Zhang, Xijing; Lin, Jiandong; Zhao, Shuangping; Li, Chen; Du, Bin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c701ddbdb052d08eabd99191bd51916a2656ef4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3434157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["use of PPE","violation of PPE use","availability of PPE","components of PPE","H1N1 influenza","self-reported compliance","patient care","high compliance","poor compliance","Chinese critical care clinicians","ICUs","H1N1 patients","use of personal protective equipment","patient information of influenza precautions","training program of pandemic influenza","self-reported behaviors","intensive care units","independent predictors of low compliance","positive attitudes","negative attitudes","numerous barriers","adequate knowledge of self","patient protection","HCWs","perceived barriers","ill patients","significant gap","multivariate analysis","percent of respondents","ICU healthcare workers","significant risk of nosocomial transmission","guidelines","infection control practices","organizational factors","vaccination","SIGNIFICANCE","survey instrument","large body of literature","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","reprimand","order","perception","supervisors","physicians","nurses","METHODOLOGY","provinces","CONCLUSION","total","professionals","questions","noncompliance","China","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Two weeks after the second boost, chickens were challenged with 107.2 EID50 of H5N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus. M2e-specific antibody responses to each of the vaccine constructs were tested by ELISA. Vaccinated chickens exhibited increased M2e-specific IgG responses for each of the constructs as compared to a non-vaccinated group. However, the vaccine construct Tetra-M2e elicited a significantly higher antibody response when it was used with an adjuvant. On the other hand, virus neutralization assays indicated that immune protection is not by way of neutralizing antibodies. The level of protection was evaluated using quantitative real time PCR at 4, 6, and 8 days post-challenge with H5N2 LPAI by measuring virus shedding from trachea and cloaca. The Tetra-M2e with adjuvant offered statistically significant (P \u003C 0.05) protection against subtype H5N2 LPAI by reduction of the AI virus shedding.

Absence of TcaR increases PNAG production and promotes biofilm formation in Staphylococci. Previously, the 3D structure of TcaR in its apo form and its complex structure with several antibiotics have been analyzed. However, the detailed mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family proteins such as TcaR is unclear and only restricted on the binding ability of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). Here we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), electron microscopy (EM), circular dichroism (CD), and Biacore analysis that TcaR can interact strongly with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), thereby identifying a new role in MarR family proteins. Moreover, we show that TcaR preferentially binds 33-mer ssDNA over double-stranded DNA and inhibits viral ssDNA replication. In contrast, such ssDNA binding properties were not observed for other MarR family protein and TetR family protein, suggesting that the results from our studies are not an artifact due to simple charge interactions between TcaR and ssDNA. Overall, these results suggest a novel role for TcaR in regulation of DNA replication. We anticipate that the results of this work will extend our understanding of MarR family protein and broaden the development of new therapeutic strategies for Staphylococci.","publish_time":"2012-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Yu-Ming; Chen, Cammy K. -M.; Chang, Yuan-Chih; Jeng, Wen-Yih; Hou, Ming-Hon; Wang, Andrew H. -J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72ac928abb4394f723426f2e506d71d4892c1036.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3448645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MarR"],"organizations":["PNAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Absence of TcaR","MarR family proteins","D structure of TcaR","understanding of MarR family protein","TetR family protein","mer ssDNA","results","double-stranded DNA","ssDNA binding properties","viral ssDNA replication","strand DNA","single-stranded DNA","regulation of DNA replication","new role","Staphylococci","binding ability of double","PNAG production","novel role","complex structure","negative transcription regulator","development of new therapeutic strategies","detailed mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator","EMSA","electron microscopy","ica locus","apo form","CD","circular dichroism","simple charge interactions","electrophoretic mobility shift assay","biosynthesis of poly","biofilm formation","artifact","N-acetylglucosamine","Biacore analysis","dsDNA","contrast","work","antibiotics","studies"],"language":"en"},

Antisense oligonucleotides annealed appropriately 3\u2032 of a slippery sequence have also shown activity in frameshifting, at least in vitro. Here we examined frameshifting at the U(6)A slippery sequence of the HIV gag/pol signal and found high levels of both \u22121 and \u22122 frameshifting with stem\u2013loop, pseudoknot or antisense oligonucleotide stimulators.

METHODS: We searched electronic databases through October 2011 for the terms \u201Cangiotensin-converting enzyme gene\u201D, \u201Cacute lung injury\u201D, and \u201Cacute respiratory distress syndrome,\u201D and reviewed all studies that reported the relationship of the I/D polymorphism in ACE with ALI/ARDS in humans. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 532 ALI/ARDS patients, 3032 healthy controls, and 1432 patients without ALI/ARDS. We used three genetic models: the allele, dominant, and recessive models. RESULTS: The ACE I/D polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to ALI/ARDS for any genetic model. However, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asian subjects ( P(allele) \u003C 0.0001, P(dominant) = 0.001, P(recessive) = 0.002).

Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.","publish_time":"2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikolin, Veljko M.; Osterrieder, Klaus; von Messling, Veronika; Hofer, Heribert; Anderson, Danielle; Dubovi, Edward; Brunner, Edgar; East, Marion L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb43de0358c05aba59dfb4957432fc2cbe31b30e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dog strains","dog SLAM","non-dog CDV strains","CDV-H proteins","CDV-F","strains of non-dog species","SLAM of non-dog hosts","cells","CDV strains co-evolved","cat SLAM","described cell receptor of CDV","Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein","homogeneous domestic dog population","expression of specialist traits","CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance","higher values","SLAM binding region","increased expression of generalist traits","carnivore host environments","similar values","lower values","virus entry","homogeneous environments","fusion protein","heterogeneous environments","canine distemper virus","higher similarity","higher titers","cell types","lion","carnivore families","virus titer assay","Comparison of amino acid sequences","multi-host carnivore disease","possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry","fitness trade-offs","wild carnivores","Canidae species","heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores","cooperation","evolution of specialists","knowledge","syncytia formation","findings","antagonistic pleiotropy","Y549H","generalists","CD150","functional importance","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Such screens rely on transcriptional activation of reporter genes in the nucleus to detect interactions. Thus, the identification of Nef interaction partners that are integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or other proteins that do not translocate into the nucleus is hampered. In the present study, a split-ubiquitin based yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners of Nef.

We propose using a simulation-based, Bayesian method known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit and assess phylodynamic models that simulate pathogen evolution and ecology against summaries of these data. We illustrate the versatility of the method by analyzing two spatial models describing the phylodynamics of interpandemic human influenza virus subtype A(H3N2). The first model captures antigenic drift phenomenologically with continuously waning immunity, and the second epochal evolution model describes the replacement of major, relatively long-lived antigenic clusters. Combining features of long-term surveillance data from the Netherlands with features of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene sequences sampled in northern Europe, key phylodynamic parameters can be estimated with ABC. Goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the irregularity in interannual incidence and H3N2\u0027s ladder-like hemagglutinin phylogeny are quantitatively only reproduced under the epochal evolution model within a spatial context. However, the concomitant incidence dynamics result in a very large reproductive number and are not consistent with empirical estimates of H3N2\u0027s population level attack rate. These results demonstrate that the interactions between the evolutionary and ecological processes impose multiple quantitative constraints on the phylodynamic trajectories of influenza A(H3N2), so that sequence and surveillance data can be used synergistically. ABC, one of several data synthesis approaches, can easily interface a broad class of phylodynamic models with various types of data but requires careful calibration of the summaries and tolerance parameters.","publish_time":"2012-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratmann, Oliver; Donker, G\u00E9; Meijer, Adam; Fraser, Christophe; Koelle, Katia","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69ef51ebe3e2ce0b8d6fc292b06b293ba2942bd7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/18f11e6900b1a76027c33f5e61ae9cb66d7d2370.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3531293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Approximate Bayesian Computation","ABC"],"locations":["Netherlands","Europe"],"keyphrases":["ABC","features of long-term surveillance data","phylodynamic trajectories of influenza","various types of data","key phylodynamic parameters","epochal evolution model","data synthesis approaches","disease incidence","spatial models","features of influenza","empirical estimates of H3N2","broad class of phylodynamic models","interannual incidence","pathogen evolution","Bayesian method","summaries","antigenic drift","antigenic variation","concomitant incidence dynamics","long-lived antigenic clusters","s ladder","ecological processes","evolutionary drivers of viral diseases","key priority","hemagglutinin phylogeny","tolerance parameters","spatial context","fit analyses","phylodynamics of interpandemic human influenza virus subtype","hemagglutinin gene sequences","infectious disease research","Approximate Bayesian Computation","s population level attack rate","multiple quantitative constraints","northern Europe","careful calibration","replacement of major","irregularity","Netherlands","ecology","waning immunity","large reproductive number","interactions","Goodness","simulation","results","versatility"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which parents\u2019 access to paid sick leave or paid carer\u2019s leave was associated with (a) time taken off work to care for quarantined children, (b) household finances, and (c) compliance with quarantine recommendations. METHODS: We conducted an online and telephone survey of households recruited through 33 schools (85% of eligible schools), received 314 responses (27%), and analysed the subsample of 133 households in which all resident parents were employed. RESULTS: In 52% of households, parents took time off work to care for quarantined children. Households in which no resident parent had access to leave appeared to be less likely to take time off work (42% vs 58%, p=0.08) although this difference had only borderline significance. Among parents who did take time off work, those in households without access to leave were more likely to lose pay (73% vs 21%, p\u003C0.001). Of the 26 households in which a parent lost pay due to taking time off work, 42% experienced further financial consequences such as being unable to pay a bill.

In Japan, it is thought that such behavior may be an indicator of other positive hygiene practices. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine if wearing a face mask in public is associated with other positive hygiene practices and health behaviors among Japanese adults. METHODS: We initially recruited around 3,000 Japanese individuals ranging from 20 to 69 years of age who were registered with a web survey company. Participants were asked to recall their personal hygiene practices during the influenza season of the previous year. Logistic regression analysis was then used to examine the associations between wearing a face mask in public and personal hygiene practices and health behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 3,129 persons responded to the survey, among whom 38% reported that they had worn a face mask in public during the previous influenza season. Wearing a face mask in public was associated with various self-reported hygiene practices including: frequent hand washing (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.67; 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 1.34-1.96), occasional hand washing (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.10-1.75), frequently avoiding crowds (OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.70-1.98), occasionally avoiding crowds (OR: 1.65; 95%CI: 1.53-1.76), frequent gargling (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.51-1.84), occasional gargling (OR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.29-1.62), regularly avoiding close contact with an infected person (OR: 1.50; 95%CI: 1.33-1.67), occasionally avoiding close contact with an infected person (OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.16-1.46), and being vaccinated of influenza in the last season (OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.17-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that wearing a face mask in public may be associated with other personal hygiene practices and health behaviors among Japanese adults.

The annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate, as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed. We used a population-based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza. METHODS: For 2007 to 2010, time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Serfling approach, a time series method, was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics. The contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period. RESULTS: The estimated excess rate of influenza-associated respiratory ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007 (2.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1) than the pandemic year, 2009 (0.76/100,000, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.48). In 2009, the highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds (2.9/100,000, 95% CI 2.2 to 3.6), while in 2007, the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older (9.5/100,000, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.8). In 2009, the excess rate was 17/100,000 (95% CI 14 to 20) in Aboriginal people and 14/100,000 (95% CI 13 to 16) in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009, overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007. Thus, the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under-recognised. In 2009, high ICU use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults, and Aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over-represented in ICUs. Greater emphasis on prevention of serious illness in Aboriginal people and pregnant women should be a priority in pandemic planning.","publish_time":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schaffer, Andrea; Muscatello, David; Cretikos, Michelle; Gilmour, Robin; Tobin, Sean; Ward, James","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539885.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Australia","New South Wales"],"keyphrases":["epidemic of influenza","influenza present","influenza season","intensive care use","epidemic of pandemic influenza","impact of seasonal influenza","CI","estimated excess rate of influenza","peak use of intensive care","absence of influenza epidemics","annual contribution of influenza","classic influenza syndrome","excess admissions","intensive care unit","observed use","high ICU use","low use","expected seasonal use","respiratory ICU admissions","highest excess rate","Aboriginal people","highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate","pregnant women","pandemic year","respiratory illness","increased admissions","seasonal patterns","pandemic planning","impact of recent epidemics of seasonal","health outcomes","older adults","epidemic period","Australia","middle aged adults","time series method","population-based approach","Greater emphasis","Serfling approach","times higher","year olds","prevention of serious illness","various population groups","state of New South Wales","database","inhabitants","H1N1","pdm09","laboratory testing","priority","years","RESULTS","ICUs","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

PPARs have drawn increasing attention for developing novel drugs to treat diabetes due to their unique functions in regulating glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism. The reported compounds are featured with dual functions, and hence belong to the category of dual agonists. Compared with the single PPAR agonists, the dual PPAR agonists, formed by combining the lipid benefit of PPAR\u03B1 agonists (such as fibrates) and the glycemic advantages of the PPAR\u03B3 agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), are much more powerful in treating diabetes because they can enhance metabolic effects while minimizing the side effects. This was observed in the studies on molecular dynamics simulations, as well as on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, that these novel dual agonists not only possessed the same function as ragaglitazar (an investigational drug developed by Novo Nordisk for treating type 2 diabetes) did in activating PPAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B3, but they also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. Moreover, the residues involved in forming the binding pockets of PPAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B3 among the top ten compounds are explicitly presented, and this will be very useful for the in-depth conduction of mutagenesis experiments. It is anticipated that the ten compounds may become potential drug candidates, or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategies or provide useful insights for designing new and more powerful dual-agonist drugs for treating type 2 diabetes.","publish_time":"2013-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Lei; Ma, Ying; Wang, Run-Ling; Xu, Wei-Ren; Wang, Shu-Qing; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f76c950c5c0544362b9bc72614a3f318da4a4076.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3623550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Novo Nordisk"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel dual agonists","PPAR\u03B3 agonists","dual PPAR agonists","category of dual agonists","diabetes mellitus","novel drugs","dual functions","novel compounds","existing diabetes treatment drugs","powerful dual-agonist drugs","single PPAR agonists","lipid benefit of PPAR\u03B1 agonists","reported compounds","effective drugs","new strategies","PPARs","high prevalence of type","metabolic effects","binding pockets of PPAR\u03B1","activating PPAR\u03B1","investigational drug","useful insights","increasing reports","increasing attention","unique functions","cholesterol metabolism","high priority","potential drug candidates","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors","virtual screening","glucose","disease","Novo Nordisk","world","excretion","core","glycemic advantages","fibrates","in-depth conduction of mutagenesis experiments","molecular dynamics simulations","studies","approaches","absorption","distribution","ragaglitazar","thiazolidinediones","favorable conformation","residues","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

The culture within contact sports, such as ice hockey, encourages aggression that puts youth at risk of TBI such as concussion. Newspaper reports play an important role in conveying and shaping the culture around health-related behaviors. We qualitatively studied reports about sport-related TBI in four major North American newspapers over the last quarter-century. We used the grounded-theory approach to identify major themes and then did a content analysis to compare the frequency of key themes between 1998\u20132000 and 2009\u20132011. The major themes were: perceptions of brain injury, aggression, equipment, rules and regulations, and youth hockey. Across the full study period, newspaper articles from Canada and America portrayed violence and aggression that leads to TBI both as integral to hockey and as an unavoidable risk associated with playing the game. They also condemned violence in ice hockey, criticized the administrative response to TBI, and recognized the significance of TBI. In Canada, aggression was reported more often recently and there was a distinctive shift in portraying protective equipment as a solution to TBI in earlier years to a potential contributing factor to TBI later in the study period. American newspapers gave a greater attention to \u2018perception of risks\u2019 and the role of protective equipment, and discussed TBI in a broader context in the recent time period. Newspapers from both countries showed similar recent trends in regards to a need for rule changes to curb youth sport-related TBI. This study provides a rich description of the reporting around TBI in contact sport. Understanding this reporting is important for evaluating whether the dangers of sport-related TBI are being appropriately communicated by the media.","publish_time":"2013-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cusimano, Michael D.; Sharma, Bhanu; Lawrence, David W.; Ilie, Gabriela; Silverberg, Sarah; Jones, Rochelle","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a4760a109394f2d59a82a5831c23ab7ac259eb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3629225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI"],"locations":["Canada","America"],"keyphrases":["risk of TBI","discussed TBI","significance of TBI","youth sport-related TBI","aggression","major themes","youth hockey","dangers of sport","ice hockey","study period","health-related behaviors","major North American newspapers","role of protective equipment","related traumatic brain injuries","potential long-term effects of sport","recent time period","important role","major public health concern","Canada","frequency of key themes","Newspaper reports","culture","violence","reporting","newspaper articles","unavoidable risk","contact sports","perceptions of brain injury","potential contributing factor","similar recent trends","regards","need","earlier years","broader context","rules","rule changes","perception of risks\u2019","greater attention","countries","conveying","solution","regulations","content analysis","rich description","administrative response","grounded-theory approach","quarter-century","distinctive shift","integral","game","concussion","media"],"language":"en"},

Nitric oxide is converted to nitrites and nitrates, thus nitrite and nitrate levels (NO(x)) in serum are considered surrogate markers for nitric oxide. NO(x) are excreted through the kidneys, and elimination is diminished in renal impairment. We assessed the correlation of NO(x) with disease severity in patients with leptospirosis, compared with healthy controls and non-leptospirosis fever patients. METHODS: All patients admitted over a two-month period to the National Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka with a clinical picture suggestive of leptospirosis were included. Leptospirosis was confirmed by the microscopic agglutination test (titre\u2265400). Severe leptospirosis was defined by the presence of two or more of the following criteria: jaundice (bilirubin\u003E 51.3 \u03BCmol/l), oliguria (urine output \u003C 400 ml/day), serum creatinine\u003E 133 \u03BCmol/l or blood urea \u003E 25.5 mmol/l, or the presence of organ dysfunction. Non-leptospirosis fever patients and healthy volunteers were used as control groups. NO(x) levels were measured using a modified Griess reaction. RESULTS: Forty patients were confirmed as having leptospirosis and 26 of them had severe disease. NO(x) levels were significantly higher in confirmed leptospirosis patients compared to healthy controls, MAT equivocal patients and non-leptospirosis fever patients (p\u003C0.001). NO(x) concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with severe compared to mild leptospirosis (p\u003C0.001). Once NO(x) levels were corrected for renal function, by using the ratio NO(x)/creatinine, NO(x) levels were actually significantly lower in patients with severe disease compared to other patients, and values were similar to those of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that high NOx levels may be protective against severe leptospirosis, and that finding low NOx levels (when corrected for renal function) in patients with leptospirosis may predict the development of severe disease and organ dysfunction.","publish_time":"2013-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalugalage, Thilini; Rodrigo, Chaturaka; Vithanage, Thamal; Somaratne, Pranitha; De Silva, H Janaka; Handunnetti, Shiroma; Rajapakse, Senaka","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cceee3984733759b9df0d9e93282fc752e078472.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3651868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3651868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leptospirosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Colombo","Sri Lanka"],"keyphrases":["Severe leptospirosis","confirmed leptospirosis patients","non-leptospirosis fever patients","mild leptospirosis","MAT equivocal patients","clinical picture suggestive of leptospirosis","development of severe disease","nitrate levels","healthy controls","disease severity","high NOx levels","low NOx levels","healthy volunteers","renal function","\u03BCmol","serum creatinine","renal impairment","presence of organ dysfunction","inducible nitric oxide synthatase activity","Sri Lanka","National Hospital","Colombo","relationship","nitrates","jaundice","bilirubin","month period","day","nitrites","surrogate markers","microscopic agglutination test","urine output","following criteria","titre","oliguria","mmol","blood urea","elimination","BACKGROUND","control groups","values","concentrations","modified Griess reaction","CONCLUSIONS","kidneys","correlation","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

When rCRT/18-412 is fractionated into oligomers and monomers by gel filtration, the oligomers maintain most of their immunological activities in terms of activating macrophages in vitro and inducing specific antibodies in vivo, while the monomers were much less active by comparison. Additionally, rCRT/18-412 oligomers are much better than monomers in binding to, and uptake by, macrophages. Inhibition of macrophage endocytosis partially blocks the stimulatory effect of rCRT/18-412.

Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV.","publish_time":"2013-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drexler, Jan Felix; Corman, Victor Max; M\u00FCller, Marcel Alexander; Lukashev, Alexander N.; Gmyl, Anatoly; Coutard, Bruno; Adam, Alexander; Ritz, Daniel; Leijten, Lonneke M.; van Riel, Debby; Kallies, Rene; Klose, Stefan M.; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Binger, Tabea; Annan, Augustina; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Oppong, Samuel; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Rupp, Daniel; Hoffmann, Bernd; Schlegel, Mathias; K\u00FCmmerer, Beate M.; Kr\u00FCger, Detlev H.; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Seti\u00E9n, Alvaro Aguilar; Cottontail, Veronika M.; Hemachudha, Thiravat; Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Osterrieder, Klaus; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Matthee, Sonja; Beer, Martin; Kuiken, Thijs; Reusken, Chantal; Leroy, Eric M.; Ulrich, Rainer G.; Drosten, Christian","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca0c911ee3620b7acdb37a5b5d0b500128205f32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3688547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3688547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C.

A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE for research into the infection dynamics and natural history, impact, or control of pH1N1 in Hong Kong. Eligible articles were analyzed according to their scope. Fifty\u2010five articles were included in the review. Transmissibility of pH1N1 was similar in Hong Kong to elsewhere, and only a small fraction of infections were associated with severe disease. School closures were effective in reducing pH1N1 transmission, oseltamivir was effective for treatment of severe cases while convalescent plasma therapy has the potential to mitigate future pandemics. There was a rapid and comprehensive research response to pH1N1 in Hong Kong, providing important information on the epidemiology of the novel virus with relevance internationally as well as locally. The scientific knowledge gained through these detailed studies of pH1N1 is now being used to revise and update pandemic plans. The experiences of the research response in Hong Kong could provide a template for the research response to future emerging and reemerging disease epidemics.","publish_time":"2012-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Peng; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Wu, Joseph T.; Lau, Eric H.

Existing therapies have managed to limit mortality and control viral proliferation, but are associated with side effects, do not cure the disease and are subject to development of resistance. Finding new therapeutic targets and drugs is therefore crucial. We have previously shown that the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), a C-type lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), acts as an attachment factor for HIV-1 to DCs and contributes to HIV-1 transmission to CD4(\u002B) T lymphocytes (CD4TL). Directly involved in HIV-1 infection, DCIR is expressed in apoptotic or infected CD4TL and promotes trans-infection to bystander cells. Here we report the 3D modelling of the extracellular domain of DCIR. Based on this structure, two surface accessible pockets containing the carbohydrate recognition domain and the EPS binding motif, respectively, were targeted for screening of chemicals that will disrupt normal interaction with HIV-1 particle. Preliminary screening using Raji-CD4-DCIR cells allowed identification of two inhibitors that decreased HIV-1 attachment and propagation. The impact of these inhibitors on infection of DCs and CD4TL was evaluated as well. The results of this study thus identify novel molecules capable of blocking HIV-1 transmission by DCs and CD4TL.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, Alexandra A.; Azzi, Arezki; Lin, Sheng-Xiang; Allaire, Genevi\u00E8ve; St-Gelais, Karianne P.; Tremblay, Michel J.; Gilbert, Caroline","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6682adfe5026c78e3d59b165126abfa8945eb5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3706466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3706466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DCIR cells","infection of DCs","dendritic cells","infected CD4TL","extracellular domain of DCIR","novel molecules capable of blocking HIV","bystander cells","trans-infection","inhibitors","transmission","cure","Raji-CD4","attachment factor","screening of chemicals","Preliminary screening","carbohydrate recognition domain","dendritic cell immunoreceptor","acts","surface accessible pockets","C-type lectin receptor","mortality","identification","EPS binding motif","normal interaction","drugs","study","new therapeutic targets","effective vaccine","D modelling","T lymphocytes","disease","control viral proliferation","structure","particle","development of resistance","Existing therapies","results","pandemic","impact","propagation","effects"],"language":"en"},

Although these are important health problems, an epidemic of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in China has accounted for a much greater burden of disease due to the ongoing rapid socioeconomic and demographic transition. DISCUSSION: Although NCDs currently account for more than 80% of the overall disease burden in China, they remain very low on the nation\u2019s disease control priorities, attracting marginal investment from central and local governments. This leaves the majority of patients with chronic conditions without effective treatment. International organizations and national governments have recognized the devastating social and economic consequences caused by NCDs in low- and middle-income countries, including China. Yet, few donor-funded projects that address NCDs have been implemented in these countries over the past decade. Due to a lack of strong support from international organizations and national governments for fighting against NCDs, affected persons in China, especially the poor and those who live in rural and less developed regions, continue to have limited access to the needed care. Costs associated with frequent health facility visits and regular treatment have become a major factor in medical impoverishment in China. This article argues that although China\u0027s ongoing health system reform would provide a unique opportunity to tackle current public health problems, it may not be sufficient to address the emerging threat of NCDs unless targeted steps are taken to assure that adequate financial and human resources are mapped for effective control and management of NCDs in the country. SUMMARY: The Chinese government needs to develop a domestically-driven and evidence-based disease control policy and funding priorities that respond appropriately to the country\u2019s current epidemiological transition, and rapid sociodemographic and lifestyle changes.","publish_time":"2013-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Shenglan; Ehiri, John; Long, Qian","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d46dd4ec0551a2878ec9537880cdf3291ce7a07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3710110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of NCDs","international health policies","child health problems","important health problems","nation\u2019s disease control priorities","effective control","current public health problems","emerging threat of NCDs","greater burden of disease","overall disease burden","national governments","International organizations","evidence-based disease control policy","frequent health facility visits","China\u0027s ongoing health system reform","funding priorities","effective treatment","local governments","middle-income countries","Asian countries","human immunodeficiency virus","epidemic of chronic","regular treatment","immunodeficiency syndrome","chronic conditions","human resources","country\u2019s current epidemiological transition","demographic transition","past decade","non-communicable diseases","marginal investment","unique opportunity","major factor","fight","AIDS","HIV","economic consequences","lack of strong support","decades","limited access","targeted steps","tuberculosis","majority of patients","medical impoverishment","Costs","developed regions","lifestyle changes","needed care","TB","malaria","donor-funded projects","article","persons","SUMMARY","Chinese government","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P\u003C0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.","publish_time":"2013-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.

In recent years, immunotherapy has become an important therapeutic alternative, and is now the first choice in many cases. Nanotechnology has recently arrived on the scene, offering nanostructures as new therapeutic alternatives for controlled drug delivery, for combining imaging and treatment, applying hyperthermia, and providing directed target therapy, among others. These therapies can be applied either alone or in combination with other components (antibodies, peptides, folic acid, etc.). In addition, gene therapy is also offering promising new methods for treatment.

Previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California were limited by: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen; (3) collapsing of non-spatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large meta-samples that confounded the coalescent analyses. Here, we employ an intensive sampling coverage of 832 isolates of Phytopthora ramorum (the causative agent of SOD) from 60 California forests, genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, to reconstruct its invasion. By using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses, by dividing genetically indistinguishable meta-populations into highly-resolved sets of spatially contiguous populations, and by using Bruvo genetic distances for most analyses, we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire California epidemic. Results indicate that multiple human-mediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations. The study also identifies minor introductions, some of them relatively recent, linked to infected ornamental plants. Finally, using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in California, we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form 3 to 4 core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype. This is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen, and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range.

Although Japanese health authorities have long recommended gargling to prevent respiratory infections, its effectiveness among children is not clear. METHODS: The children in this observational study were enrolled from 145 nursery schools in Fukuoka City, Japan. Children in the exposure group were instructed to gargle at least once a day. The endpoints of this study were incidence of fever during the daytime and incidence of sickness absence. Differences among gargling agents for each endpoint were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 19 595 children aged 2 to 6 years were observed for 20 days (391 900 person-days). In multivariate logistic regression, the overall odds ratio (OR) for fever onset in the gargling group was significantly lower (OR = 0.68). In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 2 (OR = 0.67), 4 (OR = 0.46), and 5 (OR = 0.41) years. Regarding sickness absence, the overall OR was 0.92 (not significant) in the gargling group. In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 4 (OR = 0.68), 5 (OR = 0.59), and 6 (OR = 0.63) years. In subgroup analysis, significantly lower ORs for fever onset were observed for children who gargled with green tea (OR = 0.32), functional water (OR = 0.46), or tap water (OR = 0.70). However, the ORs were not significant for sickness absence.

The number of viruses restricted by this host protein has continued to grow since it was first demonstrated as playing an antiviral role; all of which enter cells via the endosomal pathway. We therefore sought to test the limits of antimicrobial restriction by Ifitm3 using a knockout mouse model. We showed that Ifitm3 does not impact on the restriction or pathogenesis of bacterial (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter rodentium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or protozoan (Plasmodium berghei) pathogens, despite in vitro evidence. However, Ifitm3 is capable of restricting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vivo either through directly restricting RSV cell infection, or by exerting a previously uncharacterised function controlling disease pathogenesis. This represents the first demonstration of a virus that enters directly through the plasma membrane, without the need for the endosomal pathway, being restricted by the IFITM family; therefore further defining the role of these antiviral proteins.","publish_time":"2013-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; McDonald, Jacqueline U.; Kane, Leanne; Harcourt, Katherine; Ahras, Malika; Lall, Amar; Hale, Christine; Rodgers, Angela; Young, Douglas B.; Haque, Ashraful; Billker, Oliver; Tregoning, John S.; Dougan, Gordon; Kellam, Paul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31e1410cb8c22cfaae254381a16e88ec633086e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3836756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ifitm3","late endosomal pathway","IFITM family","family of proteins","antiviral role","antiviral proteins","respiratory syncytial virus","severe influenza virus infections","pathogenesis of bacterial","disease pathogenesis","number of viruses","limits of antimicrobial restriction","broad range of viruses","RSV cell infection","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Salmonella typhimurium","Citrobacter rodentium","protozoan","Plasmodium berghei","risk","halting progress","SNPs","pathogens","humans","interferon-inducible transmembrane","knockout mouse model","need","single nucleotide polymorphisms","sequence","uncharacterised function","cells","plasma membrane","host protein","evidence","demonstration"],"language":"en"},

These receptors detect a variety of RNA viruses, or DNA viruses that express unusual RNA species, many of which are responsible for a great number of severe and lethal diseases. Host innate sentinel proteins involved in pathogen recognition must rapidly evolve in a dynamic arms race with pathogens, and thus are subjected to long-term positive selection pressures to avoid potential infections. Using six codon-based Maximum Likelihood methods, we were able to identify specific codons under positive selection in each of these three genes. The highest number of positively selected codons was detected in MDA5, but a great percentage of these codons were located outside of the currently defined protein domains for MDA5, which likely reflects the imposition of both functional and structural constraints. Additionally, our results support LGP2 as being the least prone to evolutionary change, since the lowest number of codons under selection was observed for this gene. On the other hand, the preponderance of positively selected codons for RIG-I were detected in known protein functional domains, suggesting that pressure has been imposed by the vast number of viruses that are recognized by this RNA helicase. Furthermore, the RIG-I repressor domain, the region responsible for recognizing and binding to its RNA substrates, exhibited the strongest evidence of selective pressures. Branch-site analyses were performed and several species branches on the three receptor gene trees showed evidence of episodic positive selection. In conclusion, by looking for evidence of positive evolutionary selection on mammalian RIG-I-like receptor genes, we propose that a multitude of viruses have crafted the receptors biological function in host defense, specifically for the RIG-I gene, contributing to the innate species-specific resistance/susceptibility to diverse viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemos de Matos, Ana; McFadden, Grant; Esteves, Pedro J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39aba27d479a1340c398f332053951fb33606dcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3842351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DExD/H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mammalian RIG","variety of RNA viruses","evidence of positive evolutionary selection","RNA substrates","selected codons","lowest number of codons","evidence of episodic positive selection","unusual RNA species","long-term positive selection pressures","MDA5","vast number of viruses","specific codons","DNA viruses","cytoplasmic detection of viral RNA","multitude of viruses","highest number","H box RNA helicases responsible","great number of severe","region responsible","receptor gene trees","receptor genes","strongest evidence of selective pressures","known protein functional domains","receptors biological function","diverse viral pathogens","defined protein domains","species branches","Host innate sentinel proteins","host defense","evolutionary change","great percentage","innate species-specific resistance","results support LGP2","family of DExD","susceptibility","pathogen recognition","potential infections","Maximum Likelihood methods","imposition","lethal diseases","repressor domain","binding","preponderance","dynamic arms race","Branch-site analyses","structural constraints","hand","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This causes antigenic variation in infectious agents and a high interindividual variability in the human response to the vaccine. The exponential growth of genome sequence information has induced a shift from conventional culture-based to genome-based vaccinology, and allows the tackling of challenges in vaccine development due to pathogen genetic variability. Additionally, recent advances in immunogenetics and genomics should help in the understanding of the influence of genetic factors on the interindividual and interpopulation variations in immune responses to vaccines, and could be useful for developing new vaccine strategies. Accumulating results provide evidence for the existence of a number of genes involved in protective immune responses that are induced either by natural infections or vaccines. Variation in immune responses could be viewed as the result of a perturbation of gene networks; this should help in understanding how a particular polymorphism or a combination thereof could affect protective immune responses. Here we will present: i) the first genome-based vaccines that served as proof of concept, and that provided new critical insights into vaccine development strategies; ii) an overview of genetic predisposition in infectious diseases and genetic control in responses to vaccines; iii) population genetic differences that are a rationale behind group-targeted vaccines; iv) an outlook for genetic control in infectious diseases, with special emphasis on the concept of molecular networks that will provide a structure to the huge amount of genomic data.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemaire, D.; Barbosa, T.; Rihet, P.","journal":"Braz J Med Biol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92dc5a63d0776632f789e874bb0217c4ac1d021b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3854287.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3854287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic variation","genetic control","protective immune responses","genome-based vaccines","pathogen genetic variability","vaccine development strategies","infectious diseases","overview of genetic predisposition","influence of genetic factors","population genetic differences","new vaccine strategies","infectious agents","infectious organisms","group-targeted vaccines","genome-based vaccinology","antigenic variation","understanding","high interindividual variability","concept of molecular networks","proof of concept","exponential growth of genome sequence information","new critical insights","perturbation of gene networks","interpopulation variations","rationale","special emphasis","outlook","existence","shift","number of genes","human response","combination","major difficulties","tackling of challenges","evidence","genomics","structure","conventional culture","recent advances","immunogenetics","Accumulating results","humans","genomic data","natural infections","particular polymorphism"],"language":"en"},

Previous study has demonstrated that the HIV-1 virus-encoded Tat peptide (\u2018YGRKKRRQRRR\u2019) can increase the yields and the solubility of heterologous proteins. However, whether the Tat peptide could promote the high-yield and soluble expression of membrane proteins in Escherichia coli is not known. Therefore, the prokaryotic expression vector pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD (using pET28b and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD as controls) was constructed, and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and induced with isopropyl-\u03B2-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) followed with identifying by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Subsequently, the bacterial subcellular structure, in which overexpressed the heterologous proteins Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD, was analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) respectively, and the mannose-binding activity of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD was also determined. Expectedly, the solubility of Tat-LSECtin-CRD significantly increased compared to Tat-free LSECtin-CRD (**p \u003C 0.01) with prolonged time, and the Tat-LSECtin-CRD had a significant mannose-binding activity. The subcellular structure analysis indicated that the bacterial cells overexpressed Tat-hLSECtin-CRD exhibited denser region compared with controls, while dot denser region aggregated in the two ends of bacterial cells overexpressed Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD. This study provided a novel method for improving the soluble expression of membrane proteins in prokaryotic systems by fusion with the Tat peptide, which may be potentially expanded to the expression of other membrane proteins.","publish_time":"2013-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Guofu; Wang, Changzhen; Wu, Yonghong; Cong, Jianbo; Cheng, Li; Wang, Mingqun; Zhao, Pengkai; Tang, Li; Zhang, Chenggang; Wu, Ke","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/046a56d635edc933ed8f30ccf1ae9fd488dfe645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3865297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD","Tat-LSECtin","Tat-free LSECtin-CRD","solubility of Tat","heterologous proteins Tat-hLSECtin","pET28b-hLSECtin","mannose-binding activity of Tat","prokaryotic expression vector pET28b-Tat","virus-encoded Tat peptide","soluble expression of membrane proteins","solubility of heterologous proteins","low expression yields","bacterial subcellular structure","ends of bacterial cells","three-dimensional structure","integral membrane protein","significant mannose-binding activity","controls","subcellular structure analysis","denser region","well-established biological activity","prokaryotic systems","Escherichia coli","coli BL21","Previous study","lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin","fusion","human liver","high-yield","isopropyl-\u03B2","aggregation","HIV","inclusion bodies","dependent carbohydrate recognition domain","IPTG","d-thiogalactoside","DE3","novel method","YGRKKRRQRRR","transmission electron microscope","SDS-PAGE","prolonged time","Western blot"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.","publish_time":"2001-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madani, Tariq A; Al-Ghamdi, Aisha A","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1aafb70c066a2068b02786f8929fd9c900897fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC35282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC35282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["King Abdulaziz University Hospital"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Charts of patients","quarters of patients","pneumoniae pneumonia","non-immunocompromised patients","common symptoms","common signs","mortality rate of pneumonia","pneumoniae cultures","underlying comorbidities","culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections","upper respiratory tract infections","infants","RESULTS","crepitations","respiratory specimens","preschool children","pre-school children","King Abdulaziz University Hospital","Jeddah","epidemiology","clinical features","retrospective chart review","published data","finding","Saudi Arabia","age groups","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","CONCLUSION","fall","uneventful recovery","Microbiology records","Cough","fever","bronchial breathing","spring","community","admission","isolates","bronchiolitis","malaise","wheezes","complications"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosing these infections using nucleic acid amplification presents technical challenges, one of which is facilitating the different optimal annealing temperatures needed for each virus. To overcome this problem we developed a diagnostic molecular strip which combined a generic nested touchdown protocol with in-house primer master-mixes that could recognise 12 common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Over an 18 month period a total of 222 specimens were tested by both immunofluorescence and the molecular strip. The specimens came from 103 males (median age 3.5 y), 80 females (median age 9 y) and 5 quality assurance scheme specimens. Viruses were recovered from a number of specimen types including broncho-alveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal secretions, sputa, post-mortem lung tissue and combined throat and nasal swabs. Viral detection by IF was poor in sputa and respiratory swabs. A total of 99 viruses were detected in the study from 79 patients and 4 quality control specimens: 31 by immunofluorescence and 99 using the molecular strip. The strip consistently out-performed immunofluorescence with no loss of diagnostic specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The touchdown protocol with pre-dispensed primer master-mixes was suitable for replacing virus culture for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses which were negative by immunofluorescence. Results by immunofluorescence were available after an average of 4\u201312 hours while molecular strip results were available within 24 hours, considerably faster than viral culture.

Although handwashing is a proven infection control measure, barriers exist in the school environment, which hinder compliance to this routine. Currently, alternative hand hygiene techniques are being considered, and one such technique is the use of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizers. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer interventions in the elementary school setting. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstract, CINAHL, HealthSTAR and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Absenteeism due to communicable illness was the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: Six eligible studies, two of which were randomized, were identified (5 published studies, 1 published abstract). The quality of reporting was low. Due to a large amount of heterogeneity and low quality of reporting, no pooled estimates were calculated. There was a significant difference reported in favor of the intervention in all 5 published studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence for the effectiveness of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer in the school environment is of low quality. The results suggest that the strength of the benefit should be interpreted with caution.

SARS-CoV was discovered in the early spring of 2003, followed by the identification of HCoV-NL63, the fourth member of the coronaviridae family that infects humans. In this study, we describe the genome structure and the transcription strategy of HCoV-NL63 by experimental analysis of the viral subgenomic mRNAs. RESULTS: The genome of HCoV-NL63 has the following gene order: 1a-1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N. The GC content of the HCoV-NL63 genome is extremely low (34%) compared to other coronaviruses, and we therefore performed additional analysis of the nucleotide composition. Overall, the RNA genome is very low in C and high in U, and this is also reflected in the codon usage. Inspection of the nucleotide composition along the genome indicates that the C-count increases significantly in the last one-third of the genome at the expense of U and G. We document the production of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs coding for the S, ORF3, E, M and N proteins. We did not detect any additional sg mRNA. Furthermore, we sequenced the 5\u0027 end of all sg mRNAs, confirming the presence of an identical leader sequence in each sg mRNA. Northern blot analysis indicated that the expression level among the sg mRNAs differs significantly, with the sg mRNA encoding nucleocapsid (N) being the most abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The presented data give insight into the viral evolution and mutational patterns in coronaviral genome. Furthermore our data show that HCoV-NL63 employs the discontinuous replication strategy with generation of subgenomic mRNAs during the (-) strand synthesis. Because HCoV-NL63 has a low pathogenicity and is able to grow easily in cell culture, this virus can be a powerful tool to study SARS coronavirus pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2004-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pyrc, Krzysztof; Jebbink, Maarten F; Berkhout, Ben; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/626347808e0ebaed5176f6a00206c35e48aeb90d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC538260.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC538260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome of HCoV","HCoV-NL63 genome","sg mRNAs","HCoV-OC43","identification of HCoV","coronaviral genome","genome structure","RNA genome","transcription strategy of HCoV","additional sg mRNA","viral subgenomic mRNAs","mRNAs coding","generation of subgenomic mRNAs","ORF3-E","additional analysis","experimental analysis","production of subgenomic","low pathogenicity","b-S","nucleotide composition","study","Northern blot analysis","viral evolution","presented data","N proteins","C-count","SARS-CoV","expense of U","human coronaviruses","discontinuous replication strategy","SARS coronavirus pathogenesis","insight","mutational patterns","expression level","powerful tool","identical leader sequence","presence","following gene order","member","GC content","coronaviridae family","cell culture","CONCLUSIONS","nucleocapsid","early spring","humans","BACKGROUND","Inspection","end","RESULTS","strand synthesis","codon usage"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. METHODS: Parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use (home thermometer). The reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals (hospital thermometer). A difference of \u2265 0.5 \u00B0C was considered clinically significant. A fever was defined as a temperature \u2265 38.5 \u00B0C. RESULTS: The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0.44 \u00B1 0.61 \u00B0C, and 33% of the readings differed by \u2265 0.5 \u00B0C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0.51 \u00B1 0.63 \u00B0C, and 72 % of the readings differed by \u2265 0.5 \u00B0C.

This motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The effects of 3a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. IMPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.","publish_time":"2005-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9eaa4a3217735fbc02153aeea3f34e9c763e5d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC549520.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC549520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["internalization of cell surface spike protein","HYPOTHESIS","cell surface expression of S","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome","viral proteins","viral infection","viral assembly","viral spread","viral pathogenesis","high level of surface expression","coronaviruses","tyrosine-dependent sorting signal","interaction","cytoplasmic tail","cytoplasmic domain","infected cells","open reading frames","replication","SARS-CoV","certain advantages","trafficking properties","unique pathway","intracellular retention","different mechanism","recent publication","separate subgenomic RNA","reverse genetics methodology","interplay","decrease","BACKGROUND","Modulation","homologue","effects","motif","significance","PRESENTATION","IMPLICATION","addition"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes can be identified in poliovirus-induced vesicles, including colocalization of LAMP1 and LC3, the human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8p, and staining with the fluorophore monodansylcadaverine followed by fixation. Colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 was observed early in the poliovirus replicative cycle, in cells infected with rhinoviruses 2 and 14, and in cells that express poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A, known to be sufficient to induce double-membraned vesicles. Stimulation of autophagy increased poliovirus yield, and inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine or by RNA interference against mRNAs that encode two different proteins known to be required for autophagy decreased poliovirus yield. We propose that, for poliovirus and rhinovirus, components of the cellular machinery of autophagosome formation are subverted to promote viral replication. Although autophagy can serve in the innate immune response to microorganisms, our findings are inconsistent with a role for the induced autophagosome-like structures in clearance of poliovirus. Instead, we argue that these double-membraned structures provide membranous supports for viral RNA replication complexes, possibly enabling the nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents, including progeny virions, from infected cells.","publish_time":"2005-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, William T; Giddings, Thomas H; Taylor, Matthew P; Mulinyawe, Sara; Rabinovitch, Marlene; Kopito, Ron R; Kirkegaard, Karla","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d617306cda56236d02117ae7a5fc5e7fcd015554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1084330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1084330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clearance of poliovirus","poliovirus-induced vesicles","express poliovirus proteins","poliovirus replicative cycle","viral replication","double-membraned vesicles","Stimulation of autophagy increased poliovirus yield","infected cells","double-membraned structures","membraned cytoplasmic vesicles","viral RNA replication complexes","sites of viral RNA replication","Infection of human cells","proliferation of double","RNA interference","induced autophagosome","colocalization of LAMP1","Colocalization of LC3","cellular machinery of autophagosome formation","different proteins","hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes","nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents","human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8p","membranous supports","inhibition","progeny virions","microorganisms","findings","staining","methyladenine","mRNAs","components","surfaces","innate immune response","role","origin","BC","fluorophore monodansylcadaverine","autophagosomal pathway","fixation","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the CCHFV life cycle and explore potential intervention strategies, we studied the biosynthesis and intracellular targeting of the glycoproteins, which are encoded by the M genome segment. RESULTS: Following determination of the complete genome sequence of the CCHFV reference strain IbAr10200, we generated expression plasmids for the individual expression of the glycoproteins G(N )and G(C), using CMV- and chicken \u03B2-actin-driven promoters. The cellular localization of recombinantly expressed CCHFV glycoproteins was compared to authentic glycoproteins expressed during virus infection using indirect immunofluorescence assays, subcellular fractionation/western blot assays and confocal microscopy. To further elucidate potential intracellular targeting/retention signals of the two glycoproteins, GFP-fusion proteins containing different parts of the CCHFV glycoprotein were analyzed for their intracellular targeting. The N-terminal glycoprotein G(N )localized to the Golgi complex, a process mediated by retention/targeting signal(s) in the cytoplasmic domain and ectodomain of this protein. In contrast, the C-terminal glycoprotein G(C )remained in the endoplasmic reticulum but could be rescued into the Golgi complex by co-expression of G(N).

We sought to determine whether pneumothoraces are induced by high ventilatory pressure or volume and if they are associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated SARS patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, clinical study. Forty-one mechanically ventilated SARS patients were included in our study. All SARS patients were sedated and received mechanical ventilation in the isolation ICU. RESULTS: The mechanically ventilated SARS patients were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, ventilatory variables such as positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation and the accumulated mortality rate at 30 days after mechanical ventilation were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in the pressures and volumes between the two groups, and the mortality was also similar between the groups. However, patients developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation frequently expressed higher respiratory rates on admission, and a lower PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio and higher PaCO(2 )level during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: In our study, the SARS patients who suffered pneumothorax presented as more tachypnic on admission, and more pronounced hypoxemic and hypercapnic during hospitalization. These variables signaled a deterioration in respiratory function and could be indicators of developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation in the SARS patients.

The GeneMark systems for gene-finding in virus and phage genomes suffer from some basic drawbacks. This paper puts forward an alternative approach for viral and phage gene-finding to improve the quality of annotations, particularly for newly sequenced genomes. RESULTS: The new system ZCURVE_V has been run for 979 viral and 212 phage genomes, respectively, and satisfactory results are obtained. To have a fair comparison with the currently available software of similar function, GeneMark, a total of 30 viral genomes that have not been annotated by GeneMark are selected to be tested. Consequently, the average specificity of both systems is well matched, however the average sensitivity of ZCURVE_V for smaller viral genomes (\u003C 100 kb), which constitute the main parts of viral genomes sequenced so far, is higher than that of GeneMark. Additionally, for the genome of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus, probably with the lowest genomic GC content among the sequenced organisms, the accuracy of ZCURVE_V is much better than that of GeneMark, because the later predicts hundreds of false-positive genes. ZCURVE_V is also used to analyze well-studied genomes, such as HIV-1, HBV and SARS-CoV. Accordingly, the performance of ZCURVE_V is generally better than that of GeneMark. Finally, ZCURVE_V may be downloaded and run locally, particularly facilitating its utilization, whereas GeneMark is not downloadable. Based on the above comparison, it is suggested that ZCURVE_V may serve as a preferred gene-finding tool for viral and phage genomes newly sequenced. However, it is also shown that the joint application of both systems, ZCURVE_V and GeneMark, leads to better gene-finding results. The system ZCURVE_V is freely available at: . CONCLUSION: ZCURVE_V may serve as a preferred gene-finding tool used for viral and phage genomes, especially for anonymous viral and phage genomes newly sequenced.","publish_time":"2006-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Feng-Biao; Zhang, Chun-Ting","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75025fdc2dbeab398880d6e072274409f3dc14bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1352377.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1352377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phage genomes","sequenced genomes","smaller viral genomes","phage gene","GeneMark systems","accuracy of ZCURVE","performance of ZCURVE","main parts of viral genomes","average sensitivity of ZCURVE","new system ZCURVE","better gene","well-studied genomes","phage genome annotations","preferred gene","sequenced organisms","statistics-based systems","tool","satisfactory results","average specificity","quality of annotations","fair comparison","available software of similar function","genome of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus","lowest genomic GC content","HIV","alternative approach","total","hundreds of false","positive genes","HBV","joint application","basic drawbacks","SARS-CoV","paper","utilization","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

However, research has shown that many PH information needs are unmet. In addition to reviewing relevant literature, this study performed a comprehensive review of existing information resources and collected data from two representative PH groups, focusing on identifying current practices, expressed information needs, and ideal systems for information access. METHODS: Nineteen individual interviews were conducted among employees of two domains in a state health department \u2013 communicable disease control and community health promotion. Subsequent focus groups gathered additional data on preferences for methods of information access and delivery as well as information format and content. Qualitative methods were used to identify themes in the interview and focus group transcripts. RESULTS: Informants expressed similar needs for improved information access including single portal access with a good search engine; automatic notification regarding newly available information; access to best practice information in many areas of interest that extend beyond biomedical subject matter; improved access to grey literature as well as to more systematic reviews, summaries, and full-text articles; better methods for indexing, filtering, and searching for information; and effective ways to archive information accessed. Informants expressed a preference for improving systems with which they were already familiar such as PubMed and listservs rather than introducing new systems of information organization and delivery. A hypothetical ideal model for information organization and delivery was developed based on informants\u0027 stated information needs and preferred means of delivery. Features of the model were endorsed by the subjects who reviewed it. CONCLUSION: Many critical information needs of PH practitioners are not being met efficiently or at all. We propose a dual strategy of: 1) promoting incremental improvements in existing information delivery systems based on the expressed preferences of the PH users of the systems and 2) the concurrent development and rigorous evaluation of new models of information organization and delivery that draw on successful resources already operating to deliver information to clinical medical practitioners.","publish_time":"2006-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaPelle, Nancy R; Luckmann, Roger; Simpson, E Hatheway; Martin, Elaine R","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cda5efb9ec3966e7cd1df793ff55b51d9611eec3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1456961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available information","credible information","PH information needs","information format","methods of information access","improved information access","existing information delivery systems","new systems of information organization","best practice information","critical information needs of PH practitioners","informants\u0027 stated information needs","comprehensive review of existing information resources","rigorous evaluation of new models of information organization","improved access","effective PH practices","ideal systems","PH users","similar needs","representative PH groups","better methods","expressed preferences","single portal access","preferred means of delivery","health risks","public health","Qualitative methods","evidence-based practices","state health department","community health promotion","current practices","hypothetical ideal model","Subsequent focus groups","additional data","grey literature","successful resources","effective ways","relevant literature","clinical medical practitioners","communicable disease control","good search engine","automatic notification","fields","concurrent development","biomedical subject matter","incremental improvements","study","text articles","indexing","summaries","employees","themes","domains","Movement","listservs","areas","challenges","filtering","PubMed","BACKGROUND","individual interviews","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","group transcripts","systematic reviews","content","research","dual strategy","Features","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Allergic asthmatics are more susceptible to RSV infection and viral exacerbation. METHODS: Since the effectiveness of corticosteroids in treating RSV infection has been controversial, we tested fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol (Sal) alone versus FP plus Sal (FPS) on RSV-induced airway inflammation. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and infected with RSV. Following infection they were treated with FP, Sal, or FPS intranasally and airway hyperreactivity (AHR), inflammation and RSV titers were examined. RESULTS: The group treated with FPS showed significantly lower AHR compared to the group treated with FP or Sal alone. The group treated with FP alone showed slightly decreased (non-significant) AHR compared to controls. Treatment with FPS resulted in significant decreases in the percentage of eosinophils and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in lung pathology compared to FP or Sal. FP alone decreased eosinophils but not neutrophils or lymphocytes, while Sal alone decreased eosinophils and neutrophils but not lymphocytes. FPS treatment of mice infected with RSV in the absence of allergen sensitization resulted in a 50% decrease of RSV titer in the lung and a reduction in neutrophils compared to FP or Sal. CONCLUSION: Together, these results indicate that fluticasone in combination with salmeterol is a more effective treatment for decreasing airway hyperreactivity and inflammation than either of them alone in allergen-sensitized, RSV-infected mice.","publish_time":"2006-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singam, Rajeswari; Jena, Prasanna K; Behera, Sumita; Hellermann, Gary R; Lockey, Richard F; Ledford, Dennis; Mohapatra, Shyam S","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1f86a8d26afcb49621b2b3aba8eaf1851b95315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1488829.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1488829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sal"],"organizations":["RSV","FP plus Sal","FPS","FP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","RSV titers","RSV-infected mice","neutrophils","RSV-induced airway inflammation","FPS treatment of mice","FPS intranasally","decreased eosinophils","group","percentage of eosinophils","decreasing airway hyperreactivity","effective treatment","salmeterol","lymphocytes","lower AHR","RESULTS","lung pathology","significant decreases","fluticasone propionate","absence of allergen sensitization","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","infants","major cause of bronchiolitis","Respiratory syncytial virus","risk factor","BACKGROUND","combination","effectiveness of corticosteroids","viral exacerbation","reduction","Allergic asthmatics","development of asthma","controls","ovalbumin","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Advantages of live bacterial vaccines include their mimicry of a natural infection, intrinsic adjuvant properties and their possibility to be administered orally. Derivatives of pathogenic and non-pathogenic food related bacteria are currently being evaluated as live vaccines. However, pathogenic bacteria demands for attenuation to weaken its virulence. The use of bacteria as vaccine delivery vehicles implies construction of recombinant strains that contain the gene cassette encoding the antigen. With the increased knowledge of mucosal immunity and the availability of genetic tools for heterologous gene expression the concept of live vaccine vehicles gains renewed interest. However, administration of live bacterial vaccines poses some risks. In addition, vaccination using recombinant bacteria results in the release of live recombinant organisms into nature. This places these vaccines in the debate on application of genetically modified organisms. In this review we give an overview of live bacterial vaccines on the market and describe the development of new live vaccines with a focus on attenuated bacteria and food-related lactic acid bacteria. Furthermore, we outline the safety concerns and identify the hazards associated with live bacterial vaccines and try to give some suggestions of what to consider during their development.","publish_time":"2006-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Detmer, Ann; Glenting, Jacob","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67727dc7bb076ef6ddeb55c754af98e672ee60e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1538998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1538998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of live bacteria","overview of live bacterial vaccines","Advantages of live bacterial vaccines","administration of live bacterial vaccines","development of new live vaccines","pathogenic bacteria","use of bacteria","concept of live vaccine vehicles","attenuated bacteria","release of live recombinant organisms","recombinant bacteria results","non-pathogenic food related bacteria","food-related lactic acid bacteria","vaccine delivery vehicles","carried vaccine component","attractive vaccine strategy","construction of recombinant strains","gene cassette","Derivatives of pathogenic","modified organisms","heterologous gene expression","availability of genetic tools","mimicry","focus","natural infection","intrinsic adjuvant properties","debate","hazards","market","increased knowledge of mucosal immunity","application","addition","vaccination","nature","immune response","possibility","attenuation","risks","safety concerns","antigen","places","review","virulence","suggestions"],"language":"en"},

Some of these cases may be caused by the recently described human bocavirus (hBoV). The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and the potential clinical relevance of hBoV in pediatric patients. METHODS: We tested 835 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) obtained between 2002 and 2005 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases at the University of W\u00FCrzburg, Germany, for the presence of hBoV DNA. The specificity of positive PCR reactions was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was found in 87 (10.3 %) of the NPAs. The median age of the infants and children with hBoV infection was 1.8 years (mean age 2.0 years; range 18 days \u2013 8 years). Infections with hBoV were found year-round, though most occurred in the winter months. Coinfections were found in 34 (39.1 %) of the hBoV positive samples. RSV, influenza A, and adenoviruses were most frequently detected as coinfecting agents. Sequence determination of the PCR products in the NP-1 region revealed high identity (99 %) between the nucleotide sequences obtained in different years and in comparison to the Swedish viruses ST1 and ST2. An association of hBoV with a distinct respiratory tract manifestation was not apparent. CONCLUSION: HBoV is frequently found in NPAs of hospitalized infants and children with acute respiratory tract diseases. Proving the clinical relevance of hBoV is challenging, because application of some of Koch\u0027s revised postulates is not possible. Because of the high rate of coinfections with hBoV and other respiratory tract pathogens, an association between hBoV and respiratory tract diseases remains unproven.","publish_time":"2006-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weissbrich, Benedikt; Neske, Florian; Schubert, J\u00F6rg; Tollmann, Franz; Blath, Katharina; Blessing, Kerstin; Kreth, Hans Wolfgang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/976dd497031581e697cbf2d98042f7c184e9fb40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1550408.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["association of hBoV","hBoV infection","hBoV positive samples","presence of hBoV DNA","acute respiratory tract diseases","respiratory tract pathogens","potential clinical relevance of hBoV","distinct respiratory tract manifestation","substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases of suspected infectious origin","different years","children","NPAs of hospitalized infants","high rate of coinfections","mean age","pediatric in-patients","pediatric patients","PCR products","median age","specificity of positive PCR reactions","high identity","University of W\u00FCrzburg","comparison","range","Swedish viruses ST1","Koch\u0027s revised postulates","etiology","region","frequency","application","Germany","days","adenoviruses","nasopharyngeal aspirates","ST2","Sequence determination","nucleotide sequences","sequencing","RSV","influenza","study","METHODS","BACKGROUND","human bocavirus","RESULTS","coinfecting agents","winter months","aim","CONCLUSION","cases"],"language":"en"},

It has been anticipated that the integration of nanoscale chemical structures such as self-assembled monolayers with electrochemical biosensors would increase sensitivity by decreasing inherent system noise. We have designed a novel biosensing approach incorporating such integration and achieved rapid, ultra-low concentration sensitivities without target amplification. Raw samples are mixed with lysis buffer to allow hybridization of nucleic acid targets with anchor and signal probes before immobilizing a signaling enzyme proximate to the biosensor surface. A bias potential is subsequently applied and the secondary byproduct of a cyclic peroxidase reaction measured. Further studies have demonstrated the application of our approach in protein, clinical chemistry, and ionic assays.","publish_time":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gau, Vincent; Ma, Shu-Ching; Wang, Hua; Tsukuda, Joni; Kibler, John; Haake, David A.","journal":"Methods","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1564062.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1564062?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.","publish_time":"2006-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klinkenberg, Don; Fraser, Christophe; Heesterbeek, Hans","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6af02873a430f5f75dc56a917f26feaea89b8e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1762362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of tracing","tracing effectiveness","effective tracing","Contact tracing","tracing delays","iterative tracing","tracing process","likely success of tracing","single-step tracing","express effectiveness","foot","SARS","control of smallpox","variability","influenza","proportion of contacts","various aspects of time","mouth disease epidemics","emerging epidemic","control of emerging infectious diseases","general results","asymptomatic infecteds","symptom-based detection","generic mathematical model","isolation of symptomatic infecteds","general predictive formula","important role","basic scenario","latent period","duration","respect","special cases","course of individual infectivity","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","brink","possibility","reproduction ratio smaller","METHODS","insights","addition","infections","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This article describes the study design and methods being used to conduct a systems-level analysis of public health preparedness in the province of Alberta, Canada. The project is being funded under the Health Research Fund, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. METHODS/DESIGN: We use an embedded, multiple-case study design, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to measure empirically the degree of inter-organizational coordination existing among public health agencies in Alberta, Canada. We situate our measures of inter-organizational network ties within a systems-level framework to assess the relative influence of inter-organizational ties, individual organizational attributes, and institutional environmental features on public health preparedness. The relative contribution of each component is examined for two potential public health threats: pandemic influenza and West Nile virus. DISCUSSION: The organizational dimensions of public health preparedness depend on a complex mix of individual organizational characteristics, inter-agency relationships, and institutional environmental factors. Our study is designed to discriminate among these different system components and assess the independent influence of each on the other, as well as the overall level of public health preparedness in Alberta. While all agree that competent organizations and functioning networks are important components of public health preparedness, this study is one of the first to use formal network analysis to study the role of inter-agency networks in the development of prepared public health systems.","publish_time":"2006-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Douglas; Shiell, Alan; Noseworthy, Tom; Russell, Margaret; Predy, Gerald","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53dbd21da3e3a026ab15e946639b45970d6304de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1779785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1779785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Research Fund, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research"],"locations":["Canada","Alberta","West Nile"],"keyphrases":["public health agencies","organizational dimensions of public health preparedness","Canadian public health system","potential public health threats","overall level of public health preparedness","important components of public health preparedness","systems-level analysis of public health preparedness","development of prepared public health systems","Health Research Fund","various types of contemporary public health threats","relative influence of inter-organizational ties","degree of inter-organizational coordination","measures of inter-organizational network ties","individual organizational attributes","inter-agency relationships","role of inter-agency networks","province of Alberta","multiple-case study design","systems-level framework","complex mix of individual organizational characteristics","Alberta Heritage Foundation","different system components","quantitative methods","Canada","institutional environmental features","institutional environmental factors","formal network analysis","functioning networks","Medical Research","independent influence","relative contribution","pandemic influenza","critical attention","national events","West Nile virus","competent organizations","BACKGROUND","article","DISCUSSION","project"],"language":"en"},

The use of siRNA and shRNA as antiviral therapeutic is limited because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. This problem is theoretically prevented by intracellular expression of lhRNAs generating multiple siRNAs that target the virus simultaneously, thus reducing the chance of viral escape. However, gene constructs encoding lhRNA molecules face problems with delivery to the right cells in an infected individual. In order to solve this problem, we constructed an HIV-1 variant with a 300 bp long hairpin structure in the 3\u0027 part of the genome corresponding to the Nef gene (HIV-lhNef). RESULTS: Intriguingly, HIV-lhNef potently inhibited wild-type HIV-1 production in trans. However, HIV-lhNef demonstrated a severe production and replication defect, which we were able to solve by selecting spontaneous virus variants with truncated hairpin structures. Although these escape variants lost the ability to trans-inhibit HIV-1, they effectively outgrew the wild-type virus in competition experiments in SupT1 cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of the lhNef hairpin within the HIV-1 genome results in potent trans-inhibition of wild-type HIV-1. Although the mechanism of trans-inhibition is currently unknown, it remains of interest to study the molecular details because the observed effect is extremely potent. This may have implications for the development of virus strains to be used as live-attenuated virus vaccines.","publish_time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konstantinova, Pavlina; ter Brake, Olivier; Haasnoot, Joost; de Haan, Peter; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c4528b1cf4a44cba63268ee2a4d20370626ba87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1819390.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1819390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV-lhNef","wild-type HIV","lhNef hairpin","wild-type virus","short hairpin RNAs","long hairpin RNAs","Human immunodeficiency virus type","spontaneous virus variants","development of virus strains","gene constructs","potent trans-inhibition of wild","escape variants","truncated hairpin structures","bp long hairpin structure","live-attenuated virus vaccines","Nef gene","mechanism of trans-inhibition","genome results","chance of viral escape","synthetic short interfering RNAs","emergence of viral escape mutants","intracellular expression of lhRNAs","multiple siRNAs","right cells","SupT1 cells","severe production","RNAi","lhRNA molecules face problems","shRNAs","delivery","competition experiments","interference","replication defect","observed effect","BACKGROUND","ability","use of siRNA","molecular details","RNA silencing","infected individual","implications","CONCLUSION","order"],"language":"en"},

A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i. VP27 and domain 4 in ORF1a) more than at domains dedicated to intrinsic virus functions (f.i. VP34 and ORF1b (the virus polymerase)).

Nevertheless, there is increasing interest in characterizing the neutralizing antibodies in the serum of HCV-infected patients. Focus reduction assays have been widely used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against a range of non-cytopathic viruses. Based on the recent development of a HCV cell culture system using the genotype 2 JFH-1-strain, we developed a focus reduction assay for HCV-neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: The focus reduction assay was based on a standard microneutralization assay in which immunostained foci on tissue culture plates are counted. The neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies titers of purified serum immunoglobulin samples from seventy-seven individuals were determined using a 50% focus reduction neutralization assay. Each titer was determined as the log value of the reciprocal antibody dilution that reduced the number of viral foci by 50%. IgG antibodies were first purified from each serum in order to avoid the facilitating effect of HDL on HCV entry. RESULTS: The assay\u0027s cut-off using an ELISA and RNA HCV-negative samples was found to be 1.25 log, corresponding to a dilution of 1:18. The assay was compared with a commercial HCV ELISA and exhibited specificity and sensitivity values of 100% and 96.5%, respectively, and good reproducibility (with intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 6.7% and 12.6%, respectively). The assay did not show any cross-reactivity with anti-HIV, anti-HBs or heterophile antibody-positive samples. The neutralizing antibodies titers were 2.13 log (1:134) for homologous samples from HCV genotype 2 infected patients harboring the same genotype as JFH-1 and 1.93 log (1:85) for heterologous samples from patients infected by genotypes other than type 2. These results confirm the presence of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies already reported using the HCV pseudoparticles system. CONCLUSION: This study presents a simple, specific and reproducible cell culture-based assay for determination of HCV-neutralizing antibodies in human sera. The assay should be an important tool for gauging the relationship between the neutralizing antibodies response and viral load kinetics in acutely or chronically infected patients and for investigating the possible eradication or prevention of HCV infection by neutralizing antibodies.","publish_time":"2007-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fournier, Carole; Duverlie, Gilles; Fran\u00E7ois, Catherine; Schnuriger, Aurelie; Dedeurwaerder, Sarah; Brochot, Etienne; Capron, Dominique; Wychowski, Czeslaw; Thibault, Vincent; Castelain, Sandrine","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee8dca216514deeed4c9415bc2ad8a78dc3d9670.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1852297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV ELISA","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum of HCV","HCV genotype","neutralizing antibodies titers","determination of HCV","HCV entry","neutralizing antibodies response","focus reduction assay","intra-assay","neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies titers of purified serum immunoglobulin samples","commercial HCV ELISA","prevention of HCV infection","HCV pseudoparticles system","IgG antibodies","HCV cell culture system","RNA HCV-negative samples","focus reduction neutralization assay","neutralizing antibody responses","standard microneutralization assay","infected patients","reproducible cell culture-based assay","inter-assay coefficients of variation","homologous samples","heterologous samples","heterophile antibody-positive samples","log value","reduction assays","anti-HBs","anti-HIV","reciprocal antibody dilution","JFH","RESULTS","tissue culture plates","number of viral foci","cross-reactivity","viral load kinetics","hepatitis C virus","role of humoral immunity","exhibited specificity","possible eradication","facilitating effect of HDL","relationship","range of non-cytopathic viruses","sensitivity values","assay\u0027s cut-off","recent development","AIM","genotypes","individuals","strain","good reproducibility","study","order","important tool","presence","human sera","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This discovery resulted in a search for NADPH oxidase-activating substances as a potential new approach to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have recently shown that compounds inducing NCF1-dependent oxidative burst, e.g. phytol, have a strong ameliorating effect on arthritis in rats. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to use gene-expression profiling to understand the protective effect against arthritis of activation of NADPH oxidase in the immune system. RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of phytol leads to an accumulation of the compound in the inguinal lymph nodes, with peak levels being reached approximately 10 days after administration. Hence, global gene-expression profiling on inguinal lymph nodes was performed 10 days after the induction of pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) and phytol administration. The differentially expressed genes could be divided into two pathways, consisting of genes regulated by different interferons. IFN-\u03B3 regulated the pathway associated with arthritis development, whereas IFN-\u03B2 regulated the pathway associated with disease protection through phytol. Importantly, these two molecular pathways were also confirmed to differentiate between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti (DA) rat, (with an Ncf-1(DA )allele that allows only low oxidative burst), and the arthritis-protected DA.Ncf-1(E3 )rat (with an Ncf1(E3 )allele that allows a stronger oxidative burst). CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms in the Ncf-1 gene modulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase complex, which strongly regulates the severity of arthritis. We now show that the Ncf-1 allele that enhances oxidative burst and protects against arthritis is operating through an IFN-\u03B2-associated pathway, whereas the arthritis-driving allele operates through an IFN-\u03B3-associated pathway. Treatment of arthritis-susceptible rats with an NADPH oxidase-activating substance, phytol, protects against arthritis. Interestingly, the treatment led to a restoration of the oxidative-burst effect and induction of a strikingly similar IFN-\u03B2-dependent pathway, as seen with the disease-protective Ncf1 polymorphism.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olofsson, Peter; Nerstedt, Annika; Hultqvist, Malin; Nilsson, Elisabeth C; Andersson, Sofia; Bergelin, Anna; Holmdahl, Rikard","journal":"BMC Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ff2f23a621ca476cd59ade285f8b9198ca178fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1884140.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NADPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of arthritis","Treatment of arthritis","arthritis of activation","induced arthritis","rheumatoid arthritis","arthritis development","arthritis-protected DA","regulator of arthritis severity","associated pathway","oxidative-burst effect","arthritis-susceptible dark agouti","NADPH oxidase complex","allele","NCF1-dependent oxidative burst","phytol administration","stronger oxidative burst","low oxidative burst","dependent pathway","IFN-\u03B3","similar IFN-\u03B2","Subcutaneous administration of phytol","protective effect","susceptible rats","disease-protective Ncf1 polymorphism","inguinal lymph nodes","global gene-expression profiling","days","E3","activating component","genes","molecular pathways","strong ameliorating effect","induction of pristane","disease protection","underlying molecular mechanism","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","autoimmune disorders","substances","neutrophil cytosolic factor","potential new approach","peak levels","PIA","activity","search","accumulation","mice","restoration","compounds","genetic polymorphisms","immune system","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","different interferons","discovery","BACKGROUND","aim"],"language":"en"},

GC-clamp-containing PCR products from interrogated and wild-type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in-parallel. Mismatches are converted to double-strand breaks using a DNA endonuclease (Surveyor\u2122) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations.

Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner.

These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses.","publish_time":"2007-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weng, Ziming; Barthelson, Roger; Gowda, Siddarame; Hilf, Mark E.; Dawson, William O.; Galbraith, David W.; Xiong, Zhongguo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c235de11eceb5f9f55e0b361818e959d4482b621.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1975466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1975466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major genotypes","major CTV genotypes","persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes","multiple viral genotypes co-replicate","viral populations","introduction of new genotypes","number of minor genotypes","reassortment of viral genomes","subsequent recombination","major processes","large-scale production of viral genetic variants","single host","host organism","promiscuous recombination","creation of new","large number of genetic variants","novel host","subsequent divergence","abundant genotypic variants","genotypic complexity","emerging viruses","Subsequent deep sequencing analysis","long-term persistent infections","Citrus tristeza virus","co-replication","successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues","hundreds of years","vector transmission","presence","addition","plants","pathogenicity traits","recombinants","data","resequencing microarray","important fruit crop","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Observations that orthologues show almost no variation across vertebrates yet differ by two amino acids between humans and chimpanzees have led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes might relate to the emergence of language. Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and often for prey capture. To determine whether mutations in the FoxP2 gene could be associated with echolocation, we sequenced FoxP2 from echolocating and non-echolocating bats as well as a range of other mammal species. We found that contrary to previous reports, FoxP2 is not highly conserved across all nonhuman mammals but is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. We detected divergent selection (a change in selective pressure) at FoxP2 between bats with contrasting sonar systems, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a role for FoxP2 in the evolution and development of echolocation. We speculate that observed accelerated evolution of FoxP2 in bats supports a previously proposed function in sensorimotor coordination.","publish_time":"2007-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Gang; Wang, Jinhong; Rossiter, Stephen J.; Jones, Gareth; Zhang, Shuyi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6073be83bd1d0e2748019760bbba8ffcb6ab8fac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1976393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1976393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FoxP2 gene","non-echolocating bats","accelerated evolution of FoxP2","sensorimotor coordination","development of echolocation","challenging sensorimotor demands","neural control of orofacial coordination","contrasting sonar systems","vocal signals","intriguing possibility","selective pressure","speculation","chimpanzees","orientation","proposed function","vertebrates","recent evolutionary changes","amino acids","humans","role","range","divergent selection","nonhuman mammals","previous reports","transcription factor","orthologues","variation","respect","prey capture","Observations","emergence of language","mammal species","vocalisation","mutations"],"language":"en"},

Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will therefore be vital in curtailing disease spread. However, the most comprehensive assessments of the literature to date recognize the generally poor quality of evidence on which to base non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions. In light of the need to prepare for a possible pandemic despite concerns about the poor quality of the literature, combining available evidence with expert opinion about the relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza may lead to a more informed and widely accepted set of recommendations. We evaluated the evidence base for non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. Then, based on the collective evidence, we identified a set of recommendations for and against interventions that are specific to both the setting in which an intervention may be used and the pandemic phase, and which can be used by policymakers to prepare for a pandemic until scientific evidence can definitively respond to planners\u0027 needs. METHODS: Building on reviews of past pandemics and recent historical inquiries, we evaluated the relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions by combining available evidence from the literature with qualitative and quantitative expert opinion. Specifically, we reviewed the recent scientific literature regarding the prevention of human-to-human transmission of pandemic influenza, convened a meeting of experts from multiple disciplines, and elicited expert recommendation about the use of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in a variety of settings (healthcare facilities; community-based institutions; private households) and pandemic phases (no pandemic; no US pandemic; early localized US pandemic; advanced US pandemic). RESULTS: The literature contained a dearth of evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness of most non-pharmaceutical interventions for influenza. In an effort to inform decision-making in the absence of strong scientific evidence, the experts ultimately endorsed hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, surveillance and case reporting, and rapid viral diagnosis in all settings and during all pandemic phases. They also encouraged patient and provider use of masks and other personal protective equipment as well as voluntary self-isolation of patients during all pandemic phases. Other non-pharmaceutical interventions including mask-use and other personal protective equipment for the general public, school and workplace closures early in an epidemic, and mandatory travel restrictions were rejected as likely to be ineffective, infeasible, or unacceptable to the public. CONCLUSION: The demand for scientific evidence on non-pharmaceutical public health interventions for influenza is pervasive, and present policy recommendations must rely heavily on expert judgment. In the absence of a definitive science base, our assessment of the evidence identified areas for further investigation as well as non-pharmaceutical public health interventions that experts believe are likely to be beneficial, feasible and widely acceptable in an influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aledort, Julia E; Lurie, Nicole; Wasserman, Jeffrey; Bozzette, Samuel A","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89cc8249f1595458ab949c3e6fad98dbb19a40d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2040158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2040158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","pandemic phases","possible pandemic","use of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions","non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions","relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions","evidence base","localized US pandemic","advanced US pandemic","available evidence","human transmission of pandemic influenza","dearth of evidence","collective evidence","poor quality of evidence","absence of strong scientific evidence","general public","recent scientific literature","expert judgment","quantitative expert opinion","meeting of experts","personal protective equipment","elicited expert recommendation","effectiveness","accepted set of recommendations","provider use of masks","present policy recommendations","definitive science base","variety of settings","prevention of human","community-based institutions","recent historical inquiries","case reporting","surveillance","respiratory etiquette","reviews of past pandemics","healthcare facilities","multiple disciplines","private households","voluntary self-isolation of patients","hand hygiene","rapid viral diagnosis","epidemic","workplace closures","school","date","benefit of vaccines","efficacy","demand","investigation","antiviral medications","Building","limitations","mandatory travel restrictions","decision-making","concerns","curtailing disease spread","METHODS","comprehensive assessments","areas","CONCLUSION","planners\u0027 needs","supplies","effort","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","light","policymakers"],"language":"en"},

It is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used, and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based Comparative Genome Sequencing service provided by Nimblegen Systems Inc., we resequenced the E. coli strain W3110 Kohara using MG1655 as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods. CGS detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences, one large deletion, and 9 of 12 IS element insertions present in W3110, but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion. In addition, we confirmed that CGS also detected 2 SNPs, one deletion and 7 IS element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the W3110 lambda clone library. The false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244 Kb of genome sequence. CONCLUSION: CGS is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another, and while highly cost-effective, is prone to certain errors. Mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected. It is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which SNPs were not called because they often indicate deletions or IS element insertions.","publish_time":"2007-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herring, Christopher D; Palsson, Bernhard \u00D8","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4f8fcc4360079a02215dd83c280e4ff2b2363be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2072959.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["Comparative Genome Sequencing","Nimblegen Systems Inc.","CGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome sequence","element insertions present","CGS","SNPs","accuracy of genome resequencing","multiple mutations present","Comparative Genome Sequencing service","large deletion","small sequence differences","coli strain W3110 Kohara","W3110 lambda clone library","repeated sequences","bacterium relative","traditional sequencing methods","large chromosomal inversion","microarray","effective way","MG1655","high degree of secondary structure","Nimblegen Systems","creation","development of new technology","certain errors","false positive rate","reference","CONCLUSION","order","experimental manipulation","BACKGROUND","technique","confidence","regions","deletions","RESULTS","addition"],"language":"en"},

The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies.

Typically this involves two components: (i) Using time series methods to model the baseline background distribution (the time series process that is assumed to contain no outbreak signatures), (ii) Detecting outbreak signatures using filter-based time series methods. METHODS: We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children\u0027s emergency departments. These models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series, as well as time series dependencies on daily and weekly seasonal scales. Respiratory-related outbreak signature detection is based on filtering the one-step-ahead prediction errors obtained from the time series models for the respiratory-complaint background. RESULTS: Using simulation experiments based on a stochastic model for an anthrax attack, we illustrate the effect of the choice of filter and the statistical models upon radiograph-attributed outbreak signature detection. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the importance of using seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models (SARIMA) with covariates in the modeling of respiratory-related time series data. We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory-complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied. Our simulations show that the balance between specificity, sensitivity, and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter. The linear and exponential filters provide a good balance.","publish_time":"2007-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Craigmile, Peter F; Kim, Namhee; Fernandez, Soledad A; Bonsu, Bema K","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/139b81bc9c99d76cffc2014c4851942d2f592950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2203979.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2203979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Midwest"],"keyphrases":["time series dependencies","time series process","related time series data","filter-based time series methods","seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models","Respiratory-related outbreak signature detection","statistical models","smoothed ambient temperature series","disease outbreak signatures","modeling of respiratory","radiograph-attributed outbreak signature detection","respiratory-complaint backgrounds","varying respiratory-related diagnostic","choice of filter","Midwest emergency departments","chest radiograph data","Midwest children\u0027s emergency departments","syndromic data sources","baseline background distribution","anthrax attacks","good balance","stochastic model","weekly seasonal scales","patient visit","SARIMA","importance","available covariate information","covariates","step-ahead prediction errors","specificity","simulation experiments","exponential filters","effect","timeliness","influenza outbreaks","sensitivity","homogeneity","RESULTS","simulations","CONCLUSION","components"],"language":"en"},

One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response. CONCLUSION: In the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an SV40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis-induced ARDS. These vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type II cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool.","publish_time":"2007-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eid, Luminita; Bromberg, Zohar; EL-Latif, Mahmoud Abd; Zeira, Evelyn; Oppenheim, Ariella; Weiss, Yoram G","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6338a6003446f87e273e5e6faea242b49e094891.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2238754.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238754/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Luc"],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","ARDS","PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sepsis-induced ARDS","gene expression","SV40 vectors","sepsis induction","alveolar cells","vector presence","Vector abundance","Luc expression","luciferase reporter gene","light detection","CLP rats","Luc transduction","luciferase mRNA detection","transduction of alveolar type","SV40 VP1 capsid protein","immunoassay","pulmonary gene therapy","lung tissue","immunostaining","septic rats","RESULTS","significant cellular immune response","surfactant protein C","double staining","proSP-C","potential therapeutic modality","future therapeutic tool","cecal ligation double puncture","RT-PCR","adenovirus","alteration","efficient uptake","leading cause of death","lungs of animals","intratracheal PBS","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","simian virus","present study","capable of","distribution","ill patients","feasibility","Organ damage","BACKGROUND","METHODS","T-lymphocytes","primary organs","CONCLUSION","work","controls"],"language":"en"},

When an AMA1 vaccine was tested in a malaria na\u00EFve population, it induced functionally active antibodies judged by Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA). However, the same vaccine failed to induce higher growth-inhibitory activity in adults living in a malaria endemic area. Vaccination did induce functionally active antibodies in malaria-exposed children with less than 20% inhibition in GIA at baseline, but not in children with more than that level of baseline inhibition. METHODS: Total IgGs were purified from plasmas collected from the pediatric trial before and after immunization and pools of total IgGs were made. Another set of total IgGs was purified from U.S. adults immunized with AMA1 (US-total IgG). From these total IgGs, AMA1-specific and non-AMA1 IgGs were affinity purified and the functional activity of these IgGs was evaluated by GIA. Competition ELISA was performed with the U.S.-total IgG and non-AMA1 IgGs from malaria-exposed children. RESULTS: AMA1-specific IgGs from malaria-exposed children and U.S. vaccinees showed similar growth-inhibitory activity at the same concentrations. When mixed with U.S.-total IgG, non-AMA1 IgGs from children showed an interference effect in GIA. Interestingly, the interference effect was higher with non-AMA1 IgGs from higher titer pools. The non-AMA1 IgGs did not compete with anti-AMA1 antibody in U.S.-total IgG in the competition ELISA. CONCLUSION: Children living in a malaria endemic area have a fraction of IgGs that interferes with the biological activity of anti-AMA1 antibody as judged by GIA. While the mechanism of interference is not resolved in this study, these results suggest it is not caused by direct competition between non-AMA1 IgG and AMA1 protein. This study indicates that anti-malaria IgGs induced by natural exposure may interfere with the biological effect of antibody induced by an AMA1-based vaccine in the target population.","publish_time":"2011-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miura, Kazutoyo; Perera, Suwani; Brockley, Sarah; Zhou, Hong; Aebig, Joan A.; Moretz, Samuel E.; Miller, Louis H.; Doumbo, Ogobara K.; Sagara, Issaka; Dicko, Alassane; Ellis, Ruth D.; Long, Carole A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4481ddf0d81e186b0be8ab48c20e8b206ec2879c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3113848.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ELISA"],"organizations":["Growth Inhibition Assay","GIA"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["AMA1 vaccine","non-AMA1 IgG","AMA1-specific","AMA1 protein","AMA1-based vaccine","malaria-exposed children","anti-malaria","biological activity of anti-AMA1 antibody","pools of total","GIA","US-total IgG","set of total","malaria endemic area","malaria na\u00EFve population","higher growth-inhibitory activity","blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates","interference effect","biological effect of antibody","similar growth-inhibitory activity","functional activity","Competition ELISA","Growth Inhibition Assay","active antibodies","adults","higher titer pools","direct competition","level of baseline inhibition","mechanism of interference","study","RESULTS","target population","vaccinees","affinity","natural exposure","Apical membrane antigen","immunization","best","pediatric trial","BACKGROUND","plasmas","fraction","Vaccination","concentrations","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Several virus families in the order Nidovirales, such as the coronaviruses (CoVs) must achieve these objectives with the largest and most complex replicating RNA genomes known, up to 32 kb of positive-sense RNA. The CoVs encode sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp 1\u201316) with known or predicted RNA synthesis and modification activities, and it has been proposed that they are also responsible for the evolution of large genomes. The CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, encode a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN) in nsp14. Genetic inactivation of ExoN activity in engineered SARS-CoV and MHV genomes by alanine substitution at conserved DE-D-D active site residues results in viable mutants that demonstrate 15- to 20-fold increases in mutation rates, up to 18 times greater than those tolerated for fidelity mutants of other RNA viruses. Thus nsp14-ExoN is essential for replication fidelity, and likely serves either as a direct mediator or regulator of a more complex RNA proofreading machine, a process previously unprecedented in RNA virus biology. Elucidation of the mechanisms of nsp14-mediated proofreading will have major implications for our understanding of the evolution of RNA viruses, and also will provide a robust model to investigate the balance between fidelity, diversity and pathogenesis. The discovery of a protein distinct from a viral RdRp that regulates replication fidelity also raises the possibility that RNA genome replication fidelity may be adaptable to differing replication environments and selective pressures, rather than being a fixed determinant.","publish_time":"2011-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denison, Mark R; Graham, Rachel L; Donaldson, Eric F; Eckerle, Lance D; Baric, Ralph S","journal":"RNA Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62d492ab87d2e579711013573e9929e0064c55f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3127101.xml.json","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/rna.8.2.15013?needAccess=true","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA genome replication fidelity","evolution of RNA viruses","RNA virus biology","complex replicating RNA genomes","predicted RNA synthesis","positive-sense RNA","fidelity mutants","complex RNA proofreading machine","replication environments","nsp14-ExoN","CoVs","replication competent genome","MHV genomes","balance","evolution of large genomes","mechanisms of nsp14","virus families","Genetic inactivation of ExoN activity","engineered SARS-CoV","murine hepatitis virus","mediated proofreading","viable mutants","exoribonuclease activity","order Nidovirales","conserved DE-D-D active site residues results","process","alanine substitution","new environmental conditions","adaptation","host cells","possibility","capacity","need","major implications","viral RdRp","regulator","understanding","mutation rates","modification activities","protein distinct","selective pressures","times greater","fold increases","nonstructural proteins","coronaviruses","objectives","diversity","pathogenesis","direct mediator","robust model","discovery","Elucidation","fixed determinant"],"language":"en"},

CASE PRESENTATION: A 2 1/2 years old girl was diagnosed as having alveolar proteinosis. Whole lung lavages were performed with a new catheter balloon technique, feasible in small sized airways. Because of some interstitial inflammation in the lung biopsy and to further improve the condition, empirical therapy with systemic steroids and azathioprin, and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF, were used. Based on clinical measures, total protein and lipid recovered by whole lung lavages, all these treatments were without benefit. Conversely, severe respiratory viral infections and an invasive aspergillosis with aspergilloma formation occurred. Recently the novel homozygous stop mutation p.Ser25X of the GMCSF receptor alpha chain was identified in the patient. This mutation leads to a lack of functional GMCSF receptor and a reduced response to GMCSF stimulation of CD11b expression of mononuclear cells of the patient. Subsequently a very intense treatment with monthly lavages was initiated, resulting for the first time in complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency and a significant improvement of the overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child. CONCLUSIONS: The long term management from early childhood into young adolescence of severe alveolar proteinosis due to GMCSF receptor deficiency requires a dedicated specialized team to perform technically demanding whole lung lavages and cope with complications.","publish_time":"2011-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griese, Matthias; Ripper, Jan; Sibbersen, Anke; Lohse, Pia; Lohse, Peter; Brasch, Frank; Schams, Andrea; Pamir, Asli; Schaub, Bianca; Muensterer, Oliver J; Sch\u00F6n, Carola; Gl\u00F6ckner-Pagel, Judith; Nicolai, Thomas; Reiter, Karl; Hector, Andreas","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8be183b59a7ccf2598c301d4c465f559d11ad80a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3175167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GMCSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung lavages","GMCSF receptor deficiency","subcutaneous GMCSF","GMCSF receptor alpha chain","lack of functional GMCSF receptor","lung biopsy","monthly lavages","young adolescence of severe alveolar proteinosis","congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis","GM-CSF receptor","Clinical presentation","patient","GMCSF stimulation of CD11b expression of mononuclear cells","severe respiratory viral infections","clinical measures","CASE PRESENTATION","long term management","overall somato-psychosocial condition","complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency","novel homozygous stop mutation p","Ser25X","early childhood","reduced response","significant improvement","invasive aspergillosis","new catheter balloon technique","azathioprin","outcome","lipid","small sized airways","empirical therapy","systemic steroids","diagnosis","PAP","mutations","dedicated specialized team","total protein","time","years old girl","aspergilloma formation","CONCLUSIONS","intense treatment","interstitial inflammation","BACKGROUND","treatments","cope","complications","benefit"],"language":"en"},

Surgical lung biopsy may rule out other diagnoses, but has not been generally useful for therapy decisions or prognosis in this setting. Importantly, tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia, the hallmarks of steroid-responsive acute eosinophilic pneumonia, are not commonly linked with ALI. We hypothesized that occult eosinophilic pneumonia may explain better outcomes for some patients with ALI. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody recognizing eosinophil peroxidase (EPX-mAb) was used to assess intrapulmonary eosinophil accumulation/degranulation. Lung biopsies from ALI patients (n = 20) were identified following review of a pathology database; 45% of which (i.e., 9/20) displayed classical diffuse alveolar damage (ALI-DAD). Controls were obtained from uninvolved tissue in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer (n = 10). Serial biopsy sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) and subjected to EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry provided a \u003E40-fold increased sensitivity to detect eosinophils in the lung relative to H\u0026E stained sections. This increased sensitivity led to the identification of higher numbers of eosinophils in ALI patients compared with controls; differences using H\u0026E staining alone were not significant. Clinical assessments showed that lung infiltrating eosinophil numbers were higher in ALI patients that survived hospitalization compared with non-survivors. A similar conclusion was reached quantifying eosinophil degranulation in each biopsy. CONCLUSION: The enhanced sensitivity of EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry uniquely identified eosinophil accumulation/degranulation in patients with ALI relative to controls. More importantly, this method was a prognostic indicator of patient survival. These observations suggest that EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry may represent a diagnostic biomarker identifying a subset of ALI patients with improved clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2011-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willetts, Lian; Parker, Kimberly; Wesselius, Lewis J; Protheroe, Cheryl A; Jaben, Elizabeth; Graziano, P; Moqbel, Redwan; Leslie, Kevin O; Lee, Nancy A; Lee, James J","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d585c2dfbb6159fd5954e1ddc884e99ab3614847.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3176486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3176486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozgw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subset of ALI patients","ALI relative","ALI-DAD","EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry","lung relative","eosinophil numbers","lung cancer","Lung biopsies","Surgical lung biopsy","eosinophil peroxidase","quantifying eosinophil degranulation","Acute lung injury","enhanced sensitivity of EPX","Controls","intrapulmonary eosinophil accumulation","increased sensitivity","E stained sections","E staining","Serial biopsy sections","identification of higher numbers of eosinophils","responsive acute eosinophilic pneumonia","improved clinical outcomes","better outcomes","therapy decisions","uninvolved tissue","Clinical assessments","similar conclusion","hallmarks of steroid","novel monoclonal antibody","hematoxylin","lobectomy","differences","diagnostic biomarker","hospitalization","classical diffuse alveolar damage","peripheral blood eosinophilia","serious respiratory disorder","prognosis","prognostic indicator of patient survival","BACKGROUND","following review","pathology database","setting","METHODS","RESULTS","observations","non-survivors","infection","diagnoses"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed.

The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of redox chaperones is closely involved in both processes and is also implicated in protein unfolding and trafficking across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and towards the cytosol, a thiol-based redox locus for antigen processing. Here, we summarise examples of the cellular association of host PDI with different pathogens and explore the possible roles of pathogen PDIs in infection.

In our cases all the signs and symptoms, including vomiting, progressive respiratory disease leading to respiratory failure, refractory hypoxemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and hepatic aminotransferases, were consistent with critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 virus infection. Other infectious disorders may mimic H1N1 viral infection especially Legionnaires\u0027 disease. Because the swine flu H1N1 pandemic occurred in Autumn in Italy, Legionnaires disease was to be highly suspected since the peak incidence usually occurs in early fall.

The present review focused on the effectiveness of NPPV in children \u003E 1 month of age with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. ARF is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children. Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment of pediatric patients with pending respiratory failure can be lifesaving. Mechanical respiratory support is a critical intervention in many cases of ARF. In recent years, NPPV has been proposed as a valuable alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in this acute setting. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of NPPV in children with ARF. Several pediatric clinical studies, the majority of which were noncontrolled or case series and of small size, have suggested the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of ARF due to acute airway (upper or lower) obstruction or certain primary parenchymal lung disease, and in specific circumstances, such as postoperative or postextubation ARF, immunocompromised patients with ARF, or as a means to facilitate extubation. NPPV was well tolerated with rare major complications and was associated with improved gas exchange, decreased work of breathing, and ETI avoidance in 22-100% of patients. High FiO(2 )needs or high PaCO(2 )level on admission or within the first hours after starting NPPV appeared to be the best independent predictive factors for the NPPV failure in children with ARF. However, many important issues, such as the identification of the patient, the right time for NPPV application, and the appropriate setting, are still lacking. Further randomized, controlled trials that address these issues in children with ARF are recommended.","publish_time":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Najaf-Zadeh, Abolfazl; Leclerc, Francis","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e1cd080ae36fd6b062271c7abe4dea3686cec59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3224494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3224494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPPV","ARF","ETI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NPPV failure","effectiveness of NPPV","treatment of ARF","NPPV application","postextubation ARF","children","cases of ARF","beneficial effects of NPPV","acute respiratory failure","pending respiratory failure","delivery of mechanical respiratory support","acute setting","treatment of pediatric patients","acute airway","invasive mechanical ventilation","immunocompromised patients","pediatric clinical studies","Recent physiological studies","ETI avoidance","important issues","recent years","appropriate setting","high PaCO","High FiO","Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation","obstruction","certain primary parenchymal lung disease","decreased work of breathing","IMV","critical intervention","improved gas exchange","month of age","best independent predictive factors","specific circumstances","use of endotracheal intubation","valuable alternative","right time","common cause of cardiac arrest","identification","small size","majority","prompt recognition","rare major complications","case series","admission","level","lifesaving","controlled trials","present review","different conditions","means","hours"],"language":"en"},

Influenza viruses are believed to be transmitted as cell-free virus from infected cells to uninfected cells. Here, we demonstrated that influenza virus can utilize cell-to-cell transmission pathway through apical membranes, by handover of virions on the surface of an infected cell to adjacent host cells. Live cell imaging techniques showed that a recombinant influenza virus, in which the neuraminidase gene was replaced with the green fluorescence protein gene, spreads from an infected cell to adjacent cells forming infected cell clusters. This type of virus spreading requires HA activation by protease treatment. The cell-to-cell transmission was also blocked by amantadine, which inhibits the acidification of endosomes required for uncoating of influenza virus particles in endosomes, indicating that functional hemagglutinin and endosome acidification by M2 ion channel were essential for the cell-to-cell influenza virus transmission. Furthermore, in the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus, progeny virions could remain associated with the surface of infected cell even after budding, for the progeny virions to be passed on to adjacent uninfected cells. The evidence that cell-to-cell transmission occurs in influenza virus lead to the caution that local infection proceeds even when treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mori, Kotaro; Haruyama, Takahiro; Nagata, Kyosuke","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15228615c1656f39a5ec8dcc8bc26ef0371d4040.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3227662.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3227662/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell fusion","cell influenza virus transmission","cell transmission of influenza virus","cell-free virus","designated cell","neighboring cell","cell transmission pathway","surface of infected cell","infected cell clusters","influenza virus lead","recombinant influenza virus","virus diffusion","type of virus","Live cell imaging techniques","uncoating of influenza virus particles","Influenza viruses","adjacent cells","adjacent host cells","adjacent uninfected cells","host anti-virus defense systems","handover of virions","production of progeny virions","infection of viruses","acidification of endosomes","neuraminidase gene","viral infection","local infection","endosome acidification","neuraminidase inhibitors","green fluorescence protein gene","spreads","M2 ion channel","functional hemagglutinin","terms of evasion","apical membranes","syncytium","HA activation","caution","door","protease treatment","pathways","amantadine","evidence"],"language":"en"},

It can be transmitted by mosquitoes, inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids of infected animals. Severe clinical cases are characterized by acute hepatitis with hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis and/or retinitis. The dynamics of RVFV infection and the cell types infected in vivo are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RVFV strains expressing humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and inoculated to susceptible Ifnar1-deficient mice. We investigated the tissue tropism in these mice and the nature of the target cells in vivo using whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry. After intraperitoneal inoculation, hRLuc signal was observed primarily in the thymus, spleen and liver. Macrophages infiltrating various tissues, in particular the adipose tissue surrounding the pancreas also expressed the virus. The liver rapidly turned into the major luminescent organ and the mice succumbed to severe hepatitis. The brain remained weakly luminescent throughout infection. FACS analysis in RVFV-GFP-infected mice showed that the macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes were main target cells for RVFV. The crucial role of cells of the monocyte/macrophage/dendritic lineage during RVFV infection was confirmed by the slower viral dissemination, decrease in RVFV titers in blood, and prolonged survival of macrophage- and dendritic cell-depleted mice following treatment with clodronate liposomes. Upon dermal and nasal inoculations, the viral dissemination was primarily observed in the lymph node draining the injected ear and in the lungs respectively, with a significant increase in survival time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal the high levels of phagocytic cells harboring RVFV during viral infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice. They demonstrate that bioluminescent and fluorescent viruses can shed new light into the pathogenesis of RVFV infection.","publish_time":"2011-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gommet, C\u00E9line; Billecocq, Agn\u00E8s; Jouvion, Gr\u00E9gory; Hasan, Milena; Zaverucha do Valle, T\u00E2nia; Guillemot, Laurent; Blanchet, Charl\u00E8ne; van Rooijen, Nico; Montagutelli, Xavier; Bouloy, Mich\u00E8le; Panthier, Jean-Jacques","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f18afbc0a4621e7f13dcfbc67c85bf8dfe3b30ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3232203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV","Renilla","FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV-GFP","RVFV strains","RVFV titers","pathogenesis of RVFV infection","dynamics of RVFV infection","infected mice","dendritic cells","viral infection","dendritic cell-depleted mice","susceptible Ifnar1-deficient mice","main target cells","crucial role of cells","dendritic lineage","high levels of phagocytic cells","slower viral dissemination","Macrophages","severe hepatitis","liver","prolonged survival of macrophage","major luminescent organ","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","hRLuc signal","fluorescent viruses","acute hepatitis","organ imaging","cell types","survival time","body fluids of infected animals","adipose tissue","tissue tropism","green fluorescent protein","Severe clinical cases","Rift Valley fever virus","humanized Renilla luciferase","granulocytes","new light","monocyte","treatment","physical contact","disease","blood","various tissues","injected ear","lungs","inhalation","significant increase","hemorrhage","meningoencephalitis","BACKGROUND","pancreas","clodronate liposomes","nasal inoculations","METHODOLOGY","nature","lymph node","FACS analysis","mosquitoes","thymus","intraperitoneal inoculation","flow cytometry","SIGNIFICANCE","livestock","brain","retinitis","humans","spleen","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This research utilizes traditional Chinese medicine Database@Taiwan (TCM Database@Taiwan) to screen for compounds that simultaneously target H1 and N1 to overcome current difficulties with virus mutations. The top three candidates were de novo derivatives of xylopine and rosmaricine. Bioactivity of the de novo derivatives against N1 were validated by multiple machine learning prediction models. Ability of the de novo compounds to maintain CoMFA/CoMSIA contour and form key interactions implied bioactivity within H1 as well. Addition of a pyridinium fragment was critical to form stable interactions in H1 and N1 as supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results from MD, hydrophobic interactions, and torsion angles are consistent and support the findings of docking. Multiple anchors and lack of binding to residues prone to mutation suggest that the TCM de novo derivatives may be resistant to drug resistance and are advantageous over conventional H1N1 treatments such as oseltamivir.

For over two decades, it has been widely accepted that the 10 segments of the dsRNA genome of BTV encode for 7 structural and 3 non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3/NS3a) play different key roles during the viral replication cycle. In this study we show that BTV expresses a fourth non-structural protein (that we designated NS4) encoded by an open reading frame in segment 9 overlapping the open reading frame encoding VP6. NS4 is 77\u201379 amino acid residues in length and highly conserved among several BTV serotypes/strains. NS4 was expressed early post-infection and localized in the nucleoli of BTV infected cells. By reverse genetics, we showed that NS4 is dispensable for BTV replication in vitro, both in mammalian and insect cells, and does not affect viral virulence in murine models of bluetongue infection. Interestingly, NS4 conferred a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not to BTV-1, in cells in an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. However, the BTV-1 NS4 conferred a replication advantage both to a BTV-8 reassortant containing the entire segment 9 of BTV-1 and to a BTV-8 mutant with the NS4 identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein. Collectively, this study suggests that NS4 plays an important role in virus-host interaction and is one of the mechanisms played, at least by BTV-8, to counteract the antiviral response of the host. In addition, the distinct nucleolar localization of NS4, being expressed by a virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, offers new avenues to investigate the multiple roles played by the nucleolus in the biology of the cell.","publish_time":"2011-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratinier, Maxime; Caporale, Marco; Golder, Matthew; Franzoni, Giulia; Allan, Kathryn; Nunes, Sandro Filipe; Armezzani, Alessia; Bayoumy, Amr; Rixon, Frazer; Shaw, Andrew; Palmarini, Massimo","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc9a6a00498ee4dfeaf7c201c3341aca6ad21409.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3248566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BTV replication","homologous BTV","BTV serotypes","dsRNA genome of BTV","NS4 identical","nucleoli of BTV infected cells","distinct nucleolar localization of NS4","replication advantage","Bluetongue virus","non-structural proteins","viral replication cycle","open reading frame","virus-host interaction","insect cells","study","murine models of bluetongue infection","viral virulence","multiple roles","entire segment","antiviral state","antiviral response","different key roles","early post-infection","NS3a","important role","NS1","NS2","length","causative agent","major disease of livestock","amino acid residues","nucleolus","new avenues","IFN","mammalian","addition","cytoplasm","interferon","segments","strains","VP6","reassortant","mutant","biology","reverse genetics","mechanisms","decades"],"language":"en"},

Here we show, using electrophysiology, fluorescence, biochemistry, and X-ray crystallography, that the mechanism for this controlled assembly is the formation of a parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domain of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper region of CNGA1 subunits, constraining the channel to contain three CNGA1 subunits, followed by preferential incorporation of a single CNGB1 subunit. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper domain relaxed the constraint and permitted multiple CNGB1 subunits in the channel. The X-ray crystal structures of the parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domains of CNGA1 and CNGA3 subunits were similar, suggesting that a similar mechanism controls the stoichiometry of cone CNG channels.

Passengers seated on the same row, two rows in front or behind a patient infectious for influenza, during a flight of \u2265 4 h were considered close contacts. This study evaluates the timeliness of flight-contact tracing (CT) as performed following national and international CT requests addressed to the Center of Infectious Disease Control (CIb/RIVM), and implemented by the Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport. METHODS: Elapsed days between date of flight arrival and the date passenger lists became available (contact details identified - CI) was used as proxy for timeliness of CT. In a retrospective study, dates of flight arrival, onset of illness, laboratory diagnosis, CT request and identification of contacts details through passenger lists, following CT requests to the RIVM for flights landed at Schiphol Airport were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 24 requests for CT were identified. Three of these were declined as over 4 days had elapsed since flight arrival. In 17 out of 21 requests, contact details were obtained within 7 days after arrival (81%). The average delay between arrival and CI was 3,9 days (range 2-7), mainly caused by delay in diagnosis of the index patient after arrival (2,6 days). In four flights (19%), contacts were not identified or only after \u003E 7 days. CI involving Dutch airlines was faster than non-Dutch airlines (P \u003C 0,05). Passenger locator cards did not improve timeliness of CI. In only three flights contact details were identified within 2 days after arrival. CONCLUSION: CT for influenza A/H1N1 2009 among flight passengers was not successful for timely provision of prophylaxis. CT had little additional value for alerting passengers for disease symptoms, as this information already was provided during and after the flight. Public health authorities should take into account patient delays in seeking medical advise and laboratory confirmation in relation to maximum time to provide postexposure prophylaxis when deciding to install contact tracing measures. International standardization of CT guidelines is recommended.","publish_time":"2011-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swaan, Corien M; Appels, Rolf; Kretzschmar, Mirjam EE; van Steenbergen, Jim E","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8957d48b6bcf17b7b51e004d19314ce77f653a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3265549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CI","Municipal Health Services","CT","RIVM"],"locations":["Schiphol Airport"],"keyphrases":["date of flight arrival","flight passengers","dates of flight arrival","timeliness of flight","international CT requests","contact details","Elapsed days","timeliness of CI","International standardization of CT guidelines","identification of contacts details","flights","contact tracing measures","laboratory diagnosis","patient infectious","date passenger lists","close contacts of cases","disease symptoms","H1N1","signs of disease","early diagnosis","index patient","RIVM","postexposure prophylaxis","alerting passengers","antiviral prophylaxis","Center of Infectious Disease Control","non-Dutch airlines","account patient delays","Passenger locator cards","timely provision of prophylaxis","Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport","laboratory confirmation","initial containment phase of influenza","retrospective study","average delay","Public health authorities","onset of illness","relation","maximum time","additional value","CIb","BACKGROUND","treatment","METHODS","rows","information","proxy","CONCLUSION","range","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Severity assessment scores partially address the difficulties in identifying high-risk patients. A lack of specific and valid pathophysiologic severity markers affect early and effective sepsis therapy. HMGB-1, sRAGE and RAGE have been involved in sepsis and their potential as severity markers has been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate HMGB-1, RAGE and sRAGE levels in patients with CAP-associated sepsis and determine their possible association with clinical outcome. METHOD: We evaluated 33 patients with CAP-associated sepsis admitted to the emergency room and followed in the medical wards. Severity assessment scores (CURB-65, PSI, APACHE II, SOFA) and serologic markers (HMGB-1, RAGE, sRAGE) were evaluated on admission. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of CAP-associated sepsis were enrolled in the study within 24 hours after admission. Fourteen (46.6%) had pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus, 2 (6.6%) had seasonal influenza A and 14 other diagnoses. Of the patients in the study group, 16 (53.3%) had a fatal outcome. ARDS was observed in 17 (56.6%) and a total of 22 patients had severe sepsis on admission (73%). The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and non-surviving groups (P = .003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P = .005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher in non-surviving (P = .058) and ARDS patients (P = .058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P = .013) and sRAGE (P = .05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: The association of elevated sRAGE with a fatal outcome suggests that it may have an independent causal effect in CAP. SOFA scores were the only clinical factor with the ability to identify surviving and ARDS patients.","publish_time":"2012-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narvaez-Rivera, Rodrigo M; Rendon, Adrian; Salinas-Carmona, Mario C; Rosas-Taraco, Adrian G","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05bbb228a1d50e89500669fec042d288d0796c6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3274434.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","SOFA","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS patients","high-risk patients","CAP-associated sepsis","sRAGE levels","SOFA scores","severe sepsis","fatal outcome","Severity assessment scores","association of elevated sRAGE","HMGB","clinical outcome","admission","effective sepsis therapy","diagnosis of CAP","non-surviving groups","valid pathophysiologic severity markers","serologic markers","study group","possible association","clinical factor","similar results","seasonal influenza","greatest difference","infectious disease","important cause of death","CURB","difficulties","lack of specific","emergency room","developed countries","APACHE","independent causal effect","Logistic regression modeling","pandemic","H1N1","virus","Community","pneumonia","probability","CONCLUSION","total","potential","medical wards","BACKGROUND","diagnoses","hours","variables","aim","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

Recently, other animals such as pigs and some species of fruit bats have also been shown to be susceptible to these viruses. While having a preference for some cell types such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, filoviruses are known to be pantropic in infection of primates. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that filovirus GP interacts with multiple molecules for entry into host cells, whereas none of the cellular molecules so far identified as a receptor/co-receptor fully explains filovirus tissue tropism and host range. Available data suggest that the mucin-like region (MLR) on GP plays an important role in attachment to the preferred target cells, whose infection is likely involved in filovirus pathogenesis, whereas the MLR is not essential for the fundamental function of the GP in viral entry into cells in vitro. Further studies elucidating the mechanisms of cellular entry of filoviruses may shed light on the development of strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers.","publish_time":"2012-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takada, Ayato","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c1a9a13829fc83999db461322319bda6c81530.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3277274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MLR"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["host cells","filovirus GP","endothelial cells","dendritic cells","preferred target cells","mechanisms of cellular entry of filoviruses","Marburg viruses","receptor binding","co-receptor","viral entry","MLR","host cell membrane","host range","filovirus pathogenesis","infection of primates","cellular molecules","Marburg hemorrhagic fevers","filovirus tissue tropism","non-human primates","treatment of Ebola","virus envelope","multiple molecules","cell types","envelope glycoprotein","cause severe hemorrhagic fever","attachment","hepatocytes","monocytes","development of strategies","prophylaxis","important role","fusion","fundamental function","light","pigs","mucin","macrophages","species of fruit bats","studies","region","Available data","animals","preference"],"language":"en"},

We further assessed some of the obtained results by in vitro and in vivo methods in a hamster model and in brain samples from NiV-infected patients. We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells. Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity. In NiV-infected hamsters, which develop pathology similar to what is seen in humans, expression of CXCL10 mRNA was induced in different organs with kinetics that followed NiV replication. Finally, we showed intense staining for CXCL10 in the brain of patients who succumbed to lethal NiV infection during the outbreak in Malaysia, confirming induction of this chemokine in fatal human infections.

Although the pandemic is now over, the virus has emerged as the predominant strain in the current seasonal influenza phase in the northern hemisphere. The A H1N1 influenza is a novel strain of the influenza A virus and is widely known as swine flu. The virus contains a mixture of genetic material from human, pig and bird flu virus. It is a new variety of flu which people have not had much immunity to. Much has been learnt from the Pandemic of 2009/2010 but the messages about vaccination and treatment seem to be taken slowly by the clinical profession. Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery. The median duration of illness is around seven days. This influenza typically affects the younger age group i.e. from the ages of 5\u201365 years. Current experience shows that the age group experiencing increased morbidity and mortality rates are in those under 65 years of age. Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters. In the United Kingdom, twelve maternal deaths were reported to be associated with the H1N1 virus during the pandemic and clear avoidable factors were identified (Modder, Review of Maternal Deaths in the UK related to A H1N1 2009 influenza (CMACE). www.cmace.org.uk, 2010). The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate (Yates et al. Health Technol Assess 14(34):109\u2013182, 2010). There continues to be a low uptake of the flu vaccine and commencement of antiviral treatment for pregnant women.","publish_time":"2011-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Boon H.; Mahmood, Tahir A.","journal":"J Obstet Gynaecol India","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f123a7e67feda5888aec0cc54810f73f5dfef31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3295877.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3295877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 virus","H1N1 influenza","H1N1 pandemic","bird flu virus","pregnant women","current seasonal influenza phase","flu vaccine","swine flu","years of age","younger age group","new variety of flu","people","perinatal mortality rate","Review of Maternal Deaths","threefold increase","fivefold increase","mortality rates","predominant strain","novel strain","Current experience","altered immunity","preterm delivery rate","commencement of antiviral treatment","mild viral illness","median duration of illness","human","Modder","pig","clear avoidable factors","higher risk","physiological adaptations","Yates","mixture of genetic material","increased morbidity","UK","Health Technol","northern hemisphere","low uptake","pulmonary complications","pregnancy outcomes","United Kingdom","messages","days","vaccination","CMACE","clinical profession","recovery","trimesters"],"language":"en"},

Our recent studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes limits immune detection and IFN-\u03B2 synthesis via deacetylation of its peptidoglycan, which renders the bacterium resistant to lysozyme degradation. Here, we examined signaling requirements for the massive IFN-\u03B2 production resulting from the infection of murine macrophages with a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes, \u0394pgdA, which is unable to modify its peptidoglycan. We report the identification of unconventional signaling pathways to the IFN-\u03B2 gene, requiring TLR2 and bacterial internalization. Induction of IFN-\u03B2 was independent of the Mal/TIRAP adaptor protein but required TRIF and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. These pathways were stimulated to a lesser degree by wild-type L. monocytogenes. They operated in both resident and inflammatory macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity, but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The novelty of our findings thus lies in the first description of TLR2 and TRIF as two critical components leading to the induction of the IFN-\u03B2 gene and in uncovering that individual macrophage populations adopt different strategies to link pathogen recognition signals to IFN-\u03B2 gene expression.","publish_time":"2012-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aubry, Camille; Corr, Sin\u00E9ad C.; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Goulard, C\u00E9line; Jones, Ruth; Jamieson, Amanda M.; Decker, Thomas; O\u0027Neill, Luke A.

We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975\u20132002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975\u20132002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = \u22120.61) and severity (r = \u22120.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.","publish_time":"2012-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, Robert E.; Rossier, Colleen E.; Enfield, Kyle B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87795a5783981250b35b32635c37fd2a098c4ed6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3314701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["influenza mortality","pneumonia mortality","normal mortality","daily air temperature","dry air","daily influenza","high mortality days","high mortality episodes","high mortality events","daily pneumonia","influenza variability","characteristics of longer mortality episodes","morning dew point temperature","daily air mass type","periods of low dew point temperature","moist polar air masses","low dew point temperatures","normal pneumonia","cold season","substantial winter influenza peak","lead time","New York City","New York metropolitan area","non-events","temperate climates","association","nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis","measure of atmospheric humidity","causal factor","surroundings","warning systems","retrospective study","infection","hypothesis","Weeks","contention","temporal smoothers","latency period","Unpaired t-tests","death","severity","research","relationship","effects","duration"],"language":"en"},

Using the Taiwan quarantine data, we found that the onset-to-diagnosis time of previously quarantined confirmed case-patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been quarantined. Thus, quarantine for SARS in Taiwan screened potentially infective persons for swift diagnosis and hospitalization after onset, thereby indirectly reducing infections. Full-scale quarantine measures implemented on April 28 led to a significant improvement in onset-to-diagnosis time of all SARS patients, regardless of previous quarantine status. We discuss the temporal effects of quarantine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential usefulness of quarantine in faster identification of persons with SARS and in improving isolation measures.","publish_time":"2005-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; King, Chwan-Chuan; Chen, Cathy W.

The aim was to provide health authorities in New Zealand with evidence-based practical information to guide the development and delivery of effective health messages for H1N1 and other health campaigns. This study contributed to the initiative by providing qualitative data about community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behavioural change and the differential impact on vulnerable groups in New Zealand. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected on community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 Ministry of Health H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behaviour and the differential impact on vulnerable groups. Eight focus groups were held in the winter of 2010 with 80 participants from groups identified by the Ministry of Health as vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, such as people with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, children, Pacific Peoples and M\u0101ori. Because this study was part of a rapid response initiative, focus groups were selected as the most efficient means of data collection in the time available. For M\u0101ori, focus group discussion (hui) is a culturally appropriate methodology. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of data identified four major themes: personal and community risk, building community strategies, responsibility and information sources. People wanted messages about specific actions that they could take to protect themselves and their families and to mitigate any consequences. They wanted transparent and factual communication where both good and bad news is conveyed by people who they could trust. CONCLUSIONS: The responses from all groups endorsed the need for community based risk management including information dissemination. Engaging with communities will be essential to facilitate preparedness and build community resilience to future pandemic events. This research provides an illustration of the complexities of how people understand and respond to health messages related to the H1N1 pandemic. The importance of the differences identified in the analysis is not the differences per se but highlight problems with a \u0022one size fits all\u0022 pandemic warning strategy.","publish_time":"2012-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gray, Lesley; MacDonald, Carol; Mackie, Brenda; Paton, Douglas; Johnston, David; Baker, Michael G","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0df9700dcbadaf4aa0c3a8ae877f992467f74701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3324376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3324376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Ministry of Health"],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["health campaigns","key health messages","health authorities","impact of messages","Ministry of Health H1N1 campaigns","delivery of effective health messages","community responses","vulnerable groups","H1N1 pandemic","focus groups","chronic health conditions","Health Research Council of New Zealand","community risk","community strategies","community resilience","differential impact","qualitative data","H1N1 virus","community based risk management","Thematic analysis of data","contestable rapid response initiative","practical information","information dissemination","information sources","future pandemic events","pandemic warning strategy","M\u0101ori","differences","study","efficient means of data collection","pregnant women","children","major themes","development","evidence","need","behavioural change","hui","Pacific Peoples","size fits","preparedness","responsibility","factual communication","bad news","problems","time available","group discussion","RESULTS","illustration","complexities","winter","participants","specific actions","influenza","appropriate methodology","communities","aim","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","families","consequences","importance","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Positing that improved USPIO with a higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would yield better plaque images, we performed MRI and histologic studies to compare the uptake of dextran- and mannan\u2013dextran-coated USPIO (D-USPIO and DM-USPIO, respectively) by the atherosclerotic walls of rabbits. We intravenously injected atherosclerotic rabbits with DM-USPIO (n = 5) or D-USPIO (n = 5). Two rabbits were the controls. The doses delivered were 0.08 (dose 1) (n = 1), 0.4 (dose 2) (n = 1), or 0.8 (dose 3) (n = 3) mmol iron/Kg. The dose 3 rabbits underwent in vivo contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before and 5 days after USPIO administration. Afterwards, all animals were euthanized, the aortae were removed and subjected to in vitro MRI study. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the aortic wall in the same region of interest (ROI) was calculated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Histological assessment through measurement of iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens showed that iron-positive regions were significantly larger in rabbits injected with DM- rather than D-USPIO (P \u003C 0.05) for all doses. In vivo MRA showed that the SNR-reducing effect of DM- was greater than that of D-USPIO (P \u003C 0.05). With in vitro MRI scans, SNR was significantly lower in rabbits treated with dose 2 of DM-USPIO compared with D-USPIO treatment (P \u003C 0.05), and it tended to be lower at dose 3 (P \u003C 0.1).

Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into \u2018attribute groups\u2019 based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use. 2.. Non\u2010hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature\u2010 and field\u2010derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life\u2010history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable. 3.. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids). 4.. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes. 5.. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and (b) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade\u2010offs between resistance and resilience traits, \u2018functional plasticity\u2019 in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed. 6.. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P \u003C 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free\u2010floating surface or free\u2010floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation. 7.. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade\u2010off between resistance\u2010type traits (related to stream lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free\u2010floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.","publish_time":"2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willby, Nigel J.; Abernethy, Vicky J.; Demars, Beno\u00EEt O.

Methods: In this study, we examined nasal immune responses in the first 2 years of life in relation to age of children and the number of viral infections they have experienced. Nasal brushes were taken during rhinovirus\u2010 (n = 20) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u2010induced (n = 7) upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and of controls (n = 40). Results: The number of macrophages were higher during URTI and increased with age. The number of T lymphocytes increased with age in controls and were higher during URTI at all ages. We found an age\u2010related decrease in the number of interleukin (IL)\u20104\u2010 and IL\u201010\u2010positive cells in controls, while the number of IL\u201012\u2010positive cells remained unchanged.

Conclusions: In infants, we found an infection\u2010 and age\u2010related increase respectively for nasal macrophages and T lymphocytes during URTI. Furthermore, the number of IL\u20104\u2010 and IL\u201010\u2010positive cells decreased with age.

Using in vitro and in vivo experimental models the role of various proinflammatory or anti\u2010inflammatory mediators, antiviral responses and molecular pathways that lead from infection to symptoms has been partly unravelled. In particular, mechanisms of susceptibility to viral infection have been identified and the bronchial epithelium appeared to be a key player. Nevertheless, additional understanding of the integration between the diverse elements of the antiviral response, especially in the context of allergic airway inflammation, as well as the interactions between viral infections and other stimuli that affect airway inflammation and responsiveness may lead to novel strategies in treating and/or preventing asthma exacerbations.

Potential mechanisms for viral induced demyelination include persistent infection of host tissues or immune mediated organ damage either in the presence or absence of the infectious agent. Any proposed viral candidate should cause demyelination in animals or man and the pattern of infection should be consistent with the unique geographic features of MS epidemiology. In addition, serologic studies should support an infection by the agent and/or viral genome should be detected in MS tissues.

We often calculate the proportion of time spent eating different foods (e.g., fruits, leaves) to place species into dietary categories and contrast morphological or behavioral traits among categories. Yet we have little understanding of how flexible species can be in terms of the plant parts and species consumed. To address this issue, we analyzed data on the diets of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) from Kibale National Park, Uganda, to evaluate temporal and spatial variability in the plant parts and species eaten. After considering observer differences and sampling issues, we evaluated how different a group\u0027s diet could be if samples were taken in different years. We found that the diet of the same groups showed significant, consistent changes over a 4\u2010year period. For example, the time spent feeding on leaves increased from 56% in 1994 to 76% in 1998. The plant parts and species eaten by eight groups inhabiting different types of forest (e.g., pristine, logged, riverine) varied among groups. The largest interdemic difference was seen in the use of young leaves (38%). Dietary differences were also found between groups with overlapping home ranges (41\u201349% overlap). Different subspecies of Procolobus badius also varied in diet; however, this variation was often not of the magnitude documented within Kibale for the same population. The fact that diet can vary considerably over small spatial and short temporal scales within the same species raises the intriguing question as to what level of interspecific difference is biologically significant for addressing particular questions. We conclude that behavioral flexibility blurs our traditional stereotypic assessment of primates; a study of one group that occupies a specific habitat at one point in time may not adequately represent the species.

J. Phys. Anthropol. 7:401\u2013424) presented a conundrum: among primates, sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is a developmental adjunct to dimorphism in other aspects of the body, albeit in the converse direction. Among species in which males are larger than females in body size, females are larger than males in some pelvic dimensions; species with little sexual dimorphism in nonpelvic size show little pelvic dimorphism. Obstetrical difficulty does not explain this relationship. The present study addresses this issue, evaluating the relationship between pelvic and femoral sexual dimorphism in 12 anthropoid species. The hypothesis is that species in which males are significantly larger than females in femoral size will have a higher incidence, magnitude, and variability of pelvic sexual dimorphism, with females having relatively larger pelves than males, compared with species monomorphic in femoral size. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. The proposed explanation is that the default pelvic anatomy in adulthood is that of the female; testosterone redirects growth from the default type to that of the male by differentially enhancing and repressing growth among the pelvic dimensions. Testosterone also influences sexual dimorphism of the femur. The magnitude of the pelvic response to testosterone is greater in species that are sexually dimorphic in the femur than in those that are monomorphic.

The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure\u2010determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein\u2010production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95%) and monodispersity (85%) below which a further optimization of the protein\u2010production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post\u2010translational modifications and protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein\u2010characterization methods using MS, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small\u2010angle X\u2010ray scattering within the EC Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described.

Animal models of viral demyelination and studies showing that JC virus (JCV), the polyomavirus which causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), may be latent in some normal human brains suggest another possibility.

A black lemur group was habituated and observed during the day and night for all months of die year (total 1272 h). When fruits were eaten, die plant species was identified, die maturity of the fruit and treatment of the seeds noted, and the fruit described in terms of ripe fruit color, husk thickness, fruit length, and seed length and width. Black lemur feces were searched for seeds; these were identified and signs of damage noted. Other potential dispersers feeding on the fruits of species eaten by the black lemur were also noted. The black lemurs were seen eating die fruits of 70 species. Of these, 51 species were defined as closely associated with black lemur dispersal and 16 species had seeds that were either often preyed upon or wasted by the black lemur, or were seen being eaten by other potential seed dispersers. Fruits of species in the former group were often dull colored (94% of species); rarely less than 1 cm long (6%); rarely had seeds less than 0.1 cm long or less than 0.1 cm wide (2 and 4%, respectively); never had seeds more than 4 cm long or greater than 2 cm wide; and quite often had either thick husks (49%) or thin husks (51%). In contrast, the fruits of the latter group were often brightly colored (75% of species) and nearly always had a thin husk (94%). Also, this latter group included more small and very large fruits and seeds than the former group. Fruit characteristics significantly associated with the former group were: dull color, thick husk, fruit length greater than 2 cm, seed length 1\u20134 cm, and seed width 1\u20132 cm. The extent to which these traits are the result of coevolution between plants and the guild of lemur dispersers that includes the black lemur is not clear, but a coevolved lemur\u2013fruit syndrome remains a possibility. RESUMES: Cette \u00E9tude porte sur la description des caracteristiques des fruits appartenant aux esp\u00E8ces dont la dissemination des graines est \u00E9troitement li\u00E9e au Eulemur macaco. Ces esp\u00E8ces sont definies comme \u00E9tant souvent diss\u00E9minees par E. macaco et uniquement diss\u00E9min\u00E9es par E. macaco dans la for\u25CBt de Lokobe. Dans le but d\u0027identifier ces esp\u00E9ces, un groupe de E. macaco a \u00E9t\u00E9 habitu\u00E9\u00E0 la pr\u00E9sence humaine et observ\u00E9 jour et nuit pendant tous les mois de 1\u0027ann\u00E9e (en total 1272 h). Une fois le fruit consomm\u00E9, I\u0027esp\u00E8ce \u00E9tait identify\u00E9e, la maturity\u00E9 du fruit ainsi que le traitement de la graine not\u00E9s et le fruit \u00E9tait d\u00E0crit en term\u00E9 de couleur \u00E1 maturity\u00E9, d\u0027\u00E9paisseur de I\u0027enveloppe, de longueur de fruit et de longueur et de largeur de graine. Par la suite, les f\u00E9ces sont recherch\u00E9s afin d\u0027identifier les graines qu\u0027ils contiennent et routes signes d\u0027endommagement de celles\u2010ci sont not\u00E9s.

Les E. macaco ont \u00E9t\u00E9 vu consommer les fruits de 70 esp\u00E8ces. De ces derni\u00E8res, 51 esp\u00E8ces \u00E9taient d\u00E9finies comm.\u00E9aetant \u00E9troitement li\u00E9es \u00E0 la diss\u00E9mination par E. macaco et les graines de 16 esp\u00E8ces sont soit consomm\u00E9es, soit gaspill\u00E9es par E. macaco, soit ont \u00E9t\u00E9 vu consomm\u00E9es par d\u0027autres agents de diss\u00E9mination potentiels. Les fruits des esp\u00E8ces appartenant au groupe pr\u00E9c\u00E9dent sont souvent d\u0027une couleur sombre (94% des esp\u00E8ces), d\u0027une longueur rarement \u003C 1 cm (6%), avaient rarement des fruits \u003C 0.1 cm de long ou \u003C 0.1 cm de large (2 et 4% respectivement) et n\u0027ont jamais des graines \u003E 4 cm de long ou \u003E 2 cm de large, et presque souvent avaient une enveloppe \u00E9paisse (49%) et presque souvent une enveloppe mince (51%). Par contre, les fruits du dernier groupe sont souvent d\u0027une couleur claire (75% des esp\u00E8ces) \u0027et presque toujours ont une enveloppe mince (94%). De plus, ce groupe inclut plus de petits et de tr\u00E8s larges fruits et graines que le premier groupe.

Concentrates of the virus were prepared from clarified and inactivated cell culture supernatants by cross\u2010flow ultrafiltration as described before. SEC on Sepharose 4 FF resulted in average product yields of 85% based on hemagglutination (HA) activity. Productivity was maximized to 0.15 column volumes (cv) of concentrate per hour yielding a reduction in total protein and host cell DNA (hcDNA) to 35 and 34%, respectively. AEC on Sepharose Q XL was used to separate hcDNA from virus at a salt concentration of 0.65 M sodium chloride. Product yields \u003E80% were achieved for loads \u003E160 kHAU/mL of resin. The reduction in hcDNA was 67\u2010fold. Split peak elution and bimodal particle volume distributions suggested aggregation of virions. Co\u2010elution with hcDNA and constant amounts of hcDNA per dose indiciated association of virions to hcDNA. An overall product yield of 52% was achieved. Total protein was reduced more than 19\u2010fold; hcDNA more than 500\u2010fold by the process. Estimation of the dose volume from HA activity predicted a protein content at the limit for human vaccines. Reduction of hcDNA was found insufficient (about 500 ng per dose) requiring further optimization of AEC or additional purification steps.

Bicistronic RUB replicons expressing an antibiotic resistance gene either in the presence or the absence of the RUB capsid (C) gene were used to study the structure of RCs in transfected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that the RUB replicase components P90 and P150 localized to CPVs, as did double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker for RNA synthesis. Electron microscopy (EM) showed that replicons generated CPVs containing small vesicles and large vacuoles, similar to CPVs from RUB\u2010infected cells and that the replicase proteins were sufficient for organelle recruitment. Some of these CPVs contained straight membranes. When cross\u2010sectioned, these rigid membranes appeared to be sheets of closely packed proteins. Immuno\u2010EM revealed that these sheets, apparently in contact with the cytosol, contained both P150 and P90, as well as dsRNA, and thus could be two\u2010dimensional arrays of functional viral replicases. Labelling of dsRNA after streptolysin\u2010O permeabilization showed that replication of viral genome takes place on the cytoplasmic side of CPVs. When present, C accumulated around CPVs.

However, prophylaxis was routinely used in early studies, and molecular diagnostic tools were not employed. The objective of this study was to review the incidence of PJP during and post\u2010FCR in the era of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics and (18)F\u2010fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)\u2013computerised tomography (CT). METHODS: All patients treated with standard FCR at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (March 2009 to June 2012) were identified from a medications management database. Laboratory\u2010confirmed PJP cases during this time were identified from an electronic database. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients were treated with a median of 5.5 FCR cycles. Eight PJP cases were identified, 6 of whom had received chemotherapy prior to FCR. In 5 cases, (18)F\u2010FDG PET demonstrated bilateral ground\u2010glass infiltrates. Median CD4(\u002B) lymphocyte counts at time of PJP diagnosis and 9\u201312 months following FCR were 123 and 400 cells/\u03BCL, respectively. In patients receiving no prophylaxis, 9.1% developed PJP during FCR. The rate following FCR was 18.4%, with median onset at 6 months (2.4\u201324 months). CONCLUSION: Given the high rate of late\u2010onset PJP, consideration should be given for extended PJP prophylaxis for up to 12 months post\u2010FCR, particularly in pretreated patients. Further evaluation of the role of CD4(\u002B) monitoring is warranted to quantify risk of disease development and to guide duration of prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haeusler, Gabrielle M.; Slavin, Monica A.; Seymour, John F.; Lingaratnam, Senthil; Teh, Benjamin W.; Tam, Constantine S.; Thursky, Karin A.; Worth, Leon J.","journal":"Eur J Haematol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/173b63533b5fcd6e6fd4b1058befa12b0319431e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Peter MacCallum"],"organizations":["FCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PJP cases","incidence of PJP","standard FCR","months post\u2010FCR","onset PJP","FCR cycles","extended PJP prophylaxis","time of PJP diagnosis","median onset","duration of prophylaxis","Median CD4","pretreated patients","FDG PET","OBJECTIVE","computerised tomography","role of CD4","electronic database","positron emission tomography","molecular diagnostic tools","sensitive molecular diagnostics","high rate of late","medications management database","low reported incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","bilateral ground","rituximab","early studies","fluorodeoxyglucose","cyclophosphamide","lymphocyte","consideration","Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre","glass infiltrates","Fludarabine","lymphoid malignancies","risk of disease development","monitoring","evaluation","CONCLUSION","METHODS","study","cells","Laboratory","\u03BCL","RESULTS","chemotherapy"],"language":"en"},

As proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the development and maintenance of local inflammation, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of OMZ on immune cells in order to diminish the mucosal infiltration of the nose. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from buffy coats of healthy volunteers were isolated and stimulated in the presence or absence of OMZ. In addition, monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells (DC) were generated and different concentrations of OMZ were added. DC phenotype and their T\u2010cell stimulatory properties were analysed. The vasoactive substance OMZ showed a concentration dependent inhibitory effect on T\u2010cell activation as well as a dominant effect on T\u2010cell stimulatory properties of DC. Low concentrations of OMZ inhibited the proliferation of polyclonally activated T cells. In addition, secretion of proinflammatory mediators such as the cytokines interleukin\u20101\u03B2 (IL\u20101\u03B2), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03B1 (TNF \u03B1), IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 were inhibited in the presence of physiological doses of OMZ. Interestingly, the addition of IL\u20106 to DC\u2010T\u2010cell co\u2010culture was able to completely restore T\u2010cell proliferation. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the anti\u2010inflammatory properties of OMZ are partially mediated by the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines as well as reduced T\u2010cell stimulatory capacity of DC resulting in a repressed stimulation of T cells. Therefore, the therapeutic benefit of OMZ can be explained in part by its immunomodulating effects in the topical treatment of nasal inflammation.","publish_time":"2007-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuettenberg, Andrea; Koelsch, Stephan; Knop, J\u00FCrgen; Jonuleit, Helmut","journal":"Exp Dermatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd4f015d899328acf9da0ef545bbcc6f6da91722.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influence of OMZ","absence of OMZ","reduced T","anti\u2010inflammatory properties of OMZ","cell stimulatory properties of DC","cell proliferation","Low concentrations of OMZ","different concentrations of OMZ","cell stimulatory capacity of DC","repressed stimulation of T cells","vasoactive substance OMZ","therapeutic benefit of OMZ","cell activation","addition of IL","proliferation of polyclonally activated T cells","presence of physiological doses of OMZ","DC phenotype","immune cells","cell co\u2010culture","derived dendritic cells","inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells","cytokines interleukin","topical treatment of nasal inflammation","secretion of proinflammatory mediators","topical treatment of rhinitis","dominant effect","TNF \u03B1","maintenance of local inflammation","nasal decongestant oxymetazoline","concentration dependent inhibitory effect","PBMC","tumor necrosis factor","buffy coats of healthy volunteers","development","critical role","order","monocyte","aim","mucosal infiltration","immunomodulating effects","study","findings","sinusitis","nose","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Using immunohistochemical techniques, all three types of lymphocytes (CD4\u2010positive T\u2010cells, CD8\u2010 positive T\u2010cells and B\u2010cells) were found in the vicinity of the lesion site within hours and persisted for up to 7 days.

A second, late phase of cell infiltration, dominated by CD8\u2010positive T\u2010lymphocytes, occurred in mice that had been raised in a conventional breeding unit and had acquired antibody titres to a common murine virus (mouse hepatitis virus).

Infection of mice with a non\u2010pathogenic strain of Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) engineered to express an epitope from Haemophilus influenzae (HI) sharing 6/13 amino acids with the dominant proteolipid protein (PLP) epitope, PLP(139\u2013151), can induce CNS autoimmune disease.

However, there exists a default position wherein niches of species in a community are determined by their evolutionary and biogeographic histories, irrespective of other species within the community. According to this viewpoint, a broad range of pair\u2010wise niche overlaps\u2014from completely overlapping to completely distinct\u2014are expected in any community without the need to invoke interspecific interactions. We develop a method that can test for both habitat associations and niche differences along an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal niche dimensions and apply it to a 24\u2010yr data set of the eight dominant woody\u2010plant species (representing 84% and 76% of total community abundance and basal area, respectively) from a 50\u2010ha permanent plot in a southern Indian tropical dry forest, using edaphic, topographic, and precipitation variables as niche axes. Species separated into two broad groups in niche space\u2014one consisting of three canopy species and the other of a canopy species and four understory species\u2014along axes that corresponded mainly to variation in soil P, Al and a topographic index of wetness. Species within groups tended to have significantly greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Community\u2010wide niche overlap in spatial and temporal niche axes was never smaller than expected by chance. Species\u2010habitat associations were neither necessary nor sufficient preconditions for niche differences to be present. Our results suggest that this tropical dry\u2010forest community consists of several tree species with broadly overlapping niches, and where significant niche differences do exist, they are not readily interpretable as evidence for niche differentiation. We argue, based on a survey of the literature, that many of the observed niche differences in tropical forests are more parsimoniously viewed as autecological differences between species that exist independently of interspecific interactions.","publish_time":"2017-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulla, Sandeep; Suresh, Hebbalalu S.; Dattaraja, Handanakere S.; Sukumar, Raman","journal":"Ecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16ac15993fc350020c6297a434b5466b4d944fd5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7aa7477efcf02c48ce97218a7325bf51bc94d783.json; document_parses/pdf_json/63bfbebf4511dc6e5a54b596a16c333362c651e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distinct niche","niche space","niche differentiation","observed niche differences","significant niche differences","plant species","canopy species","temporal niche axes","tree species","understory species","temporal niche dimensions","wide niche overlap","greater niche overlap","scaled niche partitioning","wise niche overlaps","interspecific niche differences structure plant communities","forest community","autecological differences","fitness differences","total community abundance","interspecific interactions","tropical forests","habitat associations","broad groups","niches","chance","southern Indian tropical dry forest","arbitrary number of spatial","broad range of pair","topographic index of wetness","sufficient preconditions","dominant woody","ha permanent plot","extreme viewpoints","precipitation variables","consisting","soil P","variation","basal area","extent","yr data set","neutrality","biogeographic histories","evidence","need","literature","results","default position","survey","method"],"language":"en"},

We have characterized the processing of the endoplasmic reticulum\u2010restricted glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed poison tail (Gpt), biochemically and enzymatically, and by T cell recognition assays. Expressed with a vaccinia vector, Gpt remains endoglycosidase H\u2010sensitive and does not mature to endoglycosidase D sensitivity. The protein is degraded in the ER with a T1/2 of 4 h.

Using flow cytometry, Gpt is undetectable on the plasma membrane; in contrast, wild\u2010type G is readily found on the surface or secreted into the milieu as soluble G following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia recombinant expressing G.

Their unique genetic constitution, high virulence and wide host range set them apart from other paramyxoviruses. These characteristics have led to their classification into the new genus Henpavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae and to their designation as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens. The fusion protein, an enveloped glycoprotein essential for viral entry, belongs to the family of class I fusion proteins and is characterized by the presence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. These two regions associate to form a fusion\u2010active hairpin conformation that juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes to facilitate membrane fusion and enable subsequent viral entry. The Hendra and Nipah virus fusion core proteins were crystallized and their structures determined to 2.2 \u00C5 resolution. The Nipah and Hendra fusion core structures are six\u2010helix bundles with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of a central coiled coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner. Because of the high level of conservation in core regions, it is proposed that the Nipah and Hendra virus fusion cores can provide a model for membrane fusion in all paramyxoviruses. The relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil represent a good target site for drug discovery strategies aimed at inhibiting viral entry by blocking hairpin formation.","publish_time":"2006-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lou, Zhiyong; Xu, Yanhui; Xiang, Kehui; Su, Nan; Qin, Lan; Li, Xu; Gao, George F.; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5275ce83c67dbb432aae3705b193fa47638928e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["membrane fusion","fusion proteins","Hendra fusion core structures","Nipah virus fusion core proteins","Hendra virus fusion cores","core regions","subsequent viral entry","Hendra viruses","central coiled coil","surface","HR2 helices","pathogenic paramyxoviruses","parallel HR1 helices","high level of conservation","high virulence","family Paramyxoviridae","family of class","hydrophobic grooves","Biosafety Level","deep grooves","hairpin formation","active hairpin conformation","good target site","livestock","drug discovery strategies","serious disease outbreaks","Australia","humans","enveloped glycoprotein essential","model","flying foxes","wide host range","helix bundles","Malaysia","new genus Henpavirus","unique genetic constitution","designation","oblique antiparallel manner","heptad repeat","cellular membranes","classification","Singapore","presence","Bangladesh","pathogens","\u00C5 resolution","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

To understand the functions of these proteins, we cloned cDNA fragments covering these ORFs into expression plasmids, and expressed the constructs in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Expression of a construct containing ORF8a and ORF8b generated only a single protein, 8a; no 8b protein expression was obtained. Expression of a construct containing ORF8 generated the 8ab fusion protein.

Glycosylation could also stabilize protein 8ab.

Methods Using lung simulators, readily available plastic tubing, and ventilators (840 Series Ventilator; Puritan\u2010Bennett), human lung simulators were added in parallel until the ventilator was ventilating the equivalent of four adults. Data collected included peak pressure, positive end\u2010expiratory pressure, total tidal volume, and total minute ventilation. Any obvious asymmetry in the delivery of gas to the lung simulators was also documented. The ventilator was run for almost 12 consecutive hours (5.5 hours of pressure control and more than six hours of volume control). Results Using readily available plastic tubing set up to minimize dead space volume, the four lung simulators were easily ventilated for 12 hours using one ventilator. In pressure control (set at 25 mm H(2)O), the mean tidal volume was 1,884 mL (approximately 471 mL/lung simulator) with an average minute ventilation of 30.2 L/min (or 7.5 L/min/lung simulator). In volume control (set at 2 L), the mean peak pressure was 28 cm H(2)O and the minute ventilation was 32.5 L/min total (8.1 L/min/lung simulator). Conclusions A single ventilator may be quickly modified to ventilate four simulated adults for a limited time.

Genetic identities I and Similarity Indices SI are calculated between 12 samples of Taraxacum, on the basis of 40 isozymes at 15 loci for 10 enzyme systems. Samples included three polyploid agamospermous populations from northern England (group 1), three sexual diploid populations from south\u2010central France (group 2), and six accessions of \u2018primitive\u2019 diploid self\u2010compatible sexual taxa from southern Europe and Australia. Samples could be assigned to eight species, classified in seven sections of the genus. Two clusters of high relationship were evident. All the group 1 and group 2 species were very closely related, with pairwise comparisons for I in excess of 0.93. The three group 3 accessions identified as T. bessarabicum showed pairwise comparisons for SI in excess of 0.71. Comparisons for SI between the other group 3 species, and between all the group 3 species and the group 1 and 2 species were all very low, not exceeding 0.45. It is concluded that dissimilarity between samples as assessed by isozymes is probably related to the time of evolutionary divergence of those samples. Although allopolyploid, and morphologically very diverse, the group 1 agamospecies may have very recently diverged asexually from a common stock. The group 2 diploids may have resulted from rediploidization and regained sexuality from the same originally agamospermous stock. In areas of Europe in which such \u2018modern\u2019 sexuality is common, it is probable that all \u2018modern\u2019 Taraxaca, including at least five sections of the genus, should be included within a single taxon. In contrast, \u2018primitive\u2019 self\u2010compatible sexual species in group 3 appear to have diverged from each other several million years ago, and with the exception of the disjunct accessions of T. bessarabicum, are genetically highly distinct.

Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-\u03B3. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-\u03B3 production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-\u03B3 levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection.

Our previous study proposed a non-invasive method named cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) to stage liver cirrhosis. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) has been widely used for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve; however, whether ICG-R15 is well correlated with cirrhotic severity, and especially whether comparable with CSS in predicting cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. METHODS: Overall, 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function undergoing hepatectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied. Cirrhotic severity was pathologically assessed using the Laennec staging system. The correlations between ICG-R15, CSS, and cirrhotic severity were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of ICG-R15 and CSS in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and 90-day mortality was compared. RESULTS: Patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis accounted for 15.9%, 29.2%, 35.9%, and 19.0%, respectively, in the entire cohort. ICG-R15 was found to be less than 10% in 100%, 93.3%, 86.3%, and 70.1% of the patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis, respectively. There was only a weak correlation between ICG-R15 and the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.325; P \u003C 0.001). However, CSS showed a strong correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.788; P \u003C 0.001). For those with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.1%, 72.8%, and 72.1%, respectively. In addition, CSS was superior to ICG-R15 in predicting PHLF and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CSS was more useful than ICG-R15 in the preoperative assessment of cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function. More studies are needed to further validate CSS in patients with different Child-Pugh grades.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Jin; Zhang, Erlei; Liang, Binyong; Zhang, Zunyi; Chen, Xiaoping; Huang, Zhiyong","journal":"World J Surg Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88c3295b1a031451a35a72d781e48fe9e97ec7b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7181509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSS","HCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICG-R15","pathological severity of liver cirrhosis","cirrhotic severity scoring","HCC patients","liver function","accuracy of CSS","performance of ICG","preoperative assessment of cirrhotic severity","stage liver cirrhosis","severe cirrhosis","predicting posthepatectomy liver failure","different Child-Pugh grades","predicting PHLF","day mortality","strong correlation","weak correlation","preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve","surgical modalities","non-invasive method","hepatocellular carcinoma","normal range","Indocyanine green retention rate","previous study","BACKGROUND","addition","correlations","Laennec staging system","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","entire cohort","studies"],"language":"en"},

It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnacle, James; Gurney, Stefan; Ledot, Stephane; Singh, Suveer","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c891b564b39c2a0b9e7ff68fe9264431d081388a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe acute respiratory failure","acute severe respiratory failure","days","autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage","respiratory ECMO support","view of progressive respiratory failure","normal lung function","induced lung injury","differential diagnosis","severe headaches","Leptospirosis","day of emergency admission","CASE PRESENTATION","h of admission","patients","Anuric acute kidney injury","quadrant lung infiltrates","day history of malaise","broad spectrum antibiotics","femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO","prompt diagnosis","suspected vasculitic","thorough history","parenchymal recovery","vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation","developed pneumomediastinum","low normal gas transfer","classical progressive late red tinge","photophobia","clearance of endobronchial clot","prevention of ventilator","recreational risk factors","positive Leptospira IgM","specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit","neck stiffness","results","CT scan findings","fresh clots","early consideration","returned lavage fluid","hypoxaemic","year-old","fevers","urea","imaging","pulsed methylprednisolone","ICU","real-time PCR","Serial bronchoscopies","trout farm worker","diarrhoea","haemoptysis","treatment","situation","wide range of symptoms","diagnostic clue","protective ventilatory management","resolution","delay","lifesaving","minority of cases","fatal zoonosis","Steroids","clear evidence","mortality","immediate haemofiltration","young males","jaundice","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","months follow-up"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality that has had a major impact on health and health care services worldwide. Hong Kong has had a significant number of cases and deaths. Nurses, at the vanguard of the clinical health care team, have been particularly affected by it. The outbreak prompted the health authorities to implement a series of public health measures and hospital policies, including a guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with SARS. Aims and objectives. This paper aims at providing an overview of what is known about SARS and the impact it has had in Hong Kong and to highlight from the perspective of a school of nursing the major clinical, educational and public health implications. Conclusions. The lack of understanding and uncertainty about the disease led to significant variation in the provision of information, contributing to the confusion and anxiety in the community. Therefore, there is a need to revise the nursing curriculum, to provide continuing education to all health care professionals, particularly with regard to infection control measures, and to revisit the range of public health policies to ensure the health of the community is protected by these policies. There also has been a reaffirmation of the importance of health promotion that highlights the importance of the partnership between nurses, health policy makers and public health personnel. It is evident that the organization and delivery of clinical practice, teaching and health promotion have to be flexible and responsive to a changing health scenario. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses must play a crucial role in the prevention, detection and containment of SARS. They will need to implement and ensure strict adherence to infection control measures and, in some circumstances, isolation and quarantine may be warranted. Attention to the psychological state of patients and family members should not be overlooked. Paramount is education of patients, families and members of the public at large.","publish_time":"2004-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, David R.; Lopez, Violeta; Lee, Diana; Twinn, Sheila","journal":"J Clin Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/984a1204490eb9129dbb6934d0fff9622f9fa273.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Paramount"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["health authorities","public health personnel","public health implications","health care professionals","health care services","importance of health promotion","series of public health measures","range of public health policies","clinical health care team","health policy makers","changing health scenario","Nurses","education of patients","containment of SARS","delivery of clinical practice","infection control measures","significant morbidity","significant variation","major impact","management of patients","hospital policies","Hong Kong","community","need","significant number of cases","psychological state of patients","continuing education","nursing curriculum","school of nursing","family members","new infectious disease","mortality","regard","prevention","detection","partnership","families","teaching","vanguard","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","crucial role","guideline","circumstances","uncertainty","organization","diagnosis","strict adherence","provision of information","confusion","deaths","Attention","perspective","Paramount","reaffirmation","lack of understanding","isolation","quarantine","anxiety","overview","Relevance","outbreak","paper","objectives","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alternative neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) regimens compared to standard of care in patients hospitalized for H1N1, H3N2, or B influenza. METHODS: The Cochrane collaboration searching methods were followed in Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science databases (2009\u20132019). Eligibility criteria were RCTs comparing different regimens of NAIs in hospitalized patients (at least 1 year old) for clinically diagnosed influenza (H1N1, H3N2, or B). Pre-defined endpoints were time to clinical resolution (TTCR), overall mortality, hospital discharge, viral clearance, drug-related adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Seven trials (1579 patients) were included. Two trials compared two regimens of oral oseltamivir therapy, and one trial compared two regimens of intravenous zanamivir therapy vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Four trials focused on intravenous peramivir therapy: two trials compared two different regimens and two trials compared two different regimens vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Overall, the different regimens were well tolerated, with no significant differences in AEs; nonetheless non-significant differences were reported among different regimens regarding TTCR, mortality, and viral clearance. CONCLUSION: Higher compared to standard doses of NAIs or systemic peramivir therapy compared to oral oseltamivir therapy did not demonstrate benefit.

To prepare students for this environment, a newly developed, evidence-based e-learning module was designed and implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether e-learning is a feasible method in preparing PT students for clinical work in complex ICU environments, as perceived by students and experts. METHODS: A mixed methods proof of concept study was undertaken. Participants were final-year students of an international curriculum, and experts from didactic and clinical fields. An e-learning module consisting of 7 separate chapters based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical expertise was developed, piloted and incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum as a compulsory course to be completed prior to clinical ICU rotations. Data were collected through 3 focus group meetings and 5 semi-structured interviews; these meetings and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed. RESULTS: The study sample comprised of 14 students and 5 experts. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: expected competencies of PT students in ICU, feeling prepared for ICU clinical work and dealing with local variety. The e-learning module enabled students to anticipate clinical situations and PT tasks in the ICU. Higher level clinical reasoning skills, handling of lines and wires and dealing with out-of-textbook situations could not be achieved with the e-learning module alone. CONCLUSIONS: An e-learning module can sufficiently prepare PT students for their clinical tasks in the ICU, as long as it is integrated with, or closely connected to, the students\u2019 clinical placement.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Major, Mel E.; Ramaekers, Stephan P.

Further, the current crisis in health care costs has critically underscored the need for research and development into highly effective, but low cost means of delivering health care. With a focus on providing clinically actionable information at or near the patient, point-of-care devices provide clinicians with information that is critical to the management of patient care while they are still with the patient. Rapid information results in various advantages for POC testing in different kinds of health care settings. In primary care settings in developed countries, the shortened timeline between testing and availability of results reduces the need for extra office visits or follow-up phone calls to convey testing results and adjust clinical intervention. This strategy can reduce cost and increase access of otherwise underserved populations to medical care. For diseases that are infectious, such as sexually transmitted infections or respiratory diseases, POC testing can facilitate treatment modalities quickly, thus preventing further spread of the infection for better and timely clinical management. In acute care settings, timely access to diagnostic information is most critical for providing an effective medical response. In disaster settings, POC diagnostics can speed triage and enable rapid establishment and delivery of medical services.","publish_time":"2011-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical care","care technologies","care devices","health care issues","health care costs","primary care settings","acute care settings","management of patient care","unmet health care needs","different kinds of health care settings","POC testing","testing results","Rapid information results","diagnostic information","disaster settings","actionable information","POC diagnostics","availability of results","timely access","timely clinical management","effective medical response","delivery of medical services","rapid establishment","respiratory diseases","low cost","clinical intervention","global focus","importance of point","follow-up phone calls","various advantages","extra office visits","developed countries","shortened timeline","triage","transmitted infections","cost-effective solutions","underserved populations","development","current crisis","clinicians","treatment modalities","research","strategy"],"language":"en"},

To improve understanding of the immuno\u2010pathological processes involved in lung injury associated with SARS, the temporal changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles in the sera of SARS patients were compared with those of patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP), according to the degree of lung involvement. Methods: Serum levels of 11 cytokines and chemokines, in 14 patients with SARS and 24 patients with CAP, were serially checked using a bead\u2010based multiassay system. Sera from 12 healthy subjects were used as normal controls. Results: The serum levels of interferon\u2010\u03B3\u2010inducible protein\u201010 (IP\u201010), IL\u20102 and IL\u20106 were significantly elevated during SARS infection. In patients with CAP, but not in those with SARS, the levels of interferon\u2010\u03B3, IL\u201010, IL\u20108 and monokine induced by interferon\u2010\u03B3 (MIG) were significantly elevated compared with the levels in healthy controls. Among the chemokines/cytokines, IL\u20106 levels correlated most strongly with radiographic scores (r = 0.62). The elevation of IP\u201010 and IL\u20102 antedated the development of chest involvement and reached peak levels earlier than the radiographic scores. In contrast, the dynamic changes in IL\u20106, C\u2010reactive protein and neutrophils occurred synchronously with the changes in radiographic scores. The mean ratio of IL\u20106 to IL\u201010 in SARS patients (4.84; range 0.41\u201321) was significantly higher than that in CAP patients (2.95; range 0.02\u201310.57) (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The early induction of IP\u201010 and IL\u20102, as well as the subsequent over\u2010production of IL\u20106 and lack of IL\u201010 production, probably contribute to the main immuno\u2010pathological processes involved in lung injury in SARS. These changes in cytokine/chemokine profile are remarkably different from those observed in CAP patients.","publish_time":"2006-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHIEN, Jung\u2010Yien; HSUEH, Po\u2010Ren; CHENG, Wern\u2010Cherng; YU, Chong\u2010Jen; YANG, Pan\u2010Chyr","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e32793030a6d5617ddd6bdc5398df1d1760afd65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192207.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["SARS","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lack of IL","CAP patients","sera of SARS patients","SARS sequelae","SARS infection","mean ratio of IL","subsequent over\u2010production of IL","Pathological changes","serum levels of interferon","peak levels","temporal changes","dynamic changes","chemokine production","radiographic scores","lung injury","main immuno\u2010pathological processes","chemokine profiles","dysregulation of cytokine","cytokines","degree of lung involvement","chemokines","healthy controls","elevation of IP","range","early induction of IP","inducible protein","reactive protein","healthy subjects","normal controls","development of chest involvement","severe acute respiratory syndrome","background","neutrophils","bead","based multiassay system","Conclusions","understanding","Objective","Methods","community","pneumonia","Results","contrast","monokine","MIG"],"language":"en"},

Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. IMPORTANCE Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from countries where the disease is endemic. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks has been largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of DENV4 transmission to and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental United States in the absence of a human case during two consecutive years. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high-tourism areas of the United States may enable proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyles, Sean M.; Mavian, Carla N.; Finol, Esteban; Ukhanova, Maria; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Hamerlinck, Gabriela; Kang, Seokyoung; Baumgartner, Caleb; Geesey, Mary; Stinton, Israel; Williams, Katie; Mathias, Derrick K.; Prosperi, Mattia; Mai, Volker; Salemi, Marco; Buckner, Eva A.; Lednicky, John A.; Rivers, Adam R.; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9011eb415cf4a9be661570efdfe93dc73dce3d64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193045.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Caribbean","Florida","Texas","U.S."],"keyphrases":["dengue mosquito vector","DENV4 infections","local DENV4 human case","mosquito vector infections","dengue outbreaks","dengue infections","local mosquito vector population","DENV4 human index case","DENV4 strain","local transmission","molecular surveillance of mosquito populations","dengue virus serotype","documented report of DENV4 transmission","continental United States","increased introductions of dengue virus","mediated DENV4 persistence","absence","documented case","virus transmission success","populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes","mosquito-specific virome associations","human travel","virus origin","Manatee County","potential arbovirus outbreaks","potential local outbreak","targeted vector control","Florida","implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance","advance of predictable transmission seasons","significance of prolonged maintenance","inability of current surveillance paradigms","Caribbean region","time period","year period","proactive preventative efforts","respect","reverse transcriptase PCR","sustained research effort","viral genetic signatures","high-tourism areas","validated infection","countries","genome","migration","public health response","phenomenon","decade","disease","episodes","consecutive years","data","microbiome","metavirome","IMPORTANCE","incidence","Texas","finding"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the effects of anthropogenic land use on functional richness of local hoverfly communities of 24 agricultural landscapes across temperate Europe. A multivariate ordination separated seven functional groups based on resource use, niche characteristics and response type. Intensive land use reduced functional richness, but each functional group responded in a unique way. Species richness of generalist groups was nearly unaffected. Local habitat quality mainly affected specialist groups, while land use affected intermediate groups of rather common species. We infer that high species richness within functional groups alone is no guarantee for maintaining functional richness.

Thirty\u2010four patients with root\u2010filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (\u00B1SD) of species detected was 33.7\u00B13.3 in Group 1 and 21.3\u00B16.3 in Group 2 (P\u003C0.001). The majority of the probe\u2010detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon\u2010released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the \u201Ccheckerboard\u201D DNA\u2010DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.","publish_time":"2001-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sunde, P.

Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems but are threatened globally by many forms of human disturbance. Understanding the responses of wetland species to human disturbance is essential for effective wetland management and conservation. 2. We undertook a study to determine (i) whether anurans can be used effectively to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands affected by groundwater withdrawal and, if so, (ii) what effect increasing urbanization might have on the utility of anurans as wetland indicators. We monitored the intensity of anuran calls at 42 wetlands in south\u2010western Florida throughout 2001\u20132002 and 2005\u20132009. 3. We first validated the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity using a small group of wetlands by comparing anuran calling and subsequent tadpole development with an established index employing vegetation composition and structure. We then verified that the results could be expanded to a variety of sites throughout the region. Finally, we focused on urbanized wetlands to determine whether urbanization could interfere with the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity. 4. We used PRESENCE to estimate occupancy and detection probabilities and to examine the relationship between occupancy and five covariates expected to influence individual species occurrence. We used FRAGSTATS to calculate the mean proximity index for urbanized wetlands, which assesses the size and distribution of land use types within a specified area. 5. Our results showed that the group of species including oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus, southern cricket frog Acris gryllus, pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis, barking treefrog Hyla gratiosa, and little grass frog Pseudacris ocularis is a reliable indicator of wetland integrity. However, this same group of species, which is sensitive to wetland health, is selectively excluded from urbanized wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Although anurans are effective indicators of wetland health and complement vegetation surveys, the usefulness of this group for monitoring the ecological integrity of wetlands can be substantially reduced, or eliminated, as a consequence of urbanization. We urge for careful consideration of confounding factors in any studies examining the utility of indicator species.","publish_time":"2012-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guzy, Jacquelyn C.; McCoy, Earl D.; Deyle, Anna C.; Gonzalez, Shannon M.; Halstead, Neal; Mushinsky, Henry R.","journal":"J Appl Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da6c9550f78b1a676a28ca83ecfc81202d20d1ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urbanized wetlands","wetland indicators","ecological integrity of wetlands","responses of wetland species","group of species","small group of wetlands","reliable indicator of wetland integrity","use of anurans","effective wetland management","effective indicators of wetland health","utility of anurans","utility of indicator species","individual species occurrence","occupancy","consequence of urbanization","results","treefrog Hyla gratiosa","forms of human disturbance","pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis","established index","vegetation surveys","distribution of land use types","vegetation composition","intensity of anuran","mean proximity index","southern cricket frog Acris gryllus","little grass frog Pseudacris ocularis","oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus","studies","size","subsequent tadpole development","covariates","careful consideration of confounding factors","detection probabilities","relationship","specified area","structure","conservation","groundwater withdrawal","PRESENCE","FRAGSTATS","usefulness","variety of sites","south\u2010western Florida","region","important ecosystems","Synthesis","applications","study"],"language":"en"},

Thorough studies have been carried out on many species of this genus and have generated immense data about the chemical composition and corresponding biological activity of extracts and isolated secondary metabolites. In this work, we review the chemistry and pharmacology of the genus Bupleurum and explore the relationships between the pharmacological effects and the chemical composition of these drugs. Key findings Early studies on the genus Bupleurum had focused only on the traditional uses of the plants in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and infectious diseases. After chemical profiling, several groups of secondary metabolites were characterized with relevant biological activity: triterpene saponins (saikosaponins), lignans, essential oils and polysaccharides. As a result, present interest is now focused on the bioactivity of the isolated triterpene saponins acting as immunomodulatory, anti\u2010inflammatory and antiviral agents, as well as on the observed ant\u2010iulcer activity of the polysaccharides and anti\u2010proliferative activity of different lignans. Many saikosaponins exhibited very potent anti\u2010inflammatory, hepatoprotective and immunomodulatory activities both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions Further investigations and screenings are required to explore other Bupleurum species, to evaluate the clinical safety and possible interactions with other drugs or herbs. Standardization of Bupleuri extracts is crucial for them being integrated into conventional medicine due to large chemical and biological variations between different species and varieties.","publish_time":"2010-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashour, Mohamed L.; Wink, Michael","journal":"J Pharm Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf75a35ff5fa9fd46891e45f8887efceb926cbae.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d29cfd33e0a548e0d9ac1f5b7a3fba8e0634aac7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bupleuri"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["chemical composition","genus Bupleurum","Bupleurum species","relevant biological activity","corresponding biological activity of extracts","iulcer activity","chemical profiling","different species","biological variations","anti\u2010proliferative activity of different lignans","isolated triterpene saponins","isolated secondary metabolites","polysaccharides","saikosaponins","herbal drugs","groups of secondary metabolites","Standardization of Bupleuri extracts","potent anti\u2010inflammatory","immunomodulatory activities","infectious diseases","Thorough studies","treatment of inflammatory disorders","Objectives Radix Bupleuri","Key findings Early studies","plants","possible interactions","hepatoprotective","clinical safety","immense data","conventional medicine","pharmacological effects","chemistry","essential oils","relationships","Asia","varieties","observed ant","traditional uses","screenings","herbs","antiviral agents","pharmacology","bioactivity","Conclusions","investigations","years","result","work"],"language":"en"},

Detection of these RNA H-type pseudoknots can improve our understanding of RNA structures and their associated functions. However, the currently existing programs for detecting such RNA H-type pseudoknots are still time consuming and sometimes even ineffective. Therefore, efficient and effective tools for detecting the RNA H-type pseudoknots are needed. Results: In this paper, we have adopted a heuristic approach to develop a novel tool, called HPknotter, for efficiently and accurately detecting H-type pseudoknots in an RNA sequence. In addition, we have demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of HPknotter by testing on some sequences with known H-type pseudoknots. Our approach can be easily extended and applied to other classes of more general pseudoknots.

We found that abdominal irradiation of \u03B3-rays could induce ACF in the rat colon. The irradiation was performed once a week at a dose rate of 2 or 3 Gy per irradiation. Irradiation-induced ACF were observed in the colon at 10 weeks after the first irradiation at dose of 2 Gy for six times or 3 Gy for four times. Dietary SBF had no effect on the number of ACF, aberrant crypts (AC) or AC/focus induced by abdominal \u03B3-irradiation. However, an ingestion of SBF resulted in an increase in the number of these parameters in apoptosis-suppressed rats by cycloheximide (CHX). An injection of CHX suppressed irradiation-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells for at least 6 h after the irradiation. In CHX-injected rats, an ingestion of SBF significantly increased the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus compared with fiber-free fed rats at 9 weeks after the first irradiation. On the other hand, in saline-injected rats, no significant difference was found between SBF and fiber-free diets in the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus through the experimental period. These results suggest that dietary SBF may be involved in the elimination of abnormal cells from an irradiated colon through the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells.

Here we describe a new phylogenetic analytical method to study the sources and dissemination paths of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in Taiwan Methods A phylogenetic analytical tool for combining nucleotide sequences from 6 variable regions of a SARS-CoV genome was developed by use of 20 published SARS-CoV sequences; and this method was validated by use of 80 published SARS-CoV sequences. Subsequently, this new tool was applied to provide a better understanding of the entire complement of Taiwanese SARS-CoV isolates, including 20 previously published and 19 identified in this study. The epidemiological data were integrated with the results from the phylogenetic tree and from the nucleotide-signature pattern Results The topologies of phylogenetic trees generated by the new and the conventional strategies were similar, with the former having better robustness than the latter, especially in comparison with the maximum-likelihood trees: the new strategy revealed that during 2003 there were 5 waves of epidemic SARS-CoV infection, which belonged to 3 phylogenetic clusters in Taiwan Conclusions The new strategy is more efficient than its conventional counterparts.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Heat, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, octanoic acid, and solvent/detergent (S/D) methods were tested individually for their ability to inactivate SARS\u2010CoV in protein solutions appropriately mimicking blood\u2010derived products. Treated samples were tested for inactivation in a tissue culture growth assay. RESULTS: Viral inactivation by heat treatment at 60\u00B0C required 15 to 30 minutes to inactivate the SARS\u2010CoV. UVC efficiently inactivated SARS\u2010CoV in 40 minutes, whereas UVA required the addition of psoralen to enhance inactivation of the virus.

Two extensive forest vegetation survey datasets are explored, using ordination and classification, for evidence of in situ regeneration by Pinus strobus (Eastern white pine) and P. resinosa (Red pine). Ordination of tree species contributions to total basal area in 320 upland northern hardwood\u2010 conifer stands produced distinct stand groups for P.banksiana, P. resinosa, P. strobus and mesic hardwoods in an ascending sequence along the first axis. Quercus rubra (red oak), Q. alba (white oak) and tolerant conifer groups formed segregates from the hardwood complex along the second axis. P. strobus mixes with all other forest types, but P. resinosa is restricted to its own group. Seedlings and trees of P. strobus are more abundant than saplings, which are restricted to the pine and oak forests. Therefore, seed production, dispersal and seedling establishment seem to be less of a barrier to in situ regeneration by P. strobus than subsequent survival and growth. Canonical correspondence analysis of 170 pine\u2010dominated stands from the Canadian Shield of Ontario, in which tree species variables are segmented into height\u2010class pseudo\u2010 species, yielded no linear relationship between environmental features or stand structure and seedling densities of P. strobus. However, total tree basal area appears to impose an upper limit to seedling density on the forest floor. Strong correlations emerged between pine seedling density and understorey vegetation. Stand classification of the understorey vegetation, using constrained indicator species analysis, yielded distinct high and low seedling groups. Low pine seedling density was associated with abundant broadleaved shrubs, herbs and seedlings as well as feathermosses and tolerant conifers. High seedling density could not be ascribed to the presence of seedbed taxa, such as Polytrichum, but is ascribed to the absence of competition and other forms of inhibition in the understorey vegetation and down through the canopy profile. In situ regeneration of P. strobus does, therefore, occur but conditions over the forest landscape are largely restrictive.","publish_time":"2009-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carleton, T.J.; Maycock, P.F.; Arnup, R.; Gordon, A.M.","journal":"J Veg Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92587c3400c7a2bb9c7a9fa9ffccb76ee6ebd5fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Quercus","P. strobus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Low pine seedling density","High seedling density","low seedling groups","Pinus strobus","seedling establishment","seedling densities of","Red pine","strobus mixes","understorey vegetation","Eastern white pine","resinosa","situ regeneration of","tree species variables","Ordination of tree species contributions","white oak","forest types","red oak","forest landscape","forest floor","tolerant conifer groups","total tree basal area","produced distinct stand groups","extensive forest vegetation survey datasets","total basal area","constrained indicator species analysis","class pseudo\u2010 species","Seedlings","oak forests","classification","axis","hardwood complex","dominated stands","tolerant conifers","upland northern hardwood","abundant broadleaved shrubs","Canonical correspondence analysis","linear relationship","structure","height","banksiana","environmental features","Canadian Shield of Ontario","herbs","mesic hardwoods","segregates","evidence","alba","upper limit","ascending sequence","forms of inhibition","subsequent survival","feathermosses","seed production","dispersal","Strong correlations","growth","Quercus rubra","trees of","presence of seedbed taxa","absence of competition","canopy profile","Polytrichum","conditions","barrier","saplings"],"language":"en"},

One such secondary structure results from an inverted DNA repeat that can assemble into hairpin and cruciform structures during DNA replication. Quasipalindromes (QP), imperfect inverted repeats, are sites of mutational hotspots. Quasipalindrome-associated mutations (QPMs) occur through a template-switch mechanism in which the replicative polymerase stalls at a QP site and uses the nascent strand as a template instead of the correct template strand. This mutational event causes the QP to become a perfect or more perfect inverted repeat. Since it is not fully understood how template-switch events are stimulated or repressed, we designed a high-throughput screen to discover drugs that affect these events. QP reporters were engineered in the Escherichia coli lacZ gene to allow us to study template-switch events specifically. We tested 700 compounds from the NIH Clinical Collection through a disk diffusion assay and identified 11 positive hits. One of the hits was azidothymidine (zidovudine, AZT), a thymidine analog and DNA chain terminator. The other ten were found to be fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which induce DNA-protein crosslinks. This work shows that our screen is useful in identifying small molecules that affect quasipalindrome-associated template-switch mutations.

The ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern Ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001. Pond I (\u223C1 ha) held water for 98 days, whereas Pond II (\u223C0.25 ha) held water for 34 days. Populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated. 2. In the natural pond water, total ciliate abundance in Pond II rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7. In contrast, total abundance in Pond I began at the same level as in Pond II but increased much more slowly, reached a plateau of around 500 individuals L(\u22121), and increased again late in the hydroperiod. 3. Despite being only 500 m apart, the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition. Pond I contained 50 species compared with 70 species for Pond II, with only 24 species shared. Additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species; 88 from Pond I, 104 from Pond II, with 47 species (30%) in common. Pond II contained more mid\u2010sized ciliates (50\u2013200 \u03BCm), whereas Pond I was dominated by smaller ciliates, especially in mid\u2010May and early June. In Pond I, cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 \u00B1 4 species), followed by the partial\u2010predator exclusion enclosures (50 \u00B1 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 \u00B1 2) and in the pondwater controls (39 \u00B1 0). Differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures (perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed, Lemna, outside), and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond. 4. The physicochemical environment influenced species richness, total abundance and the number of rare species (27 in Pond II versus 13 in Pond I). Variation in ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the number of days after filling (39%) and enclosure treatment (23%). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively). Sixty\u2010five per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters: number of days after filling 27%, pH 19%, and nitrate levels 12%. Fifty\u2010two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters, of which pH was the most influential. Species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed. 5. Addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds \u2013 suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition.","publish_time":"2003-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrushchyshyn, Oksana; Magnusson, A.

Currently, no FDA approved drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of LASV fever. The LASV glycoprotein complex (GP) is a promising target for vaccine or drug development. It is situated on the virion envelope and plays key roles in LASV growth, cell tropism, host range, and pathogenicity. In an effort to discover new LASV vaccines, we employ several sequence-based computational prediction tools to identify LASV GP major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II T-cell epitopes. In addition, many sequence- and structure-based computational prediction tools were used to identify LASV GP B-cell epitopes. The predicted T- and B-cell epitopes were further filtered based on the consensus approach that resulted in the identification of thirty new epitopes that have not been previously tested experimentally. Epitope-allele complexes were obtained for selected strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes using molecular docking and the complexes were relaxed with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes. These predictions provide guidance to the experimental investigations and validation of the epitopes with the potential for stimulating T-cell responses and B-cell antibodies against LASV and allow the design and development of LASV vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baral, Prabin; Pavadai, Elumalai; Gerstman, Bernard S.; Chapagain, Prem P.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43d75c4463c98c19ac71f984c0cdba7804089971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","LASV"],"locations":["West","Central Africa"],"keyphrases":["T-cell epitopes","LASV GP B-cell epitopes","LASV growth","development of LASV vaccines","new LASV vaccines","cell tropism","T-cell responses","treatment of LASV fever","LASV glycoprotein complex","new epitopes","B-cell antibodies","LASV GP major histocompatibility complex","predicted T","Epitope-allele complexes","MHC","computational prediction tools","sequence","molecular dynamics simulations","molecular docking","drug development","Lassa virus","severe hemorrhagic fever","ambisense RNA virus","high fatality rate","key roles","humans","West","class","promising target","host range","experimental investigations","validation","interaction","structure","potential","design","guidance","Arenaviridae","FDA approved drugs","identification","Central Africa","virion envelope","predictions","pathogenicity","binding alleles","member","effort","consensus approach","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of prospectively identified CDH-infants at our centre. Data from medical records and critical information systems were obtained. Baseline data included mode of delivery and infant condition. Outcome data included 24-h, 28-day, and 1 year mortality rates and management data included intensive care treatment, length of stay in the intensive care unit, time of discharge from hospital, and surgical intervention. Descriptive analyses were performed for all variables. Survivors and non-survivors were compared for baseline and treatment data. RESULTS: Ninety-five infants were identified (44% female). Of these, 77% were left-sided hernias, 52% were diagnosed prenatally, and 6.4% had concurrent malformations. The 28-day mortality rate was 21.1%, and the 1 year mortality rate was 22.1%.

The objective of this study is to compare the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life following premedication with propofol, versus placebo (rescue with ketamine), for the LISA procedure in preterm neonates born before 32 weeks gestational age (wGA). METHODS: ProLISA is a phase III, non-inferiority, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial designed according to the SPIRIT Statement. Neonates born before 32 wGA in 12 geographically dispersed Neonatal Intensive Care Units in France needing surfactant will be included from September 2019 to September 2022. A sample of 542 patients is needed. The neonate is randomized to the intervention (propofol) or control placebo group. Open label rescue treatment with ketamine is possible in both groups if FANS (Faceless Acute Neonatal pain Scale) is \u22656. To guide drug administration, FANS is scored before attempting laryngoscopy. Once an adequate score has been obtained, LISA is performed according to a standardized protocol. The primary outcome is the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life. Secondary outcomes are tolerance of the procedure, pain evaluation, hemodynamic and neurologic parameters after the intervention, morbidities before discharge and neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial on this topic and will provide crucial information to support implementation of the LISA procedure.

Studies show the adaptive response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ineffective for complete viral elimination. Other studies describe the kinetics of the adaptive response to PRRSV, but have not investigated the early response by DCs. We hypothesize that there is an aberrant activation of DCs early in PRRSV infection; consequently, the adaptive response is triggered inadequately. The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN-\u03B1 (rpIFN-\u03B1), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN-\u03B2 mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN-\u03B1 was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN-\u03B1 addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN-\u03B1 was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators. DC response to PRRSV was limited to IFN-\u03B2 transcription, which may be inadequate in triggering the adaptive immune response.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loving, Crystal L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Sacco, Randy E","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbd2961c073744e5d4684c997a253fc145487d64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2265861.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptive response","early response","adaptive immune response","interferon anti-viral response","PRRSV infection","ability of PRRSV","DC response","rpIFN-\u03B1 addition","MDDCs","aberrant activation of DCs","anti-viral immunity","monocyte-derived DCs","viral replication","subtype of porcine lung DCs","addition of rpIFN","anti-viral mediator activation","transcription of protective anti-viral mediators","addition of recombinant porcine IFN-\u03B1","cell types","complete viral elimination","IFN-\u03B2 transcription","\u03B2 mRNA","induction of IFN","T cells","Dendritic cells","Studies","early innate protection","mRNA synthesis of Mx","PKR","respiratory syndrome virus","double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase","myxovirus resistant","initiation","antigen","duration","magnitude","important cytokine","role","kinetics","current study","distinct differentiation pathways","evidence","Results"],"language":"en"},

The recombination occurred in a non-random manner, involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy-choice mechanism during (\u002B) strand RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2007-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Bu-Jun; Symons, Robert H.; Palukaitis, Peter","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ccc18758132523e4b94a6cd392053a5b4b542cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2275080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2275080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selection of RNA","RNA recombination","acceptor RNA","strand RNA synthesis","selection of recombinants","rate of selection","recombinant RNAs","chimeric virus","virus evolution","cucumber mosaic virus","b genes","crossover site","related tomato aspermy virus","nt tandem repeat","important pathway","single nucleotide","small movement protein","copy-choice mechanism","non-random manner","intermediates","factors","source","nature","viruses"],"language":"en"},

It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the \u0022duty to treat\u0022 might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of \u0022presumed consent\u0022 on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. CONCLUSION: If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.","publish_time":"2008-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Civaner, Murat; Arda, Berna","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07abbba28dd64fdb2f811ee31e863e424229b21f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2311313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2311313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["participants","medical profession","duty of HCWs","care","moral duty","presumed consent argument","occupational risks of infectious diseases","medical aid","certain diseases","level of acceptable risk","standard level of risk","physicians","dentists","study population","training","particular risk","specific protective measures","availability of protective measures","constant level of uncertainty present","adequate knowledge","degree of knowledge","faculty education","inescapable problem","greater ability","fact","recent epidemics","social contract","SARS","cross-sectional survey","discrimination","patients","near-impossibility","society","AIDS","avian-flu","foster","beliefs","opinions","limits","justifications","notion","reasons","contextual constraints","BACKGROUND","METHODS","practice","debate","professionals","Ankara","problems","total","self-administered questionnaire","difficulty","grounds","terms","RESULTS","individual","findings","list","purpose","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Reports on natural MHV outbreaks are rare and most studies have been conducted by deliberately infecting mice with MHV laboratory strains that cause moderate to severe disturbances to the immune system. We have investigated the effects of a natural acute outbreak of MHV in our otherwise specific-pathogen-free (SPF) inbred mouse colonies, and of enzootic chronic MHV infection on cytokine production and resistance to the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi. We found that BALB/c and/or C57BL/6 SPF mice that had been injected with T. cruzi blood trypomastigotes from recently MHV-contaminated (MHV(\u002B)) mice developed significantly higher parasite blood counts, accelerated death, and showed higher IL-10 production by spleen cells than their counterparts whose T. cruzi inoculum was derived from MHV-negative (MHV(\u2212)) donors.

In contrast, T. cruzi infection of chronically MHV-infected mice did not result in major changes in the course of infection when compared with that observed in mice from MHV(\u2212) colonies, although a trend to higher parasitaemia levels was observed in BALB/c MHV(\u002B) mice. Nevertheless, both BALB/c and C57BL/6 T. cruzi-infected MHV(\u002B) mice had diminished IFN-\u03B3 production to parasite-antigen stimulation in comparison with similarly infected MHV(\u2212) mice.

Phylogenetic studies investigated this phenomenon but have lacked sequences from more subtropical and tropical regions, particularly from Southeast Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 281 complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences were obtained from influenza A(H3N2) viruses, collected over 10 years (1997\u20132006) from Hong Kong. These dated sequences were analyzed with influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere, worldwide. In addition, the NA sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring, known, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance-associated amino acid mutations (R292K and E119V). Before 2001, the Hong Kong HA and NA sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99) than did sequences from elsewhere. After 2001, this trend reversed with significant clusters containing HA and NA sequences from different locations, isolated at different times, suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza A(H3N2) seasonality during this 10-year period. However, at least one example from Hong Kong was found suggesting that in some years, influenza A(H3N2) viruses may persist in the same location, perhaps continuing to circulate, sub-clinically, at low levels between seasons, to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year, relatively unchanged. None of these Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) NA sequences contained any of the known NAI-resistance associated mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) may be largely due to global migration, with similar viruses appearing in different countries at different times. However, occasionally, some viruses may remain within a single location and continue to circulate within that population, to re-emerge during the next influenza season, with relatively little genetic change. Naturally occurring NAI resistance mutations were absent or, at least, very rare in this population.","publish_time":"2008-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Julian W.; Ngai, Karry L.

While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p\u003C0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p\u003C0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.","publish_time":"2008-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bray, Daniel P.; Bennett, Malcolm; Stockley, Paula; Hurst, Jane L.; Kipar, Anja","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5c1960487379bc9bd2cdfef08fc1b6e515abf73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2561066.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wald"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild common shrews","shrews of different ages","immune defence","natural parasites","immune system maintenance","specific immune responses","immune system functions","efficient immune responses","near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews","Studies of wild animals","natural environment","encountered parasites","native parasites","sub-adults","Wald","young animals","older animals","large numbers of offspring","natural parasitic infections","storage of large numbers of plasma cells","lymphatic follicles","haemolymphatic tissues","increased longevity","breeding season","increased survival","eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves","greater levels of depletion","signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion","investment","transmission electron microscopy","immunity","novel agents","light","Sorex araneus","short life span","type of inflammatory reactions","extent","little indication of immunosenescence","physiological traits","unique lymphoid organ","conjunction","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","shorter expected lifespans","hypothesis","pancreas of Aselli","SIGNIFICANCE","resource cost","opportunities","expectations","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","reproduction","mating","METHODOLOGY","immunohistology","composition"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the current status of PHE preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals\u0027 capacities for emergency response. The objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital PHE preparedness in China. METHODS: Four hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic data; PHE preparation; response to PHE in community; stockpiles of drugs and materials; detection and identification of PHE; procedures for medical treatment; laboratory diagnosis and management; staff training; and risk communication were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 318 (79.5%) of the 400 hospitals surveyed. Of the valid responses, 264 (85.2%) hospitals had emergency plans; 93.3% had command centres and personnel for PHE; 22.9% included community organisations during the training for PHE; 97.4% could transport needed medical staff to a PHE; 53.1% had evaluated stockpiles of drugs; 61.5% had evaluated their supply systems; 55.5% had developed surveillance systems; and 74.6% could monitor the abnormity(See in appendix). Physicians in 80.2% of the analyzed hospitals reported up-to-date knowledge of their institution\u0027s PHE protocol. Of the 318 respondents, 97.4% followed strict laboratory regulations, however, only about 33.5% had protocols for suspected samples. Furthermore, only 59.0% could isolate and identify salmonella and staphylococcus and less than 5% could isolate and identify human H5N1 avian flu and SARS. Staff training or drill programs were reported in 94.5% of the institutions; 50.3% periodically assessed the efficacy of staff training; 45% had experts to provide psychological counselling; 12.1% had provided training for their medical staff to assess PHE-related stress. All of the above capacities related to the demographic characteristics of hospitals and will be discussed in-depth in this paper. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggested that, at the time of the survey, hospital preparedness for PHE in China was at an early stage of development. Comprehensive measures should be taken to enhance hospital capacity in the prevention and management of PHE.","publish_time":"2008-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xingming; Huang, Jianshi; Zhang, Hui","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbe3b4ffcd47171f3beb270e88c78625e3c42c4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2567325.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHE","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of PHE","PHE preparation","identification of PHE","PHE-related stress","current status of PHE preparedness","current status of hospital PHE preparedness","institution\u0027s PHE protocol","Hospital preparedness","medical staff","efficacy of staff training","analyzed hospitals","hospital demographic data","hospital capacity","demographic characteristics of hospitals","emergency response","early detection","management of public health emergency","medical treatment","emergency plans","provinces of China","stockpiles of drugs","survey","Valid responses","laboratory diagnosis","community organisations","hospitals\u0027 capacities","surveillance systems","supply systems","early stage of development","strict laboratory regulations","procedures","up-to-date knowledge","materials","planning","step","command centres","human H5N1 avian flu","SARS","experts","time","prevention","risk communication","study","personnel","BACKGROUND","drill programs","psychological counselling","protocols","suspected samples","respondents","standardized questionnaire","RESULTS","Comprehensive measures","abnormity","appendix","salmonella","staphylococcus","paper","objective","Physicians","CONCLUSION","METHODS","institutions"],"language":"en"},

Recombination has been observed to contribute to this process by generating novel genetic variants. Although distinctive recombination patterns have been described in many viral pathogens, little is known about the influence of biases in the recombination process itself relative to selective forces acting on newly formed recombinants. Understanding these influences is important for determining how recombination contributes to pathogen genome and proteome evolution. Most previous research on recombination-driven protein evolution has focused on relatively simple proteins, usually in the context of directed evolution experiments. Here, we study recombination in the envelope gene of HIV-1 between primary isolates belonging to subtypes that recombine naturally in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. By characterizing the early steps in the generation of recombinants, we provide novel insights into the evolutionary forces that shape recombination patterns within viral populations. Specifically, we show that the combined effects of mechanistic processes that determine the locations of recombination breakpoints across the HIV-1 envelope gene, and purifying selection acting against dysfunctional recombinants, can explain almost the entire distribution of breakpoints found within this gene in nature. These constraints account for the surprising paucity of recombination breakpoints found in infected individuals within this highly variable gene. Thus, the apparent randomness of HIV evolution via recombination may in fact be relatively more predictable than anticipated. In addition, the dominance of purifying selection in localized areas of the HIV genome defines regions where functional constraints on recombinants appear particularly strong, pointing to vulnerable aspects of HIV biology.","publish_time":"2009-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Galetto, Roman; Hamoudi, Meriem; Archer, John; Lefeuvre, Pierre; Martin, Darren P.; Robertson, David L.; Negroni, Matteo","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74f823e968a2920c96c87977da7289f5363979da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2671596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombination process","locations of recombination breakpoints","shape recombination patterns","distinctive recombination patterns","HIV genome","recombination-driven protein evolution","envelope gene of HIV","surprising paucity of recombination breakpoints","apparent randomness of HIV evolution","proteome evolution","generation of recombinants","formed recombinants","dysfunctional recombinants","variable gene","vulnerable aspects of HIV biology","viral pathogens","context of directed evolution experiments","dominance of purifying selection","entire distribution of breakpoints","evolutionary forces","selective forces","functional constraints","pathogen genome","novel insights","constraints account","viral populations","ability of pathogens","influence of biases","novel genetic variants","localized areas","regions","infected individuals","host\u0027s immune response","establishment of persistent infections","previous research","combined effects of mechanistic processes","fact","simple proteins","primary isolates","early steps","addition","subtypes","virulence","AIDS pandemic","influences","nature"],"language":"en"},

Because the list of \u03B3-secretase substrates is growing quickly and this enzyme is a cancer and Alzheimer\u0027s disease therapeutic target, the mapping of \u03B3-secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes and molecular functions transcriptionally affected by \u03B3-secretase activity, the cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced and inhibited \u03B3-secretase activity were analyzed and compared by cDNA microarray. The functional clustering by FatiGO of the 1,981 identified genes revealed over- and under-represented groups with multiple activities and functions. Single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to \u03B3-secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the 21 validated genes, the strikingly decreased transcription of PTPRG and AMN1 and increased transcription of UPP1 potentially support data on cell cycle disturbances relevant to cancer, stem cell and neurodegenerative diseases\u0027 research. The mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data and revealed broad effects on Wnt pathway members, including WNT3A and DVL3. Intriguingly, the transcription of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is affected by \u03B3-secretase activity and was significantly altered in the analyzed human Alzheimer\u0027s disease brain cortices. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Investigating the effects of \u03B3-secretase activity on gene transcription has revealed several affected clusters of molecular functions and, more specifically, 21 genes that hold significant potential for a better understanding of the biology of \u03B3-secretase and its roles in cancer and Alzheimer\u0027s disease pathology.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magold, Alexandra I.; Cacquevel, Matthias; Fraering, Patrick C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79316a90d0cd339b0d8d40407555b253994fd833.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2739295.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TERA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibited \u03B3-secretase activity","effects of \u03B3","mapping of \u03B3","secretase substrates","secretase activity susceptible gene transcription","biology of \u03B3","transcription of different genes","list of \u03B3","validated genes","identified genes","Single genes","transcription of TERA","view of specific affected genes","cancer","affected clusters of molecular functions","increased transcription of UPP1","decreased transcription of PTPRG","Alzheimer\u0027s disease pathology","Alzheimer\u0027s disease therapeutic target","analyzed human Alzheimer\u0027s disease brain cortices","gene of unknown function","stem cell","broad effects","biological processes","mapping of interactions","biological pathways","diverse array of cellular","evidence-based data","cell cycle disturbances relevant","membrane protein substrates triggers","cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary","under-represented groups","CHO","cascades","cells","Wnt pathway members","pronounced transcriptional susceptibility","AMN1","type","roles","multiple activities","ICDs","better understanding","neurodegenerative diseases\u0027 research","intracellular domains","WNT3A","FatiGO","significant potential","proteins","enzyme","nuclear translocation","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","DVL3","SIGNIFICANCE","real-time PCR","BACKGROUND","Processing","functional clustering","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","cDNA microarray"],"language":"en"},

Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.","publish_time":"2009-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miranda, Patricia V.; Allaire, Alicia; Sosnik, Julian; Visconti, Pablo E.","journal":"Biology of Reproduction","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cbc71c13d33818568327dbe07aba209549aea2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2804839.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/80/5/897/10571849/biolreprod0897.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IZUMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sperm incubation","reacted sperm","sperm head","sperm membranes","Mammalian sperm","acrosome reaction","identity of sperm proteins","flotillin","multiple sperm domains","sperm-egg membrane interaction","equatorial segment of acrosome","IZUMO","glucose transporter","caveolin","membrane rafts","TEX101","capacitation","membrane raft dynamics","changes","basigin","molecules","ganglioside GM3","cholesterol loss","acrosomal cap","cholesterol efflux","previous study","para-acrosomal areas","movement of lipid raft microdomains","role","midpiece","immunofluorescence pattern","capacitating conditions","cytoplasmic droplet","biophysical properties","ultracentrifugation","process","laboratory","results","light buoyant-density fractions","hexokinase","behavior","fusogenic","polyacrylamide gels","extent","sucrose gradients","principal piece","requirement","Triton X","Different laboratories","markers","subset","SPAM1","consideration","occurrence","extraction","localization"],"language":"en"},

The sequence of events that leads to release of filovirus particles from cells is poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed, one proceeding via a \u201Csubmarine-like\u201D budding with the helical nucleocapsid emerging parallel to the plasma membrane, and the other via perpendicular \u201Crocket-like\u201D protrusion. Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape. They reconcile the contrasting models of filovirus budding and allow us to describe the sequence of events taking place during budding and release of Marburg virus.

METHODS: A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as intervention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a community. RESULTS: We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduction numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P\u0026I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age \u003E64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P\u0026I mortality data of the elderly (\u003E64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d3e6c56ef64eb7705fbed676eddcfa8af8ef65f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2876165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2876165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of vaccination","elderly mortality","active age groups","age-specific vaccination","asymptomatic influenza infections","relative impact","lack of impact","devastating impact","vaccination data","mortality data","pronounced impact","impact of younger","model fit","susceptible elderly","asymptomatic infection","pH1N1 influenza pandemic","effective reproduction numbers","basic reproduction number","Taiwan winter influenza season","relevant reproduction numbers","asymptomatic infectives","compartmental model","disease transmission","Pre-symptomatic infections","need","winter flu season","disease incidence","winter school closings","community","various intervention measures","school settings","relative inactivity","pandemic preparedness planning","contact transmission probability","simulations of possible future scenarios","larger role","modeling studies","little effect","morbidity-based strategy","unpredictable nature","close contacts","evidence","interventions","caretakers","vulnerability","order","overall transmissibility","large errors","METHODS","Pneumonia","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","illustration","change","households"],"language":"en"},

Besides its direct microbicidal activity, HOCl can react with amino acid residues and HOCl-modified proteins can be detected in vivo. FINDINGS: This report is based on binding studies of HOCl-modified serum albumins to HIV-1 gp120 and three different neutralization assays using infectious virus. The binding studies were carried out by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and by standard ELISA techniques. Virus neutralization assays were carried out using HIV-1 NL4-3 virus and recombinant strains with CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptor usage. Viral infection was monitored by a standard p24 or X-gal staining assay. Our data demonstrate that HOCl-modified mouse-, bovine- and human serum albumins all bind to the HIV-1 NL4-3 gp120 (LAV) glycoprotein in contrast to non-modified albumin. Binding of HOCl-modified albumin to gp120 correlated to the blockade of CD4 as well as that of V3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding. In neutralization experiments, HOCl-modified serum albumins inhibited replication and syncytium formation of the X4- and R5-tropic NL4-3 isolates in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that HOCl-modified serum albumin veils the binding site for CD4 and the V3 loop on gp120. Such masking of the viral gp120/gp41 envelope complex might be a simple but promising strategy to inactivate HIV-1 and therefore prevent infection when HOCl-modified serum albumin is applied, for example, as a topical microbicide.","publish_time":"2010-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Polzer, Svenja; van Yperen, Melanie; Kirst, Martin; Schwalbe, Birco; Schaal, Heiner; Schreiber, Michael","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1831b9b4ecd716560e565ea11c0ad1a01dbc9314.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2887905.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Binding of HOCl","HOCl-modified serum albumins","HOCl-modified mouse","HOCl-modified proteins","binding studies of HOCl","non-modified albumin","HIV","viral gp120","human serum albumins","binding site","Virus neutralization assays","V3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding","different neutralization assays","neutralization experiments","infectious virus","Viral infection","data","microbicidal activity of neutrophils","R5-tropic NL4","direct microbicidal activity","standard p24","hypochlorous acid","blockade of CD4","amino acid residues","standard ELISA techniques","replication","recombinant strains","isolates","CXCR4","X4","surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy","syncytium formation","glycoprotein","contrast","bovine","gp41 envelope complex","important element","LAV","X-gal staining assay","CCR5 coreceptor usage","example","promising strategy","dose dependent manner","Myeloperoxidase","report","masking","chloride","BACKGROUND","topical microbicide","CONCLUSIONS","body fluids","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Biochanin A, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma and the active isoflavone in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus could be used as an influenza treatment.

Here we report that BTV-1 infection of BHK cells is also dependent on a low endosomal pH; however, virus entry and infection were not inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of Eps15, AP180 or the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2, which were shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, infection was not inhibited by depletion of cellular cholesterol, which suggests that virus entry is not mediated by a lipid-raft dependent process such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Although virus entry and infection were not inhibited by the dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant, entry was inhibited by the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, indicating that virus entry is dynamin dependent. During entry, BTV-1 co-localised with LAMP-1 but not with transferrin, suggesting that virus is delivered to late-endosomal compartments without first passing through early-endosomes. BTV-1 entry and infection were inhibited by EIPA and cytochalasin-D, known macropinocytosis inhibitors, and during entry virus co-localised with dextran, a known marker for macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake.

Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest. This strategy will result in earlier detection of pathogens and a reduction in the impact of future pandemics.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosseini, Parviez; Sokolow, Susanne H.; Vandegrift, Kurt J.; Kilpatrick, A.

Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.","publish_time":"2010-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazmi, Arshed; Dutta, Kallol; Basu, Anirban","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd5e3020671499cde830bd25de618009ece0af13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2990691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["following Morpholino treatment","viral genome","viral replication","reduced viral load","viral protein expression","brain homogenates","murine model of JE","experimental model of JE","Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino","infective viral particle production","anti-sense molecules","thionin staining of brain sections","increased survival of animals","greater survival of infected animals","adjoining regions","untranslated regions of JEV genome","neuroprotective effect","specific regions","uncharged anti-sense oligomers","intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos","immunohistochemical staining","protein extraction","significant antiviral","certain stress","Oxidative stress","nuclear compartment of cells","cells of living organisms","potential antiviral agent","reduction","levels of proinflammatory cytokines","neuroprotection","Mice","analysis","GP78 strain","endosomes","endocytosis","cytosol","Cytokine bead array","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","flavivirus","evaluation","BACKGROUND","Japanese encephalitis","therapeutic interventions","mosquito","SIGNIFICANCE","Plaque assay","dreaded encephalitides","world","effective way","CONCLUSIONS","brains","days","microglial activation","body weight","death","Survivability","infection","treatments","studies"],"language":"en"},

These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.","publish_time":"2010-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomankova, Tereza; Petrek, Martin; Kriegova, Eva","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b97de55ba907c3b1f3048bfecf6b2b3970363541.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3001429.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Drosha/Pasha"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of miRNAs","human pulmonary diseases","function of miRNAs","involvement of miRNAs","mature miRNAs","MiRNAs play role","lung development","human genes","pulmonary physiological conditions","development of various pulmonary diseases","pathological processes","miRNA expression profiles","lung cancerogenesis","lung compartment","regulation of diverse physiological processes","abnormal miRNA expression","fibrotic processes","human genome","current knowledge","smoking-related diseases","degradation of target mRNAs","posttranscriptional regulation of key genes","fundamental biological processes","pathological conditions","current state","current research","review","larger precursor molecules","single-stranded RNA molecules","immune system","association","strong potential","apoptosis","developmental timing","evidence","Pasha","Dicer","contribution","different microRNA","mechanism","ribonucleases Drosha","homeostasis","hairpin structures","date","studies"],"language":"en"},

Background. Lack of life-long immunity against influenza viruses represents a major global health care problem with profound medical and economic consequences. A greater understanding of the broad-spectrum \u201Cheterosubtypic\u201D neutralizing human antibody (BnAb) response to influenza should bring us closer toward a universal influenza vaccine. Methods. Serum samples obtained from 77 volunteers in an H5N1 vaccine study were analyzed for cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) against both subtype hemagglutinins (HAs) and a highly conserved pocket on the HA stem of Group 1 viruses. Cross-reactive Abs in commercial intravenous immunoglobulin were affinity purified using H5-coupled beads followed by step-wise monoclonal antibody competition or acid elution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify cross-binding, and neutralization activity was determined with HA-pseudotyped viruses. Results. Prevaccination serum samples have detectable levels of heterosubtypic HA binding activity to both Group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5 and H7, respectively, to which study subjects had not been vaccinated. Two different populations of Broadly neutralizing Abs (BnAbs) were purified from intravenous immunoglobulin by H5 beads: \u223C0.01% of total immunoglobulin G can bind to HAs from both Group 1 and 2 and neutralize H1N1 and H5N1 viruses; \u223C0.001% is F10-like Abs directed against the HA stem pocket on Group 1 viruses. Conclusion. These data\u2014to our knowledge, for the first time\u2014quantitatively show the presence, albeit at low levels, of two populations of heterosubtypic BnAbs against influenza A in human serum. These observations warrant further investigation to determine their origin, host polymorphism(s) that may affect their expression levels and how to boost these BnAb responses by vaccination to reach sustainable protective levels.","publish_time":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sui, Jianhua; Sheehan, Jared; Hwang, William C.; Bankston, Laurie A.; Burchett, Sandra K.; Huang, Chiung-Yu; Liddington, Robert C.; Beigel, John H.; Marasco, Wayne A.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fc9e0063dec8136011699801c87c04ad703db89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3070035.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/52/8/1003/810545/cir121.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background","Abs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","H5N1 viruses","HA-pseudotyped viruses","HA stem of Group","Cross-reactive Abs","neutralizing Abs","detectable levels of heterosubtypic HA binding activity","HA stem pocket","universal influenza vaccine","H5 beads","low levels","expression levels","human serum","populations of heterosubtypic BnAbs","human antibody","commercial intravenous immunoglobulin","sustainable protective levels","subtypes H5","Prevaccination serum samples","H5N1 vaccine study","total immunoglobulin G","neutralization activity","cross-binding","cross-reactive antibodies","BnAb responses","different populations","conserved pocket","study subjects","step-wise monoclonal antibody competition","major global health care problem","affinity","long immunity","acid elution","volunteers","economic consequences","Donis","Cox","origin","Lack of life","H7","host polymorphism","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","investigation","editorial commentary","greater understanding","presence","H1N1","subtype hemagglutinins","knowledge","time","pages","F10","data","observations","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to describe the perceptions of nurses with SARS in Hong Kong, as the perceptions of nurses who have suffered from SARS have not been studied. Ten nurses who had suffered from SARS were interviewed, either face\u2010to\u2010face or by telephone, about their subjective experiences. These interviews provided in\u2010depth, descriptive data, which were analysed using content analysis. Nine broad categories were identified: uncertainty, information control, feelings of anger and guilt, lack of preparation and fear of death, feelings of isolation and loneliness, physical effects, support, change of perspective of life, and change of perspective of nursing. Although the dreaded disease affected the nurses tremendously, both physically and psychologically, it has also had its positive side.

Epidemiologically, COPD exacerbations exhibit seasonal patterns peaking at year-end. We examined whether the use of a BlackBerry-based daily symptom diary would detect 95% or more of exacerbations and enable characterization of seasonal differences among them. Methods Fifty participants with GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage I to IV COPD began a community-based study in December 2007. Another 30 began in December 2008. Participants transmitted daily symptom diaries using a BlackBerry. Alerts were triggered when symptom changes, missed diary transmissions, or medical care for a respiratory problem occurred. Participant encounters were initiated if COPD exacerbations were suspected. Participants used their BlackBerrys to report returns to normal breathing. Results Participants transmitted 99.9% of 28,514 possible daily diaries. All 191 (2.5/participant-year) COPD exacerbations meeting Anthonisen criteria were detected. During 148 of the 191 exacerbations (78%, 1.97/participant-year), patients were hospitalized and/or ordered prednisone, an antibiotic, or both. Respiratory viruses were detected in 78 of the 191 exacerbations (41%). Those coinciding with a respiratory viral infection averaged 12.0 days, and those without averaged 8.9 days (P \u003C .04), with no difference in Anthonisen score. Respiratory symptom scores before exacerbations and after normal breathing return showed no differences. Exacerbations were more frequent during the Christmas period than the rest of the year but were not more frequent than in the rest of winter alone. Conclusions Smartphone-based collection of COPD symptom diaries enables near-complete identification of exacerbations at inception. Exacerbation rates in the Christmas season do not reach levels that necessitate changes in disease management.","publish_time":"2013-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnston, Neil W.; Lambert, Kim; Hussack, Patricia; de Verdier, Maria Gerhardsson; Higenbottam, Tim; Lewis, Jonathan; Newbold, Paul; Jenkins, Martin; Norman, Geoffrey R.; Coyle, Peter V.; McIvor, R.

We previously reported that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E) infection can alleviate the BST2 tethering of HIV\u20101 virions by downregulating cell surface BST2, suggesting that coronaviruses are capable of encoding anti\u2010BST2 factors. Here we report our new finding that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein, similar to Vpu, is capable of antagonizing the BST2 tethering of SARS\u2010CoV, HCoV\u2010229E, and HIV\u20101 virus\u2010like particles via BST2 downregulation. However, unlike Vpu (which downmodulates BST2 by means of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways), BST2 downregulation is apparently mediated by SARS\u2010CoV S through the lysosomal degradation pathway only. We found that SARS\u2010CoV S colocalized with both BST2 and reduced cell surface BST2, suggesting an association between SARS\u2010CoV S and BST2 that targets the lysosomal degradation pathway. According to one recent report, SARS\u2010CoV ORF7a antagonizes BST2 by interfering with BST2 glycosylation(1). Our data provide support for the proposal that SARS\u2010CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving supplementary anti\u2010BST2 factors in a manner that requires virus replication.

Here, we expanded the study through small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits. We observed differential expression of over 200 small RNAs of diverse classes during infection. A majority of identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showed divergent changes in expression across mouse strains with respect to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections and responded differently to a highly pathogenic reconstructed 1918 virus compared to a minimally pathogenic seasonal influenza virus isolate. Novel insights into miRNA expression changes, including the association with pathogenic outcomes and large differences between in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, were further elucidated by a survey of selected miRNAs across diverse virus infections. The small RNAs identified also included many non-miRNA small RNAs, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), in addition to nonannotated small RNAs. An integrative sequencing analysis of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples showed that the results revealing differential expression of miRNAs during infection were largely due to transcriptional regulation and that the predicted miRNA-mRNA network could modulate global host responses to virus infection in a combinatorial fashion. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the response of host small RNAs to virus infection and show that small RNAs are an integrated component of complex networks involved in regulating the host response to infection.","publish_time":"2011-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Xinxia; Gralinski, Lisa; Ferris, Martin T.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Thomas, Matthew J.; Proll, Sean; Korth, Marcus J.; Tisoncik, Jennifer R.; Heise, Mark; Luo, Shujun; Schroth, Gary P.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Li, Chengjun; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/602981d75e74595af0e2de9e046a9cc9e05a1c0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3221602.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22086488/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00198-11","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["response of host small RNAs","small nucleolar RNAs","nonannotated small RNAs","non-miRNA small RNAs","small RNAs of diverse classes","influenza virus infections","diverse virus infections","pathogenic seasonal influenza virus","differential expression of miRNAs","small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis","miRNA expression changes","widespread differential expression of long non-protein-coding RNAs","integrated sequencing analysis","integrative sequencing analysis","SARS-CoV","founder mouse strains","global host responses","pathogenic outcomes","survey of selected miRNAs","recombinant inbred mouse resource","divergent changes","predicted miRNA-mRNA network","long transcripts","integrated component of complex networks","mapping complex traits","majority of identified microRNAs","Collaborative Cross","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","association","ncRNAs","respect","large differences","snoRNAs","study","addition","samples","transcriptional regulation","Novel insights","results","combinatorial fashion","findings","experimental systems"],"language":"en"},

By optimizing the flotation parameters at slurry concentration 0.05kg/l, kerosene dosage 12kg/t, frother dosage 3kg/t and air flow rate 0.06m3/h, 92.7% of the carbon constituents were removed from the raw fly ash. Under these conditions, the froth product has LOI of 56.35% and calorific values of 12.5MJ/kg, LOI in the tailings was below 5%, and the total toxic equivalent (TEQ) of PCDD/Fs decreased from 5.61ng-TEQ/g in the raw fly ash to 1.47ng-TEQ/g in the tailings. The results show that column flotation is a potential technology for simultaneous separation of carbon constituents and PCDD/Fs from HSWI fly ash.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Hanqiao; Wei, Guoxia; Zhang, Rui","journal":"Waste Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b84e46f8f48ceda3f3cb0660870208907c9fd64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127196.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X12004096; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X12004096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23046874/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.08.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCDD","LOI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSWI fly ash","raw fly ash","removal of carbon constituents","PCDD","unburned carbon","Fs","simultaneous separation of carbon constituents","large number of carbon constituents","LOI","ng-TEQ","main flotation parameters","column flotation","results","tailings","frother dosage","kerosene dosage","froth product","final product","powder","potential technology","Abstract Hospital solid waste incinerator","dioxins","major source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p","air flow rate","dibenzofurans","ignition","06m3","effects","total toxic equivalent","slurry concentration","calorific values","MJ","conditions","loss","characteristics","study","conditioning process"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV) were considered the major causative agents. Lately, new pathogens have been implicated in the development of CIRDC, namely canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. To better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of CIRDC and their epidemiological relevance in Europe, prevalence data were collected from peer-reviewed publications and summarized. Evidence of exposure to Bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs. Co-infections with viral pathogens are common. The findings confirm that Bb is an important cause of CIRDC in Europe. CAV-2 and CDV recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination. Seroconversion to CHV can be demonstrated following CIRDC outbreaks and CHV has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs. There is some evidence that CHV is not a primary cause of CIRDC, but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease. The currently available data suggest that CIV is, at present, neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in Europe. CPiV remains an important pathogen in CIRDC and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens. CnPnV and CRCoV are important new elements in the aetiology of CIRDC and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments. M. cynos is common in Europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs. This organism is frequently found together with other CIRDC pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs. S. zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels. Protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete, and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination. However, even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages. They reduce spread, increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials. Recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of CIRDC will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, M.

A recently developed platform that couples broad-range PCR amplification of pathogen DNA with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has the ability to identify virtually any microorganism from direct clinical specimens. To date, two clinical evaluations of the PCR/ESI-MS technology for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood have been published. Here we discuss them and describe recent improvements that result in an enhanced sensitivity. Other commercially available assays for the molecular diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood are also reviewed.

Alphavirus MD erase ribosylation but their precise contribution in viral replication is still under investigation. NMR-driven titration experiments of ADPr in solution with the VEEV macro domain (in apo- and complex state) show that it adopts a suitable conformation for ADPr binding. Specific experiments indicate that the flexibility of the loops \u03B25-\u03B13 and \u03B13-\u03B26 is critical for formation of the complex and assists a wrapping mechanism for ADPr binding.

METHOD: A focused literature review was undertaken, partly informed by a forthcoming report on environment, agriculture and infectious diseases of poverty, facilitated by the Special Programme for Tropical Diseases. RESULTS: More than ten categories of infectious disease emergence exist, but none formally analyse past, current or future burden of disease. Other evidence suggests that the dominant public health concern focuses on two informal groupings. Most important is the perceived threat of newly recognised infections, especially viruses that arise or are newly discovered in developing countries that originate in species exotic to developed countries, such as non-human primates, bats and rodents. These pathogens may be transmitted by insects or bats, or via direct human contact with bushmeat. The second group is new strains of influenza arising from intensively farmed chickens or pigs, or emerging from Asian \u201Cwet markets\u201D where several bird species have close contact. Both forms appear justified because of two great pandemics: HIV/AIDS (which appears to have originated from bushmeat hunting in Africa before emerging globally) and Spanish influenza, which killed up to 2.5% of the human population around the end of World War I. Insufficiently appreciated is the contribution of the milieu which appeared to facilitate the high disease burden in these pandemics. Additionally, excess anxiety over emerging infectious diseases diverts attention from issues of greater public health importance, especially: (i) existing (including neglected) infectious diseases and (ii) the changing milieu that is eroding the determinants of immunity and public health, caused by adverse global environmental changes, including climate change and other components of stressed life and civilisation-supporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: The focus on novel pathogens and minor forms of anti-microbial resistance in emerging disease literature is unjustified by their burden of disease, actual and potential, and diverts attention from far more important health problems and determinants. There is insufficient understanding of systemic factors that promote pandemics. Adverse global change could generate circumstances conducive to future pandemics with a high burden of disease, arising via anti-microbial and insecticidal resistance, under-nutrition, conflict, and public health breakdown.","publish_time":"2012-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, Colin D","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4209267ef4da6a8206733929e58967faebf8a5b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3710192.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-9957-1-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23849217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["emerging infectious diseases","future burden of disease","emerging disease literature","future pandemics","high disease burden","high burden of disease","infectious diseases of poverty","public health breakdown","major future human pandemics","categories of infectious disease emergence","dominant public health concern","Tropical Diseases","great pandemics","important health problems","human population","issues of greater public health importance","Adverse global change","direct human contact","adverse global environmental changes","attention","non-human primates","bats","minor forms of anti-microbial resistance","insecticidal resistance","climate change","bird species","novel pathogens","species exotic","developing countries","determinants of immunity","close contact","Spanish influenza","bushmeat hunting","changing milieu","focused literature review","new strains of influenza","conflict","under-nutrition","circumstances conducive","agriculture","components of stressed life","excess anxiety","recognised infections","civilisation","perceived threat","wet markets","end of World War","HIV","Special Programme","rodents","potential","insufficient understanding of systemic factors","farmed chickens","forthcoming report","informal groupings","pigs","systems","Africa","METHOD","CONCLUSIONS","insects","AIDS","past","evidence","viruses","contribution","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanisms by which ALVAC initiates the immune response have not been completely elucidated. In order to determine the type of innate immunity triggered by ALVAC, we characterized the gene expression profile of human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon ALVAC infection. These cells are permissive to poxvirus infection and play a key role in the initiation of immune responses. The majority of the genes that were up-regulated by ALVAC belong to the type I interferon signaling pathway including IRF7, STAT1, RIG-1, and MDA-5. Genes involved in the NF-\u03BAB pathway were not up-regulated. The gene encoding for the chemokine CXCL10, a direct target of the transcription factor IRF3 was among those up-regulated and DC secretion of CXCL10 following exposure to ALVAC was confirmed by ELISA. Many downstream type I interferon activated genes with anti-viral activity (PKR, Mx, ISG15 and OAS among others) were also up-regulated in response to ALVAC. Among these, ISG15 expression in its unconjugated form by Western blot analysis was demonstrated. In view of these results we propose that ALVAC induces type I interferon anti-viral innate immunity via a cytosolic pattern-recognition-receptor (PRR) sensing double-stranded DNA, through activation of IRF3 and IRF7. These findings may aid in the design of more effective ALVAC-vectored vaccines.","publish_time":"2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harenberg, Anke; Guillaume, Florine; Ryan, Elizabeth J.; Burdin, Nicolas; Spada, Franca","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaca4d1f48201c3ad99d6156490cd6156b1d34b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115550.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08009857; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08009857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18691624/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALVAC","OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALVAC infection","effective ALVAC-vectored vaccines","recombinant canarypox virus ALVAC","genes","type of innate immunity","downstream type","interferon anti-viral innate immunity","ISG15 expression","IRF7","anti-viral activity","dendritic cells","vaccine vector","activation of IRF3","poxvirus infection","chemokine CXCL10","gene expression profile of human monocyte","transcription factor IRF3","DC secretion of CXCL10","initiation of immune responses","NF-\u03BAB pathway","development of new vaccine strategies","PRR","PKR","cytosolic pattern-recognition","chronic infectious diseases","receptor","sensing double-stranded DNA","direct target","unconjugated form","Mx","MDDCs","key role","exposure","Western blot analysis","cancer","RIG","design","STAT1","OAS","results","ELISA","order","mechanisms","view","MDA","findings","majority"],"language":"en"},

The silver gene gives rise to eight different splicing variants of differing length that can contain up to three homologous repeats. Among the protein variants encoded, the short form 1B alias DmCPD1Bs (D . melanogaster CPD variant 1B short) is necessary and sufficient for viability of the fruit fly. It has one single repeat, it is active against standard peptide substrates, and it is localized to the secretory pathway. In this work, the enzyme was found as a monomer in solution and as a homodimer in the crystal structure, which features a protomer with an N-terminal 311-residue catalytic domain of \u03B1/\u03B2-hydrolase fold and a C-terminal 84-residue all-\u03B2 transthyretin-like domain. Overall, DmCPD1Bs conforms to the structure of N/E-type funnelins/M14B metallopeptidases, but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity: (i) two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes, thus providing control through localization, and (ii) a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation. Given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent N/E-type funnelins found in higher vertebrates, DmCPD1Bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian CPs.","publish_time":"2010-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanco, Sebasti\u00E1n; Arolas, Joan L.; Guevara, Tibisay; Lorenzo, Julia; Avil\u00E9s, Francesc X.; Gomis-R\u00FCth, F.

Not every neurologic problem stems from a primary brain injury: confusion, impaired consciousness that evolves to stupor and coma, and headaches are frequent in hypercapnic/hypoxic encephalopathies. In patients with chronic pulmonary disorders, acute symptomatic seizures have been reported in acute respiratory failure in 6%. The clinician should be aware of the various EEG patterns in hypercapnic/hypoxic and anoxic (post-cardiac arrest syndrome) encephalopathies as well as encephalitides. In this emerging pandemic of infectious disease, single-use subdermal EEG needle electrodes may be used in comatose patients. Full EEG montages using the 10-20 system, including a derivation for ECG, are strongly recommended so as to cover relevant temporal lobe regions. We recommend noting whether the patient is undergoing or has been placed prone, as well as noting the body and head position during the EEG recording (supine versus prone) to avoid overinterpretation of respiratory, head movement, electrode, muscle or other artifacts. There is slight elevation of intracranial pressure in the prone position. In non-comatose patients, the hyperventilation procedure should be avoided.

The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This research was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multi epitope vaccine was built using HTLs and CTLs epitopes from 3CL hydrolase protein along with adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and Interferon-\u03B3 inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multi epitope vaccine was found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and cover large human population worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated and refined by different programs to achieve high-quality 3D structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of vaccine to elicit an immune response.

The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 32 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Ten countries \u2013 including the USA, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan \u2013 contributed to more than 80% of these publications; nation-specific research priorities focusing on the current problems in the respective country can be estimated.

Since the mid-1970s, the country has been plagued by two epizootics that claimed thousands of casualties among the indigenous kudu population. Reasons as to why kudus appear to be exceptionally susceptible to the disease still remain speculative at best. Because the Namibian economy relies heavily on trophy hunting, game meat hunting, and ecotourism, the current severe spread of rabies among kudus calls for effective measures to protect these antelopes. Oral vaccination of kudus may offer a possibility provided efficacious oral rabies vaccines are available. In this screening study, we explored options for attractive baits that facilitate optimal vaccine uptake by the target species and a bait distribution system that maximizes bait availability to the target species meanwhile minimizing bait depletion by non-target species. The results show that gelatin-based baits mixed with local (pods of the camel thorn tree) but also imported (apple-flavored corn meal) attractants are highly attractive for kudus providing a basis for future oral rabies vaccine baits.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was completed by 942 students at a university campus in Suwon, Korea, between December 1 and 8, 2009. The survey included questions regarding individual perceptions, motivating factors, and behaviors associated with hand washing for the prevention of H1N1 influenza transmission. RESULTS: Compared to one year prior, 30.3% of participants reported increasing their hand washing frequency. Female students were more likely to practice more frequent hand washing. Women also perceived the effectiveness of hand washing to be lower, and illness severity and personal susceptibility to H1N1 infection to be higher. Study participants who were female (OR: 1.79-3.90) who perceived of hand washing to be effective (OR: 1.34-12.15) and illness severity to be greater (OR: 1.00-3.12) washed their hands more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Korean students increased their frequency of hand hygiene practices during the pandemic, with significant gender differences existing in the attitudes and behaviors related to the use of hand hygiene as a means of disease prevention. Here, the factors that affected hand washing behavior were similar to those identified at the beginning of the H1N1 or SARS pandemics, suggesting that public education campaigns regarding hand hygiene are effective in altering individual hand hygiene habits during the peak periods of influenza transmission.","publish_time":"2010-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jae-Hyun; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Son, Dae-Yong; Kim, Seon-Ung; Ha, Chang-Min","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40a30eb6f76c29d52d4ee9c7619f9f8bbfef796a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2922213.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hand washing frequency","use of hand washing","effectiveness of hand washing","hand washing behavior","frequent hand washing","use of hand hygiene","individual hand hygiene habits","frequency of hand hygiene practices","prevention of H1N1 influenza transmission","behaviors","H1N1 infection","motivating factors","Female students","peak periods of influenza transmission","individual perceptions","illness severity","Korean students","Study participants","peak pandemic period","means of disease prevention","cross-sectional survey questionnaire","public education campaigns","personal susceptibility","SARS pandemics","attitudes","questions","significant gender differences","beginning","university campus","Suwon","year prior","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Women","BACKGROUND","hands"],"language":"en"},

However, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, endosomal escape. Currently, vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged siRNA. Unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. Here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) for siRNA docking and a pH-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. The protein selectively tags along the siRNA block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. More interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the RNA binding function of dsRBD.","publish_time":"2013-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Hong Yan; Gao, Xiaohu","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ea02beeb65f975de027e3b6fedc6b239e9f2e8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3819613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196104/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep03129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeted delivery of siRNA","siRNA docking","siRNA-aptamer chimeras","siRNA block of individual chimera","targeted delivery approaches","vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles","simple protein tag","RNA binding function of dsRBD","promising approaches","diblock RNA structure","efficient RNA interference","large complexes","functionalities of chimera","endosomal membrane","endosomal escape","dsRNA binding domain","pH-dependent polyhistidine","c-terminal polyhistidine segment","poor targeting ligand orientation","colloidal instability","unfavorable surface charges","lower cost","heterogeneous sizes","deep tissue penetration","functional domains","overall size","amino acids","RNAi","modularity","cationic materials","outstanding potential","clinical translation","target recognition","formulations","development","additional challenges"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies exploring CAM use among cancer patients in the Middle East region have shown discrepant results. This study investigates the prevalence and pattern of CAM use by Saudi cancer patients. It also discusses the possible benefits and harm related to CAM use by cancer patients, and it explores the beliefs patients hold and their transparency with health care providers regarding their CAM use. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in oncology wards and outpatient clinics by using face-to-face interviews with the participants. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients with a median age of 50 years (18\u201384) participated in the study. The prevalence of CAM use was 69.9%; the most prominent types of CAM were those of a religious nature, such as supplication (95.4%), Quran recitation (88.1%), consuming Zamzam water (84.4%), and water upon which the Quran has been read (63.3%). Drinking camel milk was reported by 24.1% of CAM users, whereas camel urine was consumed by 15.7%. A variety of reasons were given for CAM use: 75% reported that they were using CAM to treat cancer, enhance mood (18.3%),control pain (11.9%), enhance the immune system (11%),increase physical fitness (6.4%), and improve appetite (4.6%). Thirty percent of CAM users had discussed the issue with their doctors; only 7.7% had done so with their nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM, including camel products, is highly prevalent among cancer patients in the Middle East, but these patients do not necessarily divulge their CAM use to their treating physicians and nurses. Although CAM use can be beneficial, some can be very harmful, especially for cancer patients. Association is known between camel products and brucellosis and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both can lead to tremendous morbidity in immune-compromised patients. Doctor\u2013patient communication regarding CAM use is of paramount importance in cancer care.

On the other hand, influenza B was the predominant virus in the second peak period of influenza activity during the second half of March 2012. The objectives of this study were to compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or influenza B. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 2,129 adult patients with influenza-like illnesses who visited the emergency rooms of seven university hospitals in Korea from October 2011 to May 2012. Of 850 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 656 (77.2%) had influenza A (H3N2), and 194 (22.8%) influenza B. Age, and the frequencies of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hypertension were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P\u003C0.05). The frequencies of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in patients with influenza B at initial presentation were statistically higher than those in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P\u003C0.05). The rate of hospitalization, and length of hospital stay were statistically higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P\u003C0.05), and of the 79 hospitalized patients, the frequency of diabetes, hypertension, cases having at least one of the comorbid conditions, and the proportion of elderly were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P\u003C0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of males to females and elderly population were significantly higher for influenza A (H3N2) patients group compared with influenza B group. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and neuromuscular diseases were independently associated with hospitalization due to influenza.

Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing.","publish_time":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossell\u00F3, Jaume; Becken, Susanne; Santana-Gallego, Maria","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e33cda0ef0ca63f73baed53530486d229f6fc152.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517720300066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517720300066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Natural disasters","tourism sector","unexpected events","model of international tourism","effect of different types of disasters","man-made disaster events","international arrivals","reduced tourist arrivals","tourist destination choices","occurrence of different types of event change tourist","destination managers","determining factors","extent of impacts","positive effect","wide range of factors","prime examples","critical decisions","dataset","recovery","forces","exogenous ones","direct link","nature","profound effects","society","reconstruction","evidence","national level","theoretical arguments","individuals","marketing","paper","result","degrees","relationship","empirical research","gap","Findings","cases","potential"],"language":"en"},

Interactions between co-infecting parasites include resource competition, direct competition and immune-mediated interactions and each are likely to alter the dynamics of single parasites. We posit that co-infection is a driver of variation in parasite establishment and growth, ultimately altering the production of parasite transmission stages. To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux(\u002B) or co-infected with both parasites. To follow co-infection simultaneously, self-bioluminescent bacteria were used to quantify infection in vivo and in real-time, while helminth egg production was monitored in real-time using faecal samples. Co-infection resulted in high bacterial loads early in the infection (within the first 5 days) that could cause host mortality. Co-infection also produced helminth \u2018super-shedders\u2019; individuals that chronically shed the helminth eggs in larger than average numbers. Our study shows that co-infection may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the often-observed high variance in parasite load and shedding rates, and should thus be taken into consideration for disease management and control. Further, using self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters allowed quantification of the progression of infection within the whole animal of the same individuals at a fine temporal scale (daily) and significantly reduced the number of animals used (by 85%) compared with experiments that do not use in vivo techniques. Thus, we present bioluminescent imaging as a novel, non-invasive tool offering great potential to be taken forward into other applications of infectious disease ecology.","publish_time":"2013-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lass, Sandra; Hudson, Peter J.; Thakar, Juilee; Saric, Jasmina; Harvill, Eric; Albert, R\u00E9ka; Perkins, Sarah E.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e005630bf0183fb7a78efa065c0c545922d27009.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3565725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Co-infection","progression of infection","co-infecting parasites","individuals","helminth eggs","multiple parasites","helminth egg production","self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters","high bacterial loads","parasite load","parasite establishment","bioluminescent imaging","dynamics of single parasites","gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus","production of parasite transmission stages","direct competition","resource competition","high variance","disease management","respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux","immune-mediated interactions","applications of infectious disease ecology","novel","quantification","non-invasive tool","driver of variation","different treatment groups of laboratory mice","shedding rates","super-shedders\u2019","great potential","average numbers","growth","hypothesis","consideration","control","fine temporal scale","days","faecal samples","host mortality","underlying mechanisms","study","number of animals","experiments","techniques"],"language":"en"},

CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that both THERAFLEX UV\u2010Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB\u2010Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce the infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV, CCHFV and NiV in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eickmann, Markus; Gravemann, Ute; Handke, Wiebke; Tolksdorf, Frank; Reichenberg, Stefan; M\u00FCller, Thomas H.; Seltsam, Axel","journal":"Vox Sang","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef48b8004f3b7732acc9c56b4d1ccb45760a1445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31930543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["THERAFLEX","UVC","NiV","LOD","THERAFLEX MB\u2010Plasma"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["THERAFLEX MB","log","CoV","CCHFV","NiV","THERAFLEX UV","light dose","infectivity of SARS","Platelets","increasing doses of UVC light","UVC dose","treatment","platelet concentrates","increasing doses of visible light","Plasma pathogen inactivation systems","illumination dose","LOD","residual infectivity","study","Emerging viruses","Nipah virus","Congo haemorrhagic fever virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Crimean","methylene blue","Blood products","BACKGROUND","fourths","limit of detection","ability","potential threat","transfusion safety","MATERIALS","METHODS","half","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","Samples"],"language":"en"},

A range of tissue samples were collected from dogs at a re-homing centre with a history of endemic respiratory disease. The samples were tested using a conventional nested PCR assay and CRCoV was quantitated by real-time PCR. CRCoV was detected most frequently in the nasal mucosa, nasal tonsil and trachea. It was also detected in the lung, and bronchial lymph node. Of the enteric tissues, only one mesenteric lymph node sample was positive. In addition two colon samples were positive for CRCoV by nested PCR only. In conclusion, CRCoV appears to infect the upper respiratory tract preferentially.

While ECoV is likely to be pathogenic to horses, it has not been shown that experimental inoculation of horses with ECoV produces clinical signs of disease. In this study, we inoculated three Japanese draft horses with an ECoV-positive diarrheic fecal sample to confirm infection after inoculation and to investigate the clinical course and virus shedding patterns of ECoV. Virus neutralization tests showed that all three horses became infected with ECoV. Two of the three horses developed clinical signs similar to those observed during ECoV outbreaks, including fever, anorexia, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. All horses excreted a large amount of virus into their feces for more than 9 days after inoculation regardless of the presence or absence of clinical signs, which suggests that feces are an important source of ECoV infection. ECoV was also detected in nasal swabs from all horses, suggesting that respiratory transmission of ECoV may occur. Both symptomatic horses developed viremia, while the asymptomatic horse did not. White blood cell counts and serum amyloid A concentrations changed relative to the clinical condition of the inoculated horses; these may be useful markers for monitoring the clinical status of horses infected with ECoV. This is the first report of induction of clinical signs of ECoV infection in horses by experimental inoculation. These clinical and virological findings should aid further investigation of the pathogenesis of ECoV.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemoto, Manabu; Oue, Yasuhiro; Morita, Yoshinori; Kanno, Toru; Kinoshita, Yuta; Niwa, Hidekazu; Ueno, Takanori; Katayama, Yoshinari; Bannai, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Yamanaka, Takashi; Kondo, Takashi","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9c9f1cdd1cb6be4d05ad41038da1ad67cdc2b67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087042.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2205-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Japan"],"keyphrases":["ECoV outbreaks","clinical signs of ECoV infection","patterns of ECoV","pathogenesis of ECoV","clinical status of horses","inoculated horses","symptomatic horses","experimental inoculation of horses","respiratory transmission of ECoV","clinical condition","clinical course","important source of ECoV infection","clinical signs similar","absence of clinical signs","clinical signs of disease","Japanese draft horses","ECoV-positive diarrheic fecal sample","feces","Virus neutralization tests","serum amyloid","concentrations","fever","anorexia","presence","White blood cell","useful markers","viremia","investigation","report of induction","gastrointestinal dysfunction","virological findings","days","equine coronavirus","nasal swabs","asymptomatic horse","United States","study"],"language":"en"},

Re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus H5N1 poses extra challenge to IV control. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated RNA interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect. Here, we designed several amiRNAs targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1, a major determinant of pathogenicity. Expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amiRNA with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68). One amiRNA, HA-1405, significantly limited H5N1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication. AdC68-conjugated HA-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of H5N1 plaque formation in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells. Moreover, prophylactic administration with rAd(HA-1405) markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3- to 40-folds of lung viral RNA copies against four clades of H5N1 in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Our results further showed that rAd(HA-1405) conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 challenge, respectively. In conclusion, these data provided information that HA-targeting amiRNA delivered by AdC68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention.","publish_time":"2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Xinying; Zhang, Hongbo; Song, Yufeng; Zhou, Dongming; Wang, Jieru","journal":"Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c84df8edaeb086178a5dd8e6617367eedaebe283.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bbf70aeba7b4a4b8d96db253e673881ac220e36c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5014526.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253117300392; https://doi.org/10.1038/mtna.2016.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27093169/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253117300392","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institute of Cancer Research"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1 challenge","avian influenza virus H5N1","limited H5N1 replication","AdC68-conjugated HA","hemagglutinin gene of H5N1","functional amiRNA","different clades of H5N1 plaque formation","lethal clade","evolving virus","pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention","extra challenge","mediated RNA interference","folds of lung viral RNA copies","Madin","treatment","powerful antiviral approach","high specificity","Darby canine kidney cells","Institute of Cancer Research","Re-emergence of human infection","potential agent","chimpanzee adenovirus serotype","humans","major determinant of pathogenicity","information","delivery efficiency","immediate protection","Artificial microRNA","substantial morbidity","rapid effect","mice","data","amiRNAs","prophylactic administration","control","alleviated clinical symptoms","mortality","Expression","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.","publish_time":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warnes, Sarah L.; Little, Zo\u00EB R.; Keevil, C.

Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist\u2019s centre care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so. The optometrist\u2019s exclusion from differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary eye care teams remains the main hurdle to overcome and insure universal eye care in Portugal. National Health Service highlights the consequences of an overcome model.

This study was conducted to elucidate the burden of community-onset pneumonia (COP) and its etiologic fractions in Japan, the world\u2019s most aged society. METHODS: A multicenter prospective surveillance for COP was conducted from September 2011 to January 2013 in Japan. All pneumonia patients aged \u226515 years, including those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), were enrolled at four community hospitals on four major islands. The COP burden was estimated based on the surveillance data and national statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1,772 COP episodes out of 932,080 hospital visits were enrolled during the surveillance. The estimated overall incidence rates of adult COP, hospitalization, and in-hospital death were 16.9 (95% confidence interval, 13.6 to 20.9), 5.3 (4.5 to 6.2), and 0.7 (0.6 to 0.8) per 1,000 person-years (PY), respectively. The incidence rates sharply increased with age; the incidence in people aged \u226585 years was 10-fold higher than that in people aged 15-64 years. The estimated annual number of adult COP cases in the entire Japanese population was 1,880,000, and 69.4% were aged \u226565 years. Aspiration-associated pneumonia (630,000) was the leading etiologic category, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated pneumonia (530,000), Haemophilus influenzae-associated pneumonia (420,000), and respiratory virus-associated pneumonia (420,000), including influenza-associated pneumonia (30,000). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial portion of the COP burden occurs among elderly members of the Japanese adult population. In addition to the introduction of effective vaccines for S. pneumoniae and influenza, multidimensional approaches are needed to reduce the pneumonia burden in an aging society.","publish_time":"2015-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morimoto, Konosuke; Suzuki, Motoi; Ishifuji, Tomoko; Yaegashi, Makito; Asoh, Norichika; Hamashige, Naohisa; Abe, Masahiko; Aoshima, Masahiro; Ariyoshi, Koya","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c67580a2c552483f02b5df1f297d110b4263c5c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4378946.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia burden","influenza-associated pneumonia","COP burden","onset pneumonia","pneumonia patients","Aspiration-associated pneumonia","increasing burden of pneumonia","health care-associated pneumonia","Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated pneumonia","Haemophilus influenzae-associated pneumonia","respiratory virus-associated pneumonia","COP episodes","burden of community","aged society","estimated overall incidence rates of adult COP","person-years","estimated annual number of adult COP cases","Japanese adult population","entire Japanese population","surveillance data","community hospitals","aging society","people","era of global population aging","multicenter prospective surveillance","etiologic fractions","hospital visits","hospital death","emerging health issue","leading etiologic category","adults","hospitalization","elderly members","world\u2019s","introduction of effective vaccines","substantial portion","HCAP","multidimensional approaches","addition","national statistics","major islands","METHODS","total","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","PY","RESULTS","confidence interval","study"],"language":"en"},

However, our recent cellular studies reveal that removing the Ubl2 domain from MERS PLpro has no effect on its ability to process the viral polyprotein or act as an interferon antagonist, which involves deubiquitinating and deISGylating cellular proteins. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 \u00C5 and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes. We conclude that the catalytic core of MERS PLpro, i.e. without the Ubl2 domain, is sufficient for catalysis and stability in vitro with utility to evaluate potential inhibitors as a platform for structure-based drug design.","publish_time":"2017-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clasman, Jozlyn R.; B\u00E1ez-Santos, Yahira M.; Mettelman, Robert C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05aeae1608e74b17f7c92bc7661e98742e0b3fb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5228125.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep40292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ubl2 catalysis","Ubl2 enzyme","N-terminal Ubl2 domain","X-ray structure of MERS PLpro","catalytic function of MERS PLpro","catalytic core of MERS PLpro","intact structure","catalytic efficiency","thermal stability","substrate specificity","structure-based drug design","protease regulation","viral polyprotein","N-terminus","viral infection","substrate-binding loop","deISGylating cellular proteins","recent cellular studies","platform","purported inhibitor","differences","different substrates","interferon antagonist","potential inhibitors","critical role","utility","papain","effect","coronavirus polyproteins","inhibition","changes","enzymes","structures","Ubiquitin","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

An urgent worldwide threat is posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. The reasons for emerging infectious diseases are numerous and complex. Among the most significant explanations for these emerging diseases are changes in environment and ecology caused by natural phenomena such as droughts, hurricanes, and floods; and human-made phenomena such as agricultural development, urbanization, and denuding of forests. Worldwide conflict, including wars, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, have led to displacement of large populations into overcrowded settlements where safe water is not available and sanitation is poor. For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. Increased precipitation, a result of climate change, leads to more agricultural run-off, allowing pathogens to enter drinking water systems. In developing countries where poverty and inadequate infrastructure are the norm, public health monitoring systems must be supported and improved so that new or more severe risks to health can be identified and curtailed. As new infectious diseases are recognized, critical issues arise regarding pregnant women and their unborn children. Physiologic changes during pregnancy and gestational age both alter decision-making regarding vaccinations and medications.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewin, Sharon","journal":"Principles of Gender-Specific Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49d58cfebcb62abd1286784f0bc3142ac91e4026.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150108.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742711000459; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742711000459","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging infectious diseases","emerging diseases","new infectious diseases","novel infectious diseases","Worldwide conflict","drinking water systems","inadequate infrastructure","inadequate surveillance","safe water","natural phenomena","public health monitoring systems","agricultural run-off","Regional conflict","agricultural development","Physiologic changes","displacement of large populations","urgent worldwide threat","infection control","norm","overcrowded settlements","gender differences","gestational age","breakdown","huge increase","impeded access","critical issues","decision-making","pregnant women","post-war Kosovo","rat population","hurricanes","pregnancy","poverty","chapter","wars","pathogens","movement of refugees","environment","introduction","result of climate change","tularemia outbreak","ethnic cleansing","confirmed cases","unsanitary conditions","vaccinations","genocide","floods","sanitation","droughts","developing countries","urbanization","human","ecology","reasons"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, p7 is a possible target for antivirals. The consensus model for the channel formed by p7 protein is a hexameric or heptameric oligomer of \u03B1-helical hairpin monomers, each having two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2, where the N-terminal TM1 would face the lumen of this channel. A reported high-throughput functional assay to search for p7 channel inhibitors is based on carboxyfluorescein (CF) release from liposomes after p7 addition. However, the rationale for the dual ability of p7 to serve as an ion or proton channel in the infected cell, and to permeabilize membranes to large molecules like CF is not clear. We have recreated both activities in vitro, examining the conformation present in these assays using infrared spectroscopy. Our results indicate that an \u03B1-helical form of p7, which can transport protons, is not able to elicit CF release. In contrast, membrane permeabilization to CF is observed when p7 contains a high percentage of \u03B2-structure, or when using a C-terminal fragment of p7, encompassing TM2. We propose that the reported inhibitory effect of some small compounds, e.g., rimantadine, on both CF release and proton transport can be explained via binding to the membrane-inserted C-terminal half of p7, increasing its rigidity, in a similar way to the influenza A M2-rimantadine interaction.","publish_time":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gan, Siok Wan; Surya, Wahyu; Vararattanavech, Ardcharaporn; Torres, Jaume","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e8f40e1096456d1b5b0c24b57104bf15f45d37e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3883635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409277/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078494","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p7 protein","p7 addition","p7 channel inhibitors","C-terminal fragment of p7","dual ability of p7","CF release","\u03B1-helical form of p7","proton channel","membrane-inserted C-terminal half of p7","proton transport","N-terminal TM1","TM2","protein trafficking","hepatitis C virus","membrane permeabilization","reported high-throughput functional assay","heptameric oligomer of \u03B1","helical hairpin monomers","reported inhibitory effect","high percentage of \u03B2","M2-rimantadine interaction","carboxyfluorescein","amino acid long polypeptide","influenza","HCV","small compounds","membranes","hexameric","binding","liposomes","conformation present","transmembrane domains","infected cell","assays","similar way","replication","large molecules","structure","rigidity","infrared spectroscopy","rationale","possible target","antivirals","contrast","lumen","consensus model","activities","results","protons"],"language":"en"},

Background Data regarding both rates of acute respiratory illness in health care workers and experience with long\u2010term antiviral prophylaxis are sparse. Objective To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oseltamivir prophylaxis versus seasonal influenza vaccine for the prevention of influenza among health care workers. Methods We conducted a pilot, randomized control study during the 2007/2008 influenza season in a tertiary care setting. Adult health care workers 18\u201369 years of age were recruited and randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive either oseltamivir (Tamiflu(\u00AE); Roche) 75 mg once daily prophylaxis or seasonal influenza (Fluviral(\u00AE)) vaccine. Results Of 56 adults enrolled, 12 received vaccine and 44 received prophylaxis. Incidence of symptomatic laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza was similar for participants in the vaccine and prophylaxis arms (17% and 24%, respectively; P = 0\u00B771). Participants who developed an acute respiratory illness during the study period reported working 85% of scheduled work days, and 29% stated that they worked despite feeling miserable because they were too busy to stay home. Of 42 participants who initiated oseltamivir prophylaxis, four discontinued it owing to side effects. Median duration of oseltamivir prophylaxis was 121 days, with 34 (81%) continuing \u226512 weeks. Conclusions During an extended season of suboptimal vaccine match, 22% of health care workers receiving antiviral prophylaxis or seasonal influenza vaccine developed symptomatic laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza. Long\u2010term antiviral prophylaxis against influenza was generally well tolerated with good compliance.","publish_time":"2011-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coleman, Brenda L.; Boggild, Andrea K.; Drews, Steven J.; Li, Yan; Low, Donald E.; McGeer, Allison J.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54a31f217ac499b477dd23edb24e41e736d906c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780657.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00245.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668681/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza season","seasonal influenza vaccine","prevention of influenza","pilot study of influenza vaccine","daily prophylaxis","prophylaxis arms","tolerability of oseltamivir prophylaxis","long\u2010term antiviral prophylaxis","Canadian health care workers","Adult health care workers","Median duration of oseltamivir prophylaxis","participants","tertiary care setting","extended season of suboptimal vaccine match","Respiratory illnesses","Respiratory Viruses","rates of acute respiratory illness","study period","randomized control study","Incidence of symptomatic laboratory","scheduled work days","experience","Fluviral","efficacy","Background Data","Conclusions","Coleman","Tamiflu","Roche","years of age","Objective","Methods","adults","good compliance","Results","paper","effects","weeks"],"language":"en"},

HealthMap is part of a new generation of online systems designed to monitor and visualize, on a real-time basis, disease outbreak alerts as reported by online news media and public health sources. HealthMap is of specific interest for national and international public health organizations and international travelers. A particular task that makes such a surveillance useful is the automated discovery of the geographic references contained in the retrieved outbreak alerts. This task is sometimes referred to as \u0022geo-parsing\u0022. A typical approach to geo-parsing would demand an expensive training corpus of alerts manually tagged by a human. RESULTS: Given that human readers perform this kind of task by using both their lexical and contextual knowledge, we developed an approach which relies on a relatively small expert-built gazetteer, thus limiting the need of human input, but focuses on learning the context in which geographic references appear. We show in a set of experiments, that this approach exhibits a substantial capacity to discover geographic locations outside of its initial lexicon. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis provide a framework for future automated global surveillance efforts that reduce manual input and improve timeliness of reporting.","publish_time":"2009-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keller, Mikaela; Freifeld, Clark C; Brownstein, John S","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57694e4ef5e2af0338dc7ba54cf154b2b0cdda76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2787530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19930702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Automated surveillance","geographic references","disease outbreak alerts","future automated global surveillance efforts","surveillance useful","automated discovery","retrieved outbreak alerts","geographic locations","typical approach","geo-parsing","need of human input","human readers","RESULTS","kind of task","particular task","HealthMap","international public health organizations","public health sources","international travelers","manual input","expensive training corpus of alerts","global emerging infectious disease threats","online news media","new generation of online systems","alerting","framework","sensitive method","Internet","analysis","substantial capacity","real-time basis","gazetteer","timeliness of reporting","contextual knowledge","initial lexicon","BACKGROUND","small expert","CONCLUSION","set of experiments"],"language":"en"},

As a result, animals rescued from hoarding frequently have a variety of medical conditions including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disease, parasitism, malnutrition, and other evidence of neglect. The purpose of this study was to characterize the infectious diseases carried by clinically affected cats and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among cats in large-scale cat hoarding investigations. Records were reviewed retrospectively from four large-scale seizures of cats from failed sanctuaries from November 2009 through March 2012. The number of cats seized in each case ranged from 387 to 697. Cats were screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in all four cases and for dermatophytosis in one case. A subset of cats exhibiting signs of upper respiratory disease or diarrhea had been tested for infections by PCR and fecal flotation for treatment planning. Mycoplasma felis (78%), calicivirus (78%), and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (55%) were the most common respiratory infections. Feline enteric coronavirus (88%), Giardia (56%), Clostridium perfringens (49%), and Tritrichomonas foetus (39%) were most common in cats with diarrhea. The seroprevalence of FeLV and FIV were 8% and 8%, respectively. In the one case in which cats with lesions suspicious for dermatophytosis were cultured for Microsporum canis, 69/76 lesional cats were culture-positive; of these, half were believed to be truly infected and half were believed to be fomite carriers. Cats from large-scale hoarding cases had high risk for enteric and respiratory infections, retroviruses, and dermatophytosis. Case responders should be prepared for mass treatment of infectious diseases and should implement protocols to prevent transmission of feline or zoonotic infections during the emergency response and when transferring the rescued cats to other shelters or to adopters.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Polak, K.

In this study, an oral recombinant Lactobacillus casei vaccine against PEDV infection targeting the intestinal microfold (M) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) for delivering the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV spike protein was developed with M cell-targeting peptide (Col) and dendritic cell-targeting peptide (DCpep). The immunogenicity of the orally administered recombinant strains was evaluated. RESULTS: After immunization, significantly higher levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibodies with PEDV neutralizing activity in the sera and mucosal sIgA antibodies in the tractus genitalis, intestinal mucus, and stools were detected in mice orally administered with the recombinant strain pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393, which expressed DCpep and Col targeting ligands fused with the PEDV COE antigen, compared to mice orally immunized with the recombinant strain pPG-COE/L393 without the DCpep and Col targeting ligands. Moreover, in response to restimulation with the PEDV COE antigen in vitro, a significant difference in splenocyte proliferation response and Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 level was observed in the group of mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393 (p \u003C 0.05) compared to the groups of mice that received pPG-COE-Col/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal M cells- and DCs-targeting oral delivery of genetically engineered Lactobacillus expressing the COE antigen of PEDV can efficiently induce anti-PEDV mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses via oral administration, suggesting a promising vaccine strategy against PEDV infection.

The results indicate that the urban labor market experienced a direct effect in terms of a reduction in employment of the group vulnerable to the epidemic while the rural labor market experienced an indirect effect on its economy through a reduction in employment resulting from a decline in consumption and leisure activities. If one looks into the employment in the accommodation and leisure industry, which sustained the most severe blow, dropped to its lowest level right after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The rural leisure and accommodation industries are highly likely to be dependent on consumption and spending from urban areas. The results suggest that the rural labor market was influenced by the spillover/external effects caused by behavioral changes among people in urban areas due to fear of infection. Thus, this empirical analysis can be used to customize policy to support regions that can be negatively impacted by spillovers due to epidemic in order to respond against economic stresses.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ayoung; Cho, Joonmo","journal":"Japan and the World Economy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/351904bbe9db055b91bb2712b06ff2fe5224e46e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126267.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0922142517300178; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142517300178; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2017.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["urban areas","rural areas","employment","rural leisure","urban labor market","rural labor market","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic","reduction","consumption","large number of people","small number of people","leisure industry","leisure activities","results","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak","behavioral changes","indirect effect","accommodation industries","difference approach","lowest level right","decline","terms","Korea","external effects","group vulnerable","order","economy","spending","fear of infection","severe blow","economic stresses","policy","spillovers","study","empirical analysis","regions"],"language":"en"},

These Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions provide a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune systems by combining the potent antiviral activity of innate effector cells with the diversity and specificity of the adaptive humoral response. The Fc receptor-dependent function of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) provides mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells, as well as for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by facilitating antigen presentation, or by stimulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. In this review, we discuss the properties of Fc receptors, antibodies, and effector cells that influence ADCP. We also provide and interpret evidence from studies that support a potential role for ADCP in either inhibiting or enhancing viral infection. Finally, we describe current approaches used to measure antiviral ADCP and discuss considerations for the translation of studies performed in animal models. We propose that additional investigation into the role of ADCP in protective viral responses, the specific virus epitopes targeted by ADCP antibodies, and the types of phagocytes and Fc receptors involved in ADCP at sites of virus infection will provide insight into strategies to successfully leverage this important immune response for improved antiviral immunity through rational vaccine design.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tay, Matthew Zirui; Wiehe, Kevin; Pollara, Justin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bcf7c070cff74e01013527a1957c676487d98d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6404786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873178/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral ADCP","ADCP antibodies","role of ADCP","immune effector cells","Fc receptor-dependent function of antibody","Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions","antigen immune complexes","adaptive immune systems","virus-infected cells","important immune response","properties of Fc receptors","Antiviral activities of antibodies","potent antiviral activity of innate effector cells","clearance of virus","stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses","sites of virus infection","improved antiviral immunity","specific virus epitopes","dependent cellular phagocytosis","antigen presentation","cognate antigen","adaptive humoral response","interactions","viral infection","protective viral responses","potential role","translation of studies","immunoproteins","direct link","specificity","diversity","mechanisms","rational vaccine design","binding","strategies","types of phagocytes","neutralization","insight","considerations","infectious virion","animal models","additional investigation","current approaches","secretion of inflammatory mediators","evidence","review"],"language":"en"},

Luciferase assay results showed the putative regulatory region was a functional element, in which rs383510 regulated TMPRSS2 expression in a genotype-specific manner. Notably, rs2070788 and rs383510 were significantly associated with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) influenza in 102 patients with A(H7N9) influenza and 106 healthy controls. Therefore, we demonstrate that genetic variants with higher TMPRSS2 expression confer higher risk to severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza. The same variants also increase susceptibility to human A(H7N9) influenza.","publish_time":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Zhongshan; Zhou, Jie; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chu, Hin; Li, Cun; Wang, Dong; Yang, Dong; Zheng, Shufa; Hao, Ke; Boss\u00E9, Yohan; Obeidat, Ma\u0027en; Brandsma, Corry-Anke; Song, You-Qiang; Chen, Yu; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Li, Lanjuan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a51b5561a16889a18c75e7ce907be745c173ffea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25904605/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv246","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pdm09 influenza","H1N1","higher TMPRSS2 expression","higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2","severe infection","rs383510","H7N9","higher risk","genetic variants","putative regulatory region","risk variant","patients","GG genotype of rs2070788","susceptibility","candidate variants","functional element","mild infection","lung expression quantitative trait locus data set","healthy controls","genetic predisposition","genotype-specific manner","functional single-nucleotide polymorphism","pilot genome-wide association study","Luciferase assay results","cases","odds ratio","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We designed an online, semi-structured stakeholder questionnaire to collect information on global outbreak surveillance sources and limitations from participants who use epidemic intelligence and outbreak alert services in their work in government and nongovernment organizations in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. RESULTS: All respondents agreed that it was important to remain up to date with global outbreaks. The main reason cited for following global outbreak news was as an early warning for serious epidemics. Mainstream media and specialist Internet sources such as the World Health Organization (n = 54/91; 59%), the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED)-mail (n = 45/91; 49%) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n = 31/91; 34%) were the most common sources for global outbreak news; rapid intelligence services such as HealthMap were less common (n = 9/91; 10%). Only 51% (n = 46/91) of respondents thought that their sources of outbreak news were timely and sufficient for their needs. CONCLUSION: For those who work in epidemic response, epidemic intelligence is important and widely used. Stakeholders are less aware of and less frequently use rapid sources such as HealthMap and rely more on validated but less timely traditional sources of disease surveillance. Users identified a need for more timely and reliable epidemic intelligence.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hii, Aurysia; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Housen, Tambri; Saketa, Salanieta; Kunasekaran, Mohana Priya; Sulaiman, Feroza; Yanti, NK Semara; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina","journal":"Western Pac Surveill Response J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4facb7cbe620956211550e1a035b0281f2db5cfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6356040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30766745/; https://doi.org/10.5365/wpsar.2018.9.2.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sources of outbreak news","global outbreak surveillance sources","global outbreak news","rapid sources","epidemic response","common sources","reliable epidemic intelligence","epidemic observatory","outbreak alert services","timely traditional sources of disease surveillance","global outbreaks","rapid intelligence services","specialist Internet sources","Asia","Pacific region","HealthMap","stakeholders","work","respondents","needs","Disease Control","information","areas","limitations","participants","development","semi-structured stakeholder questionnaire","nongovernment organizations","selected countries","early warning","ProMED","Prevention","World Health Organization","United States Centers","Emerging Diseases","mail","Mainstream media","Epi-watch","main reason","Program","serious epidemics","date","Users","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

But the changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence based on the longitudinal observation data were rarely studied. METHODS: The reporting incidence (RI) and mortality data on HIV and AIDS in China covering 31 provinces from 2004 to 2014 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center. To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups. RESULTS: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes for HIV infection and AIDS incidence were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10\u20131.13) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23\u20131.33), respectively. The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11\u20131.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06\u20131.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26\u20131.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17\u20131.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] \u003E 1.30) was detected in people aged 55 years or above. CONCLUSIONS: HIV and AIDS showed an increasing trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new \u201Chop-spots\u201D for HIV and AIDS risk.","publish_time":"2018-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhenqiu; Shi, Oumin; Yan, Qiong; Fang, Qiwen; Zuo, Jialu; Chen, Yue; Chen, Xingdong; Zhang, Tiejun","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9a7674c9052c8a2db502ec640a9e9cd1d6cef34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6307199.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3551-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Empirical Mode Decomposition","AIDS RI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["AIDS incidence","AIDS epidemic","HIV infections","AIDS risk","high HIV","trends of HIV","number of AIDS cases","relative change of incidence","changing patterns of HIV","relative increases","largest relative increase","overall relative changes","lowest relative increase","reporting incidence","northwest provinces","Northwest China","mortality data","young people","time-series data","longitudinal observation data","older people","females","Chinese Public Health Science Data Center","young adults","person years","Henan","Empirical Mode Decomposition","Xinjiang","hop-spots","substantial progress","Guangxi","EMD","odds ratio","control","increasing trend","age groups","Yunnan","BACKGROUND","total","METHODS","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","mathematical model","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ceribelli, Angela; Motta, Francesca; De Santis, Maria; Ansari, Aftab A.; Ridgway, William M.; Gershwin, M.

At a time when elective surgeries are being suspended and questions are being raised about how the remaining procedures on COVID-19 positive patients can be performed safely, it is important to consider the potential role of robotic assisted surgery within the current pandemic. Recently, several robotic assisted surgery societies have issued their recommendations. To date, however, no specific recommendations are available for cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. Here, we discuss the potential risks, benefits, and preventive measures that need to be taken into account when considering robotic assisted surgery for cardiothoracic indications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. It is suggested that robotic assisted surgery might have various advantages such as early recovery after surgery, shorter hospital stay, and reduced loss of blood and fluids as well as smaller incisions. However, electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices, as well as CO2 insufflation should be managed with caution to prevent the risk of aerosolization of viral particles.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van den Eynde, Jef; De Groote, Senne; Van Lerberghe, Robin; Van den Eynde, Raf; Oosterlinck, Wouter","journal":"J Robot Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ad307aa29d86f3fa0f75ba334626fbd5b3e9e6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207081.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385799/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-020-01090-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery","robotic assisted surgery societies","potential role of robotic assisted surgery","confirmed COVID","positive patients","cardiothoracic indications","specific recommendations","potential risks","current pandemic","various advantages","shorter hospital","early recovery","fluids","reduced loss of blood","risk of aerosolization","caution","benefits","immense threat","ultrasonic devices","CO2 insufflation","preventive measures","healthcare systems","remaining procedures","elective surgeries","viral particles","account","smaller incisions","time","questions","date","coronavirus disease"],"language":"en"},

Canine distemper (CDV) was suspected to be responsible for the decline of the Santa Catalina Island fox, so knowledge of infectious disease exposure in the remaining island fox populations was urgently needed. This study reviewed previous pathogen exposure in island foxes and investigated the current threat by conducting a serologic survey of foxes on all islands and sympatric feral cats on three islands from 2001 to 2003 for antibodies against canid pathogens. Before the decline, foxes had evidence of exposure to CDV, canine adenovirus (CAV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and Toxoplasma, with exposure to these five pathogens differing greatly by island. Exposure to canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), and Leptospira was rare. In 2001\u20132003, wild-born foxes had evidence of exposure to CDV (5.2\u201332.8%) on 5 of 6 islands, CPV (28\u2013100%) and CAV (4.7\u2013100%) on five islands, and Toxoplasma gondii (2.3\u201315.4%) on four islands. Exposure to CCV, CHV and Leptospira was less common. Sharing of infectious agents between sympatric foxes and feral cats appeared minimal, but CDV exposure was detected in two cats on Santa Catalina Island. Domestic dogs have historically been present on the islands, but it is not known if canine diseases can be maintained in fox populations without the continual presence of dogs. Targeted vaccination programs against the most virulent pathogens and continued intensive disease surveillance may help protect the critically small remaining fox populations from disease outbreaks that could threaten the success of ongoing conservation efforts.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clifford, Deana L.; Mazet, Jonna A.K.; Dubovi, Edward J.; Garcelon, David K.; Coonan, Timothy J.; Conrad, Patricia A.; Munson, Linda","journal":"Biological Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/145b849ffc443529651d531b40b392078823f4ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226080/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706001625; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320706001625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leptospira"],"organizations":["CPV","CAV"],"locations":["Santa Catalina Island"],"keyphrases":["CDV exposure","island foxes","evidence of exposure","remaining island fox populations","Abstract Island fox","Santa Catalina Island fox","sympatric foxes","knowledge of infectious disease exposure","canine adenovirus","canine parvovirus","canine herpesvirus","canine coronavirus","canine diseases","Canine distemper","previous pathogen exposure","small remaining fox populations","California Channel Islands","sympatric feral cats","serologic survey of foxes","disease outbreaks","CHV","CCV","virulent pathogens","decline","Leptospira","canid pathogens","CAV","CPV","intensive disease surveillance","infectious agents","Toxoplasma gondii","Domestic dogs","continual presence of dogs","Urocyon littoralis","current threat","study","Targeted vaccination programs","success of ongoing conservation efforts","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Binding of N protein to membranes of mouse fibroblast L-2 cells is very specific and occurs under conditions in which no other viral or cellular proteins show datectable binding. Binding occurs with both free and nucleocapsid-associated N protein, arguing for membrane-binding sites on the N protein itself, rather than on RNA. Binding of N protein also occurs to membranes in the absence of MHV matrix (M) protein which is known to interact with the N protein. Both non-viral, single-stranded RNA and DNA inhibit membrane binding of N protein. In addition, purified phospholipid liposomes compete against N protein binding to membranes. Of various phospholipids tested, cardiolipin was the most effective in inhibiting membrane binding. The N protein was also shown to bind directly to phospholipid liposomes containing cardiolipin as well as to liposomes containing total lipids extracted from mouse L-2 cells. Because of certain structural similarities between phospholipids and nucleic acids, we speculate that membrane lipid association of the N protein may compete for RNA binding sites on the N protein. Such a mechanism may be important for processes such as nucleocapsid uncoating and nucleocapsid assembly. Most interestingly the properties of phospholipid and nucleic acid binding are markedly similar to those recently described for the bacterial DNA-binding proteins DnaA and recA.","publish_time":"1993-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Robert; Wong, Fred","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283712535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283712535","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein binding","membrane binding of N protein","nucleocapsid-associated N protein","datectable binding","membrane-binding sites","inhibiting membrane binding","RNA binding sites","nucleic acid binding","bacterial DNA-binding proteins DnaA","phospholipid liposomes","nucleocapsid uncoating","nucleocapsid assembly","membrane lipid association","membranes of mouse fibroblast","properties of phospholipid","cardiolipin","certain lipids","cells","mouse hepatitis virus","single-stranded RNA","nucleic acids","cellular proteins","various phospholipids","total lipids","absence of MHV matrix","certain structural similarities","murine coronavirus","processes","recA","mechanism","conditions","addition","Abstract Evidence"],"language":"en"},

Our results suggest that BST2 exerts a broad blocking effect against enveloped virus release, regardless of whether budding occurs at the plasma membrane or intracellular compartments.","publish_time":"2014-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da4831bc0999db4090ab0a290709eddb0b2bf0d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.11.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682213006521; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682213006521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of BST2","BST2 restriction bud","BST2 knockdown expression results","E virions","enveloped viruses subject","E virion production","release of various enveloped viruses","enhanced HCoV","enveloped virus release","budding","progeny viruses","plasma membrane","intracellular membranes","intracellular compartments","production of human coronavirus","broad blocking effect","cell surfaces","Abstract Bone marrow stromal antigen","ER-Golgi intermediate compartment","ERGIC","cells","interferon-inducible antiviral factor","Electron microscopy analyses","innate immune system component","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The PDIS method is based on photodiagnostic physics and high resolution spectroscopy and is using calibrated spectroscopic data for the diagnostic analysis of the blood screening spectra. Using Confocal Laser Scanning Mikcroscopy the Indocyangreen-uptake of different cell lines of breast cancer cells is studied. RESULTS: The PDIS supplies calibrated diagnostic data about the presence or absence of CTCs and CTC clusters in the bloodstream with a sensitivity of 98 %. Therefore, the PDIS is suited to control the blood of cancer patients with respect of CTC and CTC clusters with an resolution of one CTC and one CTC cluster per blood volume. PDIS distinguishes the different phenotypes of CTC clusters. CONCLUSION: Circulating tumor cell slusters play a key role in the metastatic process and are formed only in solid tumors, they are appropriate objects to validate cancer treatments and to recognice cancer formation. The PDIS is a calibrated diagnostic method which allows to evaluate the results of solid tumor treatments and of chemotherapy treatments and to optimize the individual cancer treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schikora, Detlef","journal":"Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfcbf00580ce41765daa88a384016a408ff1d97b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/69aedd78e1e142120aa6b2f424b95ff5337895b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153531.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572100020301083; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572100020301083?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Photodiagnostic Infrared Spectroscoppy","PDIS","CTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDIS method","cancer treatments","circulating tumor clusters","respect of CTC","calibrated diagnostic method","different phenotypes of CTC clusters","tumor cells","calibrated diagnostic data","blood of cancer patients","results of solid tumor treatments","new diagnostic method","diagnostic analysis","tumor cell slusters","recognice cancer formation","different cell lines of breast cancer cells","chemotherapy treatments","calibrated spectroscopic data","individual cancer treatment strategies","blood volume","blood screening spectra","photodiagnostic physics","solid tumors","Photodiagnostic Infrared Spectroscoppy","high resolution spectroscopy","Indocyangreen-uptake","key role","presence","absence of CTCs","Confocal Laser Scanning Mikcroscopy","appropriate objects","bloodstream","metastatic process","circulatory system","CONCLUSION","sensitivity","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We surveyed all U.S. schools of public health, colleges of public health, and public health schools accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health (CEPH). We included accredited public health programs, so that all states offering public health education were represented. We analyzed survey data, public health books, and board certification guidelines. We used PubMed to identify public health curriculum papers, and assessed 2019 CEPH accreditation requirements. We merged POCT knowledge bases to design a new curriculum for teaching public health students and practitioners the principles and practice of POCT. Results: Public health curricula, certification requirements, and textbooks generally do not include POCT instruction. Only one book, Global Point of Care: Strategies for Disasters, Emergencies, and Public Health Resilience, and one online course on public health preparedness address POCT and public health intervention issues. The topic, POC HIV/HCV ED testing, appeared in one course and POC diagnostics in local clinics, in another. Papers on public health curriculum have not incorporated POCT. No curriculum addresses POCT in isolation units during quarantine, despite evidence that recent Ebola virus disease cases in the U.S. and elsewhere proved unequivocally the need for POCT. The modular learning objectives identified in this paper were customized for public health students. Public health graduates can use boot camps, online credentialing, and self-study to acquire POCT skills. Conclusions: Enhancing accreditation requirements, academic training, board certification, and field experience will generate public health healthcare professionals who will rely upon evidence-based medical decision making at points of care, including during crises when time is of the essence. A POCT-enabled public health workforce can help prevent and stop outbreaks. Public health-based medical professionals urgently need the skills necessary to perform POCT and prepare America and other nations for threats portending significant adverse medical, economic, social, and cultural impact.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kost, Gerald J.; Zadran, A.; Zadran, L.; Ventura, I.","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87810195a429d5f1d8b494f1170c9e82bc24f9a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6361824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761282/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00385","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT","Public Health Resilience","POC HIV/HCV ED","POC"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["public health professionals","schools of public health","public health schools","public health education","public health practice","public health students","public health books","Public health curricula","colleges of public health","Public health graduates","Public Health Resilience","public health workforce","public health curriculum papers","public health healthcare professionals","accredited public health programs","public health preparedness address POCT","public health intervention issues","practice of POCT","POCT skills","teaching POCT","incorporated POCT","POCT instruction","curriculum addresses POCT","POCT knowledge bases","care testing","medical professionals","certification requirements","points of care","new curriculum","points of need","Global Point of Care","evidence-based diagnosis","CEPH accreditation requirements","online course","board certification guidelines","future standards of care","medical decision","modular learning objectives","online credentialing","POC HIV","POC diagnostics","skills necessary","HCV ED testing","quarantine","field experience","boot camps","emergency responders","threats","nations","academic training","isolation units","Emergencies","Disasters","practitioners","principles","recent Ebola virus disease cases","Council","limited-resource settings","Strategies","self-study","textbooks","states","crisis situations","topic","local clinics","crises","America","triage","survey data","Results","PubMed","awareness of benefits","cultural impact","time","Conclusions","essence","outbreaks","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO. A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine. An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, Jeffrey P.; Stammers, Alfred H.; St. Louis, James; Hayanga, J.

Several HERV genes have been detected as transcripts and proteins in the central nervous system, frequently in the context of neuroinflammation. The HERV-W family has received substantial attention in large part because of associations with diverse syndromes including multiple sclerosis (MS) and several psychiatric disorders. A HERV-W-related retroelement, multiple sclerosis retrovirus (MSRV), has been reported in MS patients to be both a biomarker as well as an effector of aberrant immune responses. HERV-H and HERV-K have also been implicated in MS and other neurological diseases but await delineation of their contributions to disease. The HERV-W envelope-encoded glycosylated protein, syncytin-1, is encoded by chromosome 7q21 and exhibits increased glial expression within MS lesions. Overexpression of syncytin-1 in glia induces endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to neuroinflammation and the induction of free radicals, which damage proximate cells.

Using biophysical, molecular biology and antiviral assays, we showed that the HSV-1 genome displays multiple clusters of repeated sequences that form very stable G-quadruplexes. These sequences are mainly located in the inverted repeats of the HSV-1 genome. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with the G-quadruplex ligand BRACO-19 induced inhibition of virus production. BRACO-19 was able to inhibit Taq polymerase processing at G-quadruplex forming sequences in the HSV-1 genome, and decreased intracellular viral DNA in infected cells.

Among antibody sources, immunoglobulin Y (IgY) is the major antibody found in chicken eggs and can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies normally used in research and immunotherapy. In this study, phage-expressing chicken monoclonal scFv antibody was chosen and characterized with phage display antibody technology. Truncated fragments of SARS-CoV spike protein were cloned in pET-21 vector and expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. After purification, the purity of these recombinant spike proteins was examined on SDS\u2013PAGE and their identity verified with Western blot analysis using anti-his antibodies and sera from convalescent stage SARS-CoV-infected patients. Using these bacteria-derived proteins to immunize chickens, it was found that polyclonal IgY antibodies in the egg yolk and sera were highly reactive to the immunogens, as shown by Western blot and immunocytochemical staining analysis. A phage displaying scFv library was also established from spleen B cells of immunized chicken with 5\u00D7107 clones. After four panning cycles, the eluted phage titer showed a 10-fold increase. In sequence analysis with chicken germline gene, five phage clones reacted, with large dissimilarities of between 31 and 62%, in the complementarity-determining regions, one dominant phage 4S1 had strong binding to fragment Se-e, located between amino acid residues 456\u2013650 of the spike protein and this particular phage had significantly strong binding to SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

CONCLUSION: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.","publish_time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elkholy, Amgad A.; Grant, Rebecca; Assiri, Abdullah; Elhakim, Mohamed; Malik, Mamunur R.; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ec1bf2fc5d286672feb316e70accdd302d7ed50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102841.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119301443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056437/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119301443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["secondary healthcare workers cases","non-healthcare workers cases","healthcare settings","healthcare facilities","MERS-CoV cases","secondary cases of MERS","healthcare-associated outbreaks","CoV infection","secondary transmission of MERS","secondary infections","death","reported laboratory","risk factors","Year of infection","independent protective factors","epidemiological data of laboratory","fewer comorbidities","infections of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high threat respiratory pathogens","continuity of care","Multivariable logistic regression","retrospective analysis","patients","higher rates of survival","World Health Organization","half","extension","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","non-nationals","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Based on the presence of deletion mutations in the FIPVs and not in the FECVs, it was concluded that FIPVs evolved as mutants of FECVs. The mutations are deletions in the FIPVs and not insertions in the FECVs since similar sequences are present in other strains that have segregated earlier from a common ancestor. Therefore, the order of descent is from FECV to FIPV. Mutations unique to FIPVs were found in open reading frames (ORFs) 3c in 4 of 6 isolates and/or 7b in 3 of 6 isolates.

It is therefore not surprising that the major steps of the life cycle of viruses of animals and plants also depend on cellular membranes. Indeed, interactions of viral proteins with host cell membranes are important for viruses to enter into host cells, replicate their genome, and produce progeny particles. To replicate its genome, a virus first needs to cross the plasma membrane. Some viruses can also modify intracellular membranes of host cells to create a compartment in which genome replication will take place. Finally, some viruses acquire an envelope, which is derived either from the plasma membrane or an internal membrane of the host cell.

Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans, great apes and non-human primates (NHPs) with high fatality rates. In contrast, Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), the only species found outside Africa, is lethal to some NHPs but has never been linked to clinical disease in humans despite documented exposure. REBOV was isolated from pigs in the Philippines and subsequent experiments confirmed the susceptibility of pigs to both REBOV and ZEBOV with predilection for the lungs. However, only ZEBOV caused severe lung pathology in 5\u20136 weeks old pigs leading to respiratory distress. To further elucidate the mechanisms for lung pathology, microarray analysis of changes in gene expression was performed on lung tissue from ZEBOV-infected pigs. Furthermore, systemic effects were monitored by looking at changes in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets and systemic cytokine responses. Following oro-nasal challenge, ZEBOV replicated mainly in the respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation of the lungs and consequently rapid and difficult breathing. Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrated the lungs but only the latter were positive for ZEBOV antigen. Genes for proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins, known to attract immune cells to sites of infection, were upregulated in the lungs, causing the heavy influx of cells into this site. Systemic effects included a decline in the proportion of monocyte/dendritic and B cells and a mild proinflammatory cytokine response. Serum IgM was detected on day 5 and 6 post infection. In conclusion, a dysregulation/over-activation of the pulmonary proinflammatory response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection in 5\u20136 weeks old pigs by attracting inflammatory cells to the lungs.","publish_time":"2013-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nfon, Charles K.; Leung, Anders; Smith, Greg; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Kobinger, Gary; Weingartl, Hana M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b3ea086b81a5e0c4dd22aa41653befc358d7163.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3633953.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23626748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Neutrophils","ZEBOV"],"locations":["Africa","Philippines"],"keyphrases":["lungs","ZEBOV-infected pigs","ZEBOV antigen","pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection","weeks old pigs","susceptibility of pigs","REBOV","severe lung pathology","B cells","immune cells","inflammatory cells","systemic effects","humans","proinflammatory cytokines","mild proinflammatory cytokine response","pulmonary proinflammatory response","lung tissue","severe inflammation","NHPs","heavy influx of cells","systemic cytokine responses","sites of infection","post infection","severe haemorrhagic fever","Ebola viruses","respiratory tract","respiratory distress","Reston ebolavirus","Zaire ebolavirus","microarray analysis of changes","filamentous single-stranded RNA viruses","great apes","non-human primates","peripheral blood leukocyte subsets","chemokines","over-activation","gene expression","crucial role","acute phase proteins","proportion of monocyte","subsequent experiments","dysregulation","clinical disease","documented exposure","high fatality rates","family Filoviridae","day","Philippines","decline","mechanisms","conclusion","Africa","species","difficult breathing","oro-nasal challenge","contrast","predilection","Serum IgM","Neutrophils","macrophages"],"language":"en"},

Routine hematological/biochemical variables in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS (2003) were compared with those in consecutive patients hospitalized June\u2013December 2004 with radiologically confirmed CAP. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to identify discriminating variables at baseline and by day 3 of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspiration and antigen detection for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were routinely performed in patients with CAP. Altogether, 181 patients with CAP (who remained undiagnosed by IFA) and 303 patients with SARS were studied. The mean intervals from symptom onset to admission were 3.1 and 2.8 days, respectively (p \u003E 0.05). The etiological agent of CAP was identified retrospectively in only 39% of cases, the majority being bacterial pathogens. At baseline, age and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were the only independent discriminating variables (p \u003C 0.0001). Using a value of \u003C4.4 \u00D7 10(9)/l as the cutoff for ANC, the sensitivity and specificity of ANC for discriminating SARS were 64 and 95%, respectively (AUC 0.90). By day 3 of hospitalization, age (p \u003C 0.0001), change in ANC (p = 0.0003), and change in bilirubin (p = 0.0065) were discriminating variables.

There are only a few laboratory features (including lymphopenia) that clearly discriminate SARS from other causes of CAP. Nevertheless, when evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with CAP and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low ANC on presentation along with poor clinical and laboratory responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion for SARS and indicate a need to perform SARS-CoV testing.","publish_time":"2006-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, N.; Rainer, T.

A survey of travelers and of residents along the Malawi-Mozambique border found that most cross it frequently and that they rarely travel empty-handed, often taking plants and animals with them. People also cross borders seeking medical attention. Attempting to limit travel would hamper an already struggling economy, where many people make a living by producing, processing or transporting plants and animals for food.

A recent assessment found that nearly one-third (32%, 1,856 species) of the world\u2019s amphibian species are threatened. Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions. Finally, I will discuss how the apparently rapid increase in the prevalence of amphibian limb deformities is linked to the synergistic effects of trematode infection and exposure to chemical contaminants.","publish_time":"2010-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiesecker, Joseph M.","journal":"Ecol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9732a47edb629782bf6eaf9424291f2d95d88556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Pacific"],"keyphrases":["susceptibility of amphibians","world\u2019s amphibian species","disease susceptibility","pathogen-mediated amphibian declines","prevalence of amphibian limb deformities","major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines","disease emergence","disease outbreaks","exposure","earth","potential effects of stressors","environmental stressors","opportunistic pathogens","wildlife populations","appearance of novel pathogens","synergistic effects of trematode infection","tropical Pacific","forefront","stage","role of stress","mass extinction event","elevated sea-surface temperatures","chemical contaminants","human","rapid increase","alarming number of extinctions","climate","series of case studies","result","regions","decades","vertebrate taxa","widespread consensus","Infectious diseases","recent assessment","years"],"language":"en"},

A broad repertoire of memory T-cells must be developed and maintained to effectively protect against viral invasions; yet, the total number of memory T-cells is constrained between infections. Thus, creating memory to new infections can require attrition of some existing memory cells. Furthermore, some viruses induce memory T-cell death early in an infection, after which surviving cells proliferate to refill the memory compartment. We develop mathematical models of cellular attrition and proliferation in order to examine how new viral infections impact existing immunity. With these probabilistic models, we qualitatively and quantitatively predict how the composition and diversity of the memory repertoire changes as a result of viral infections. In addition, we calculate how often immunity to prior diseases is lost due to new infections. Comparing our results across multiple general infection types allows us to draw conclusions about, which types of viral effects most drastically alter existing immunity. We find that early memory attrition does not permanently alter the repertoire composition, while infections that spark substantial new memory generation drastically shift the repertoire and hasten the decline of existing immunity.","publish_time":"2013-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, Courtney L.; Adler, Frederick R.","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f968580d78a252c8083a50dcb6c3ac62a7933400.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088647.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozc40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing memory cells","memory compartment","memory repertoire changes","new infections","early memory attrition","new viral infections","broad repertoire of memory T-cells","pathogen-specific memory cells","total number of memory T-cells","substantial new memory generation","memory T-cell death","result of viral infections","decline of existing immunity","repertoire composition","viral invasions","types of viral effects","mathematical models of cellular attrition","multiple general infection types","prior diseases","probabilistic models","proliferation","order","results","viruses","conclusions","disease reoccurrences","diversity","addition"],"language":"en"},

The S1 hypervariable region of Cal99 genome was most closely related to Arkansas (Ark) serotype viruses. In this study, the complete genome of Cal99 was sequenced, and the structural protein genes were compared with those of commonly used IBV vaccines as well as those of isolates from naturally occurring outbreaks in different parts of the world, to elucidate potential sources of genetic material. Based on sequence comparison, the prototype Cal99 virus is similar to the apathogenic ArkDPI virus, except in the S1 gene and stretches of sequence in the S2 and M structural protein genes, which are more related to Connecticut (Conn) and Massachusetts (Mass) strain viruses, respectively. We speculate that these two fragments came from a Conn and a Mass virus, respectively, and were incorporated into a virus largely derived from ArkDPI. Since Ark, Conn and Mass strains have been simultaneously used as live vaccines in California, both point mutations and recombination among vaccine strains may have contributed to the emergence of the Cal99 variant virus. Analysis of the structural protein genes of six Cal99 isolates demonstrated that viruses of this serotype may differ substantially in the non-S1 structural genes. Finally, we performed a challenge study with Cal99 and demonstrated that the virus causes late-onset respiratory disease, with a severity comparable to that of the M41 IBV challenge strain.","publish_time":"2007-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mondal, Shankar P.; Cardona, Carol J.","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b206a0c8b14d68cd814c5727806018480d162392.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozkz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central California"],"keyphrases":["Cal99 variant virus","prototype Cal99 virus","Mass virus","Cal99 isolates","structural protein genes","complete genome of Cal99","apathogenic ArkDPI virus","non-S1 structural genes","S1 hypervariable region of Cal99 genome","variant of infectious bronchitis virus","Mass strains","serotype viruses","strain viruses","used IBV vaccines","Central California","S1 gene","M41 IBV challenge strain","challenge study","vaccine strains","sequence comparison","live vaccines","point mutations","world","severity comparable","vaccinated broiler chicken flocks","recombination","Massachusetts","onset respiratory disease","outbreaks","Arkansas","S2","emergence","potential sources of genetic material","different parts","Connecticut","Analysis","fragments"],"language":"en"},

The basic reproduction number for the ith patch in isolation is obtained along with the basic reproduction number of the system of patches, \u211C(0). Inequalities describing the relationship between these numbers are also given. For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of \u211C(0) on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control. Under the set of parameter values used, our results demonstrate that if border control is properly implemented, then it could contribute to stopping the spatial spread of disease between patches.","publish_time":"2007-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; van den Driessche, P.; Wang, Lin","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11c3ed8ebe5d61b4b29d6569dc53a691ce304638.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high prevalence patch","low prevalence patch","ith patch","disease control","travel of infectives","different level of disease prevalence","disease-prevalent","spatial spread of disease","system of patches","results","impact of travel","travel rates","basic reproduction number","resulting number of infectives","combined number of infectives","border control","travel of symptomatic travelers","parameter values relevant","travel of infected individuals","set of parameter values","certain ranges of parameter values","dependence of \u211C","multipatch model","diseasefree","outbreak","containment","influenza","isolation","Inequalities","relationship","numbers"],"language":"en"},

Protein GP5 and M have been considered very important to arouse the humoral and cellular immune responses against PRRSV infection and proposed to be the excellent candidate proteins in the design of PRRS bioengineering vaccine. There were some attempts on expressing GP5 or M in DNA vaccine and adenovirus to arouse humoral and cellular immune responses, but few papers have been reported on that the immune response can be difference because of the expression patterns of GP5 and M proteins in the recombinant virus. In this article, four recombinant viruses that expressed GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV in the modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) with different expression patterns were made. In these recombinant virus (rMVAs), GP5 and M proteins were expressed in MVA in the same virus but under the control of two promoters (rMVA-GP5/M), or as a fusion protein under one promoter (rMVA-GP5-M), or separately (rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M). The humoral and cellular immune responses for the four recombinant viruses were evaluated with mouse model. Every mouse was inoculated with 5 \u00D7 10(5) TCID(50) of the different rMVAs and boosted 3 weeks later. Neutralizing antibody titers for each group were detected with virus neutralization test assay weekly after the primary inoculation for 13 weeks to evaluate the humoral immune response. The production of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03B3), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) was detected in splenocytes of rMVA-inoculated mice at 30, 60, and 90 days post inoculation to evaluate the cellular immune response. Results showed that rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M cannot induce obvious humoral and cellular immune responses; rMVA-GP5-M inoculated group developed better immune responses than rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M inoculated groups; however, mice inoculated with rMVA-GP5/M maintained the strongest cellular response against PRRS and consistently enhanced the anti-PRRSV humoral responses. The strategy of co-expressing PRRSV GP5 and M protein in MVA under the control of different promoters might be an attractive method for future PRRSV vaccine design.","publish_time":"2007-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Qisheng; Chen, Desheng; Li, Peng; Bi, Zhixiang; Cao, Ruibing; Zhou, Bin; Chen, Puyan","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a9ee72bcc4f4ac1da3b5c3afdc729ffb980f97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088781.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzEwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["N.

Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO\u002BAMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) \u003E0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO\u002BAMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yan-hong; Zhang, Xue-fang; Zhao, Yan-qiu; Bai, Fan; Qin, Fan; Sun, Jing; Dong, Ying","journal":"J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/521a647145ffb1cefd8783cb1395719ad374e53f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzExMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CML","GEO","ATO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Different time-series genes","ATO group","functions of time","AMN107 group","time point","Short Time-series Expression Miner","different expression patterns","drug treatment groups","imatinib-resistant CML cells","functional enrichment analysis of time","cell adhesion","cell proliferation","line treatment of CML","different drug treatments","drug administration","r cells","study","cellular carbohydrate metabolism","cellular carbohydrate metabolic process","functional categories","ratio of standard deviation","average","combination therapy","samples of K562","accumulation of active BCR-ABL protein","arsenic trioxide","DAB2","STEM","AP2M1","coefficient of variation","ribosome","oxidative phosphorylation pathways","GEO database","Chronic myeloid leukemia","antigen processing","CCNA2","differences","patients","GSE24946","DAVID"],"language":"en"},

The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in NDV is low (mean ENC = 56.15 \u003E 40). The good correlation between the (C \u002B G)(12)% and (G \u002B C)(3)% suggests that the mutational pressure, rather than natural selection, is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias and base component in NDV. It is observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in NDV genes is gene function and geography specific, but not host specific. By contrasting synonymous codon usage patterns of different NDV isolates, we suggest that more than one genotype of NDV circulates in waterfowl in USA; and gene length has no significant effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes. CpG under-represented is a characteristic for NDV to fit in its host. These results not only provide an insight into the variation of codon usage pattern among the genomes of NDV, but also may help in understanding the processes governing the evolution of NDV.

Sequencing revealed a single large ORF of 4,149 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,382 amino acids with predicted M (r) of 151 kDa. The coding region of the S gene of attenuated PEDV DR13 had 20 nucleotide changes that appeared to be significant determinants of function in that they produced changes in its predicted amino acid sequence. Notably, attenuated PEDV DR13 has previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. The regions containing these 20 nucleotide changes may therefore be crucial for PEDV pathogenicity. The attenuated PEDV DR13 S protein contains 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons, 21 asparagines that are predicted to be N-glycosylated and a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at positions 1,327\u20131,347, which is predicted to form an \u03B1-helix and to function as a membrane anchor. One (from N to K at 378) of the changes in the deduced amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, while another change (from N to S at 114) created a new one at a different location. These alterations in N-linked glycosylation sites reflected 3 nucleotide changes, which were related to the above-mentioned nucleotide changes and are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated PEDV DR13. Attenuated PEDV DR13 has 96.5, 96.4, 96.1, 93.9, 93.5 and 96.6% DNA sequence identities with CV777, Br1/87, JS-2004-2, Spk1, Chinju99 and parent DR13, respectively. Likewise, it shares 95.7, 95.4, 95.6, 92.0, 91.6 and 95.7% identity with those genes at the deduced amino acid sequence level.

Out of these dysregulated IncRNAs, 43.64% were intergenic, 22.31% were sense, 15.89% were intronic, 8.67% were bidirectional, 5.59% were antisense, 3.85% were sRNA host IncRNAs and 0.05% were enhancer. Six dysregulated IncRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR assays and the secondary structures of these IncRNAs were projected. Moreover, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of an IncRNAs (ENST00000602478) to elucidate the diversity of modification and functions of IncRNAs. In summary, the current study compared the dysregulated IncRNAs profile upon CVA16 challenge and illustrated the intricate relationship between coding and IncRNAs transcripts. These results may not only provide a complete picture of transcription in CVA16 infected cells but also provide novel molecular targets for treatments of HFMD.

In this study, three theoretically effective interference target sites (71\u201391, 144\u2013164, 218\u2013238) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PRRSV were designed and selected, and then three siRNA-expressing plasmids were constructed, respectively named p2.1-N71, p2.1-N144, and p2.1-N218. The recombinant siRNA-expressing plasmids were transfected into Marc-145 cells; then the cells were infected with PRRSV (JL07SW strain); finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those siRNA-expressing plasmids in Marc-145 cells was assessed by cytopathic effects, virus titers, indirect immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. Experimental results demonstrated that these three siRNA-expressing plasmids could effectively and significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by 93.2%, 83.6%, and 89.2% in Marc-145 cells, respectively. Among these three siRNA-expressing plasmids, p2.1-N71 was found to be most effective, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 displayed relatively weak inhibition of virus replication. The results indicated that siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N gene of PRRSV could significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. Based on our experimental results and previous reports, the 71\u201391, 179\u2013197, and 234\u2013252 sites of the N gene are good choices to effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV, and this RNA interference technique can be a potential anti-PRRSV strategy.","publish_time":"2014-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Minnan; Xiang, Qun; Zhang, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Sylla, Seydou; Ding, Zhuang","journal":"J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c6829b1eab14db035d2515be4843548c9e7fe2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasmids","p2","replication of PRRSV","PRRSV replication","cells","N gene of PRRSV","Marc","recombinant siRNA","potential anti-PRRSV strategy","Experimental results","effective interference target sites","weak inhibition of virus replication","effective protection","N218","N144","N71","virus titers","antiviral activity","RNA interference technique","current antiviral strategies","indirect immunofluorescence","cytopathic effects","swine","severe economic losses","respiratory syndrome","quantitative real-time PCR","good choices","areas","important disease","incubation","previous reports","study","JL07SW strain","nucleocapsid","world"],"language":"en"},

The goal of this study was to determine the recovery efficiencies and the survival of two respiratory viruses, namely, adenovirus 2 (Ad2) and coronavirus 229E (CoV229E), on fresh produce in comparison to the enteric poliovirus 1 (PV1). Adenovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 56.5, 31.8, and 34.8 % from lettuce, strawberries, and raspberries, respectively. Coronavirus was recovered from lettuce with an efficiency of 19.6 % yet could not be recovered from strawberries. Poliovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 76.7 % from lettuce, but only 0.06 % from strawberries. For comparison purposes, the survival of Ad2, CoV229E, and PV1 was determined for periods up to 10 days on produce. The enteric PV1 survived better than both respiratory viruses on lettuce and strawberries, with only \u22641.03 log(10) reductions after 10 days of storage at 4 \u00B0C compared to CoV229E not being recovered after 4 days on lettuce and reductions of 1.97 log(10) and 2.38 log(10) of Ad2 on lettuce and strawberries, respectively, after 10 days. Nevertheless, these respiratory viruses were able to survive for at least several days on produce. There is therefore the potential for transfer to the hands and subsequently to the mucosa via rubbing the eyes or nose. In addition, some respiratory coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and adenoviruses are also capable of replication in the gut and there is thus some potential for acquisition through the consumption of contaminated produce.","publish_time":"2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Y\u00E9piz-G\u00F3mez, M.

Sliding doors can reduce the containment failure arising from the door motion induced airflows, as compared to the hinged doors that are typically used in healthcare facilities. Such airflow leakage can be measured quantitatively using tracer gas techniques, but detailed observation of the turbulent flow features is very difficult. However, a comprehensive understanding of these flows is important when designing doors to further reduce such containment failures. Experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) flow solver, were used to study airflow patterns in a full-scale mock-up, consisting of a sliding door separating two identical rooms (i.e. one isolation room attached to an antechamber). A single sliding door open/ hold-open/ closing cycle was studied. Additional variables included human passage through the doorway and imposing a temperature difference between the two rooms. The general structures of computationally-simulated flow features were validated by comparing the results to smoke visualizations of identical full-scale experimental set-ups. It was found that without passage the air volume leakage across the doorway was first dominated by vortex shedding in the wake of the door, but during a prolonged hold-open period a possible temperature difference soon became the predominant driving force. Passage generates a short and powerful pulse of leakage flow rate even if the walker stops to wait for the door to open.

The incidence of grades II\u2013lV acute GVHD in the group of HLA-identical patients was 35% in the PBSCT group and 25% in the BMT group (P \u003C 0.33, log-rank). However, there was a significant difference (P \u003C 0.05, log-rank) in incidence and time to onset of acute GVHD II\u2013IV comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. Disease-free survival was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days for PBSC and BMT transplants, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT led to significantly faster leukocyte engraftment but is associated with a higher incidence and more rapid onset of severe acute GVHD comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. However, the incidence of severe acute GVHD in HLA-identical patients was not different between the PBSCT and BMT groups.

Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] \u003C 50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of \u003E50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below \u003C30 nmol/L (or 12 ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amrein, Karin; Scherkl, Mario; Hoffmann, Magdalena; Neuwersch-Sommeregger, Stefan; K\u00F6stenberger, Markus; Tmava Berisha, Adelina; Martucci, Gennaro; Pilz, Stefan; Malle, Oliver","journal":"Eur J Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/190e7d9721946a9e5486a683437056f19ff2b3d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vitamin D"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vitamin D testing","Severe vitamin D deficiency","hydroxyvitamin D","D level","D concentration","vitamin D replete populations","vitamin D-replete populations","optimal vitamin D dose","role of vitamin D supplementation","use of vitamin D supplements","systematic vitamin D food fortification","OH","nmol","large interventional studies","clear benefit","well-designed studies","diseases","data","inconsistent intervention methods","nutrient intervention study","risk of excess mortality","worldwide public health intervention","prevention of infections","certain risk groups","small sample sizes","current international literature","status","fractures","safe adjuvant therapy","subject of debate","basic requirements","relevance","serum","effects","unfavorable skeletal outcomes","narrative review","metabolites","panacea","wide safety margin","bone loss","deficient individuals","primary treatment goal","trial design","therapeutic options","recent years","higher threshold","limitations"],"language":"en"},

The E protein is an integral membrane protein. Its C-terminal region extends cytoplasmically in the infected cell and in the virion toward the interior. The N-terminal two-thirds of the E protein is hydrophobic and lies buried within the membrane, but its orientation in the lipid membrane is not known. Immunofluorescent analyses of cells expressing biologically active murine coronavirus E protein with a hydrophilic short epitope tag at the N-terminus showed that the epitope tag was exposed cytoplasmically. Immunoprecipitation analyses of the purified microsomal membrane vesicles that contain the same tagged E protein revealed the N-terminal epitope tag outside the microsomal membrane vesicles.

Our data were consistent with an E protein topology model, in which the N-terminal two-thirds of the transmembrane domain spans the lipid bilayer twice, exposing the C-terminal region to the cytoplasm or virion interior.","publish_time":"2001-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maeda, Junko; Repass, John F.; Maeda, Akihiko; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78e17a104e6974cb01f894b2578534998e647bc5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201908189; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201908189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tagged E protein","integral membrane protein","E protein topology model","active murine coronavirus E protein","N-terminal epitope tag","Abstract Coronavirus small envelope protein E","N-terminus","lipid membrane","C-terminal region","hydrophilic short epitope tag","purified microsomal membrane vesicles","thirds","Immunofluorescent analyses of cells","Immunoprecipitation analyses","virion interior","cultured cells","lipid bilayer","virus envelope formation","known biological functions","apoptosis","pivotal role","cytoplasm","transmembrane domain","infected cell","orientation","data"],"language":"en"},

Although, medical technology has tried to handle the problems, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the prevention, post exposure, or treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS: In the present study, we used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of EBOV. BioEdit v7.2.3 sequence alignment editor, Jalview v2 and CLC Sequence Viewer v7.0.2 were used for the initial sequence analysis for securing the conservancy from the sequences. Later the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) was used for the identification of T-cell and B-cellepitopes associated with type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules analysis. Finally, the population coverage analysis was employed. RESULTS: The core epitope \u201CFRYEFTAPF\u201D was found to be the most potential one, with 100 % conservancy among all the strains of EBOV. It also interacted with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered as nonallergenic in nature. Finally, with impressive cumulative population coverage of 99.87 % for the both MHC-I and MHC-II class throughout the world population was found for the proposed epitope. CONCLUSION: To end, the projected peptide gave us a solid stand to propose for vaccine consideration and that might be experimented for its potency in eliciting immunity through humoral and cell mediated immune responses in vitro and in vivo.

Grasping the principles of host-microbiota interactions (HMIs) at the molecular level is important since it may provide insights into the mechanisms of infections. The crosstalk between the host and the microbiota may help resolve puzzling questions such as how a microorganism can contribute to both health and disease. Integrated superorganism networks that consider host and microbiota as a whole\u2013may uncover their code, clarifying perhaps the most fundamental question: how they modulate immune surveillance. Within this framework, structural HMI networks can uniquely identify potential microbial effectors that target distinct host nodes or interfere with endogenous host interactions, as well as how mutations on either host or microbial proteins affect the interaction. Furthermore, structural HMIs can help identify master host cell regulator nodes and modules whose tweaking by the microbes promote aberrant activity. Collectively, these data can delineate pathogenic mechanisms and thereby help maximize beneficial therapeutics. To date, challenges in experimental techniques limit large-scale characterization of HMIs. Here we highlight an area in its infancy which we believe will increasingly engage the computational community: predicting interactions across kingdoms, and mapping these on the host cellular networks to figure out how commensal and pathogenic microbiota modulate the host signaling and broadly cross-species consequences.","publish_time":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guven-Maiorov, Emine; Tsai, Chung-Jung; Nussinov, Ruth","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91276b1c72c7bff1b7b796b8efaa9215519289a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5638203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023448/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Integrated","HMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["principles of host","host cellular networks","endogenous host interactions","distinct host nodes","microbiota interactions","pathogenic microbiota","role of microbiota","master host cell regulator nodes","structural HMIs","structural HMI networks","pathogenic mechanisms","health","disease","large-scale characterization of HMIs","Integrated superorganism networks","microbial proteins","mechanisms of infections","potential microbial effectors","Hundreds of different species","growing body of data","cross-species consequences","tweaking","modules","experimental techniques","challenges","multicellular organisms","mapping","microbes","kingdoms","mutations","molecular level","fundamental question","aberrant activity","date","insights","microorganism","computational community","puzzling questions","framework","immune surveillance","beneficial therapeutics","metaorganisms","crosstalk","area","infancy","code"],"language":"en"},

On one hand, pathogens were shown to manipulate host encoded enzymes. On the other hand, pathogen derived sequences of proteases specific for Ub/Ubls are emerging as a common feature shared by many viruses, bacteria and protozoa, and we are at an early stage of understanding how these proteases contribute to the pathogenesis of infection. Whereas some of these proteases share a common origin with mammalian cell encoded hydrolases with specific properties towards Ub/Ubls, most of them have ancient intrinsic functions, such as processing pathogen protein components, and may have acquired the specificity for Ub/Ubls by interacting with mammalian hosts and their immune system throughout evolution.

However, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. This study reveals that EV71 infection in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and neuroblastoma (SK\u2010N\u2010SH) cells stimulated the autophagic process, which was demonstrated by an increase of punctate GFP\u2010microtubule\u2010associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP\u2010LC3), the level of autophagosome\u2010bound LC3\u2010II protein and double\u2010membrane autophagosome formation. EV71\u2010induced autophagy benefited EV71 replication, which was confirmed by the autophagic inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3\u2010methyladenine. Signaling pathway investigation revealed that the decreased expression of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated p70S6K is involved in EV71\u2010induced autophagy in a cell\u2010specific manner. The expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (Erk) was suppressed consistently in EV71\u2010infected cells. However it did not participate in the autophagic response of the cell. Other signaling pathway molecules, such as Erk, PI3K/Akt, Bcl\u20102, BNIP3, and Beclin\u20101 were not affected by infection with EV71. Electron microscopy showed co\u2010localization of autophagosome\u2010like vesicles with either EV71\u2010VP1 or LC3 protein in neurons of the cervical spinal cord in ICR mice infected with EV71. In conclusion, EV71 infection triggered autophagic flux and induced autophagosome formation both in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy induced by EV71 is beneficial for viral replication. Understanding the role of autophagy induced by EV71 in vitro and the formation of autophagosome\u2010like vesicle in vivo provide new insights into the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. J. Med.

We analyzed data on endemic fluorosis collected in Ningxia, a typical high-fluorine area in the north of China. Fluorosis cases were identified in 539 villages in 1981, in 4449 villages in 2010, and in 3269 villages in 2017. These were located in 19 administrative counties. In 2017, a total of 1.07 million individuals suffered from fluorosis in Ningxia, with more children suffering from dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis. Among Qingshuihe River basin disease areas, the high incidence of endemic fluorosis is in Yuanzhou District and Xiji County of Guyuan City. The paper holds that the genesis of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis in Qingshui River basin is mainly caused by chemical weathering, evaporation and concentration, and dissolution of fluorine-containing rocks around the basin, which is also closely related to the semi-arid geographical region background, basin structure, groundwater chemical characteristics, and climatic conditions of the basin. The process of mutual recharge and transformation between Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin is intense. There is a close coupling relationship between the power of central and southern Ningxia disease areas and Qingshui River watershed of excess fluorine water. Because the traditional drinking water source of the residents in the basin is shallow groundwater, the underground water is the main cause of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis. The results show that Xiji County and Yuanzhou District were the areas of high incidence of endemic fluorosis which gradually decreased to the middle and lower reaches of Qingshui River. In space, distribution characteristics are Qingshui River source area \u003E Qingshui River valley basin area, tributary area \u003E trunk stream area, upstream area \u003E middle reaches area\u003E downstream area of Qingshui River. This is relatively consistent with the spatial distribution of fluoride ion content in Qingshui River groundwater.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Mingji; Qu, Xiangning; Miao, Hong; Wen, Shengjin; Hua, Zhaoyang; Ma, Zhenghu; He, Zhirun","journal":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50cde3d268d9b4a60cb6bf6aa16a04fc0886b9de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239411/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08451-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Qingshuihe River","Qingshui River"],"keyphrases":["Qingshui River basin","Qingshui River groundwater","Qingshui River valley basin area","Qingshui River source area","downstream area of Qingshui River","areas of high incidence of endemic fluorosis","dental fluorosis","skeletal fluorosis","Fluorosis cases","lower reaches of Qingshui River","Qingshuihe River basin disease areas","typical high-fluorine area","tributary area","upstream area","Qingshui River watershed of excess fluorine water","basin structure","middle reaches area","trunk stream area","shallow groundwater","fluorine content","villages","groundwater chemical characteristics","semi-arid areas of northwest China","southern Ningxia disease areas","underground water","dissolution of fluorine","consumption of drinking water","traditional drinking water source","Yuanzhou District","distribution characteristics","north of China","semi-arid geographical region background","chemical weathering","Xiji County of Guyuan City","spatial distribution of fluoride ion content","power of central","transformation","residents","main cause","concentration","climatic conditions","children","process of mutual recharge","evaporation","genesis","close coupling relationship","space","results","individuals","rocks","data","administrative counties","total","paper"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, I argue that topological explanations, which have been described in ecology or in cognitive sciences, can also be found in medicine and I discuss the relationships between mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine, through the example of network medicine and medical genetics. Network medicine is a recent discipline that relies on the analysis of various disease networks (including disease-gene networks) in order to find organizing principles in disease explanation. My aim is to show how topological explanations in network medicine can help solving the conceptual issues that pure mechanistic explanations of the genetics of disease are currently facing, namely the crisis of the concept of genetic disease, the progressive geneticization of diseases and the dissolution of the distinction between monogenic and polygenic diseases. However, I will also argue that topological explanations should not be considered as independent and radically different from mechanistic explanations for at least two reasons. First, in network medicine, topological explanations depend on and use mechanistic information. Second, they leave out some missing gaps in disease explanation that require, in turn, the development of new mechanistic explanations. Finally, I will insist on the specific contribution of topological explanations in medicine: they push us to develop an explanation of disease in general, instead of focusing on single explanations of individual diseases. This last point may have major consequences for biomedical research.","publish_time":"2015-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Darrason, Marie","journal":"Synthese","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12af471f81b05440047e30b963b3733bd6f33693.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089272.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0983-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Medical explanations","pure mechanistic explanations","disease explanation","explanation of disease","development of new mechanistic explanations","specific contribution of topological explanations","genetics of disease","single explanations of individual diseases","example of network medicine","mechanistic information","disease-gene networks","concept of genetic disease","analysis of various disease networks","polygenic diseases","medical genetics","progressive geneticization of diseases","biological dysfunction","model of biological ones","order","conceptual issues","dissolution","distinction","turn","organizing principles","major consequences","recent discipline","relationships","biomedical research","point","crisis","missing gaps","ecology","cognitive sciences","paper","aim","reasons"],"language":"en"},

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-\u03B1 in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-\u03B1. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-\u03B1 secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-\u03B1-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80\u002B/iNOS\u002B cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-\u03B1-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80\u002B/CD206\u002B cells) were increased. These results may suggest a new cell-based therapeutic option for treating IBD.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Woo-Jin; Li, Qiang; Ryu, Min-Ok; Nam, Aryung; An, Ju-Hyun; Jung, Yun Chan; Ahn, Jin-Ok; Youn, Hwa-Young","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7161522ddfb7d0ae8980540ac960978af964d828.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111869.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818353542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247473/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818353542; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.06.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-treated cAT-MSCs","TNF-\u03B1 secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors","IBD treatment","IL","Mice","underlying mechanisms of IBD","DNBS-induced colitis","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","mouse models of IBD","pro-inflammatory cytokines","colonic inflammatory cytokines","therapeutic effects","induced gene","alternative therapeutic option","TSG","colon tissues","F4","M2 macrophages","Colitis severity","M1 macrophages","PGE2","results","secretion of soluble factors","Mesenchymal stem cells","Abstract Canine inflammatory bowel disease","ameliorated DSS","corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue","enhanced anti-inflammatory properties","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid","intractable autoimmune disorder","interleukin","flow cytometry analysis","key role","veterinary medicine","dextran sulfate sodium","phenotypic alterations","new cell","protein","systemic symptoms","study","prostaglandin E2","iNOS","CD206","aim"],"language":"en"},

We determined pooled odds ratios for the literature analysis and compared these to odds ratios based on the clinical cohort dataset. This combined analysis suggested significant associations between influenza and fever or headache, as well as between respiratory syncytial virus infection and cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Similarly, literature and cohort data agreed on significant associations between HMPV infection and cough, as well as adenovirus infection and fever. Importantly, none of the abovementioned features were unique to any particular pathogen but were also observed in association with other respiratory viruses. In summary, our \u201Creal\u2010world\u201D dataset confirmed published literature trends, but no individual feature allows any particular type of viral infection to be ruled in or ruled out.

Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liermann, W.; Sch\u00E4ff, C.

Therefore, surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. METHODS: A total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children (\u003C6 years, crossing border between Southern China and Hong Kong SAR) showing symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever (body temperature \u003E 37.5 \u00B0C), from 2014 May to 2015 Dec. Viral nucleic acids were analyzed and sequenced to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of the four human coronaviruses. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated with Fisher chi-square test. RESULTS: 78 (2.37%; 95%CI 1.8-2.8%) out of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were found to be positive for OC43 (36;1.09%), HKU1 (34; 1.03%), NL63 (6; 0.18%) and 229E (2;0.01%). None of SARS or MERS was detected. The HCoVs predominant circulating season was in transition of winter to spring, especially January and February and NL63 detected only in summer and fall. Complex population with an abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses was circulating and they shared homology with the published strains (99-100%). Besides, phylogenetic evolutionary analysis indicated that OC43 coronaviruses were clustered into three clades (B,D,E), HKU1 clustered into two clades(A,B) and NL63 clustered into two clades(A,B). Moreover, several novel mutations including nucleotides substitution and the insertion of spike of the glycoprotein on the viral surface were discovered. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate and epidemic trend of coronaviruses were stable and no obvious fluctuations were found. The detected coronaviruses shared a conserved gene sequences in S and RdRp. However, mutants of the epidemic strains were detected, suggesting continuous monitoring of the human coronaviruses is in need among cross-border children, who are more likely to get infected and transmit the viruses across the border easily, in addition to the general public.","publish_time":"2017-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Peilin; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Wei; He, Jianan; Liu, Chunxiao; Zhao, Chunzhong; Kong, Siu Kai; Loo, Jacky Fong Chuen; Gu, Dayong; Hu, Longfei","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c890cb0b691543c29b35b5a1351ff8c990739fe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5700739.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166910/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0896-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["SARS","MERS"],"locations":["Guangdong","Southern China","China","Hong Kong SAR"],"keyphrases":["detected coronaviruses","OC43 coronaviruses","outbreak of human coronaviruses","epidemic trend of coronaviruses","abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses","clades","NL63","cross-border children","Hong Kong SAR of China","SARS","epidemic strains","prevalence","region","HKU1","HCoVs predominant circulating season","nasopharyngeal swabs samples","nasopharyngeal swabs specimens","Southern China","virus variation of HCoVs circulation","published strains","viral surface","Viral nucleic acids","Guangdong province","conserved gene sequences","symptoms of respiratory tract infection","data","nucleotides substitution","fever","insertion of spike","transition of winter","detection rate","years","need","continuous monitoring","RdRp","glycoprotein","total","Complex population","recombination","phylogenetic evolutionary analysis","decade","body temperature","novel mutations","Fisher chi-square test","CONCLUSIONS","addition","obvious fluctuations","homology","general public","statistical significance","reoccurrence","spring","METHODS","surveillance","summer","fall","mutants","BACKGROUND","MERS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The filovirus VP40 matrix protein is essential for virus assembly and budding, and its PPxY L-domain motif interacts with WW-domains of specific host proteins, such as Nedd4 and ITCH, to facilitate the late stage of virus-cell separation. To identify additional WW-domain-bearing host proteins that interact with VP40, we used an EBOV PPxY-containing peptide to screen an array of 115 mammalian WW-domain-bearing proteins. Using this unbiased approach, we identified BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3 (BAG3), a member of the BAG family of molecular chaperone proteins, as a specific VP40 PPxY interactor. Here, we demonstrate that the WW-domain of BAG3 interacts with the PPxY motif of both EBOV and MARV VP40 and, unexpectedly, inhibits budding of both eVP40 and mVP40 virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as infectious VSV-EBOV recombinants. BAG3 is a stress induced protein that regulates cellular protein homeostasis and cell survival through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Interestingly, our results show that BAG3 alters the intracellular localization of VP40 by sequestering VP40 away from the plasma membrane. As BAG3 is the first WW-domain interactor identified that negatively regulates budding of VP40 VLPs and infectious virus, we propose that the chaperone-mediated autophagy function of BAG3 represents a specific host defense strategy to counteract the function of VP40 in promoting efficient egress and spread of virus particles.","publish_time":"2017-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Jingjing; Sagum, Cari A.; Bedford, Mark T.; Sidhu, Sachdev S.; Sudol, Marius; Han, Ziying; Harty, Ronald N.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0072159e1ebecc889e9bcabb58bb45c47e18a403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5226679.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28076420/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Associated Athanogene","BAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of VP40","MARV VP40","budding of VP40 VLPs","specific VP40 PPxY interactor","WW-domain interactor","EBOV PPxY","mammalian WW-domain","additional WW-domain","infectious virus","virus particles","domain motif","specific host proteins","intracellular localization of VP40","filovirus VP40 matrix protein","virus assembly","chaperone-mediated autophagy function of BAG3","mVP40 virus","WW-domains","PPxY motif","late stage of virus","BAG family of molecular chaperone proteins","specific host defense strategy","infectious VSV-EBOV recombinants","cellular protein homeostasis","stress induced protein","cell survival","Filoviridae family","cell separation","viruses","members","Marburg","efficient egress","ITCH","BCL2","array","eVP40","Nedd4","outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever","Athanogene","CMA","peptide","unbiased approach","Ebola","results","plasma membrane"],"language":"en"},

In the province of British Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF) Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the health authority website. METHODS: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator. Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and conducted a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged concerning implementation of the CF Framework generally, and the two programs specifically. The themes were: \u2018you\u2019ve told me what, now tell me how\u2019; \u2018the double bind\u2019; \u2018but we already do that\u2019; and the \u2018selling game.\u2019 Findings demonstrate the original vision of the CF process was lost in the implementation process and many participants were unaware of the CF framework or process. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed with respect to a well-known framework on the adoption, assimilation, and implementation of innovations in health services organizations. Despite attempts of the Ministry of Health and the Steering Committee to develop and implement a collaborative, evidence-informed policy intervention, there were several barriers to the realization of the vision for core public health functions implementation, at least in the early stages. In neglecting the implementation process, it seems unlikely that the expected benefits of the public health renewal process will be realized.","publish_time":"2013-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomm-Bonde, Laura; Schreiber, Rita S; Allan, Diane E; MacDonald, Marjorie; Pauly, Bernie; Hancock, Trevor","journal":"Implement Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9d84fcde35a82c200f779df24657558638bf40b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3680003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734672/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-8-59","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Ministry of Health","Core Functions","CF"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["health authorities","Ministry of Health","core public health programs","public health renewal process","core public health functions implementation","implementation process","CF process","CF implementation","renewed public health services","health authority website","health services organizations","CF Framework","high profile public health crises","Core Functions","CF coordinator","concerning implementation","implementation of innovations","collaborative evidence-informed process","model core program paper","Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs","well-known framework","embedded knowledge translation process","development","evidence review","RESULTS","Interviews","groups","evidence-informed policy intervention","steering committee of representatives","original vision","gap analysis","thematic analysis","main themes","project coordinator","Healthy Living","performance improvement plan","expected benefits","assimilation","response","participants","line staff","NVivo","data","barriers","respect","adoption","realization","Canada","province of British Columbia","research team","members","managers","early stages","total","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Findings","METHODS","attempts","documents","double bind","game"],"language":"en"},

Virus replication assay in 17C1-1 cells showed the plaque phenotype and replication characterization of constructed Wu\u201D-ts18(cd) were indistinguishable from the reported ts mutant Wu\u201D-ts18.

The single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 76 or position 130 could also revert the ts mutant Wu\u201D-ts18 (cd) to non-ts phenotype, an additional independent mutation in Nsp13 position 115 played an important role on plaque size. The results provided us with genetic information on the functional determinants of Nsp16.

Currently available methods allow bulk analysis of vesicles but are not suited for accurate quantification and fail to reveal phenotypic heterogeneity in membrane vesicle populations. For such analyses, single vesicle-based, multiparameter, high-throughput methods are needed. We developed a fluorescence-based, high-resolution flow cytometric method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of nanosized membrane vesicles. Proof of principle was obtained by single-particle analysis of virions and liposomes. Further validation was obtained by quantification of cell-derived nanosized membrane vesicles from cell cultures and body fluids. An important aspect was that the technology was extended to detect specific proteins on individual vesicles. This allowed identification of exosome subsets and phenotyping of individual exosomes produced by dendritic cells (DCs) undergoing different modes of activation. The described technology allows quantitative, multiparameter, and high-throughput analysis of a wide variety of nanosized particles and has broad applications.

In Shigella, IpaD gene is one of the key pathogenic genes causing strong mucosal immune system reactions. Anthrax disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis. PA protective antigen is one of the subunits in anthrax toxin complex responsible for the transfer of other subunits into the cytosol of host cells. The 20 kDa subunit of PA (PA20) has the property of immunogenicity. CTxB or B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) is a non-toxic protein and has the function to transfer toxic subunit into cytosol of the host cells by binding to GM1 receptor. The aim of this study was to fuse PA20, ipaD and CTxB and transform tomato plants by this cassette in order to produce an oral vaccine against shigellosis, anthrax and cholera. CTxB was used for these two antigens as an immune adjuvant. IpaD and PA20 genes were cloned in pBI121 containing the CTxB gene and Extensin signal peptide. In order to evaluate the transient expression of Shigellosis, Anthrax and Cholera antigens, agro-infiltrated tomato tissues were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the gene cassette. Cloning was confirmed by PCR, enzymatic digestion and sequencing techniques. Expression of the antigens was examined by SDS-PAGE, dot blot and ELISA. Maturate green fruits demonstrated the highest expression of the recombinant proteins. The first phase of this study was carried out for cloning and expressing of CtxB, ipaD and PA20 antigens in tomato. In the next phase, we aim to analyze the immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in laboratory animals.","publish_time":"2018-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davod, Jafari; Fatemeh, Dehghan Nayeri; Honari, Hossein; Hosseini, Ramin","journal":"Mol Biol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cff28b278c5d4574b33576dee4e8bbbafe83df8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088786.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4385-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella"],"organizations":["Vibrio"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PA20 antigens","CTxB gene","IpaD gene","Cholera antigens","PA20 genes","Anthrax disease","gene cassette","transient expression of Shigellosis","subunits","anthrax toxin complex responsible","cytosol of host cells","tomato plants","toxic subunit","highest expression","kDa subunit of PA","order","transfer","Cloning","study","aim","phase","B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin","agro-infiltrated tomato tissues","oral vaccine","vaccine candidate","immune adjuvant","property of immunogenicity","Shigella dysenteriae","key pathogenic genes","PA protective antigen","strong mucosal immune system reactions","PCR","function","binding","Agrobacterium","pBI121","enzymatic digestion","SDS-PAGE","health of human society","Extensin signal peptide","dot blot","sequencing techniques","GM1 receptor","developing countries","non-toxic protein","laboratory animals","ELISA","green fruits","recombinant proteins","diseases","Bacillus anthracis"],"language":"en"},

Elucidating the mechanistic details of this pathway could unlock a large store of information useful to the design of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Proteomic approaches to the questions at hand have generally utilized mass spectrometry (MS), which has been successful in identifying both ubiquitylation substrates and profiling pan-cellular chain linkages, but is generally unable to connect the two. Interacting partners of the deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) have also been reported by MS, although substrates of catalytically competent DUBs generally cannot be. Where they have been used towards the study of ubiquitylation, protein microarrays have usually functioned as platforms for the identification of substrates for specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we report on the first use of protein microarrays to identify substrates of DUBs, and in so doing demonstrate the first example of microarray proteomics involving multiple (i.e., distinct, sequential and opposing) enzymatic activities. This technique demonstrates the selectivity of DUBs for both substrate and type (mono- versus poly-) of ubiquitylation. This work shows that the vast majority of DUBs are monoubiquitylated in vitro, and are incapable of removing this modification from themselves. This work also underscores the critical role of utilizing both ubiquitin chains and substrates when attempting to characterize DUBs.

While there has been a documented recent decline in the incidence of stroke in several Western nations due to better risk factor management, much less is known about the nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia over the last decade. The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study by reviewing all hospitalized patients (\u2265 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke between 2001 and 2011 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. RESULTS: A total of 291,381 first-ever ischemic stroke patients were enrolled between 2000 and 2011. The average age was about 70 years and approximately 58.6% of them were men. While prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, as well as use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and oral anticoagulant agents for atrial fibrillation significantly increased; incidence (142.3 vs. 129.5 per 100,000 in 2000 and 2011, respectively) and one-year recurrence (9.6% vs. 7.8% in 2000 and 2011, respectively) of stroke declined during this period of time.

Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9\u20132.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5\u20134.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1\u201326.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p \u003C 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4837e80ebfab608cd7efc3f26efe601a5410fbd3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181488/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","international COVID","Chinese lockdown measures","China","growth curves of COVID","number of confirmed COVID","weaker following lockdown","CI","increased doubling time of cases","correlation of domestic air traffic","significant changes","significant increase","days","enormous measures","growth rate","population of Wuhan","diagnostic criteria","public health emergency of international concern","World Health Organization","PHEIC","high risk areas","development","outbreak","stringent confinement of people","findings","available data","potential","countries","flight restrictions","Confidence Interval","epicenter","entire Hubei province","testing methodology","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2\u20133 months post-hospital discharge. Results Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV1 of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (\u003E1000mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p =0.02).

There are two biotypes of BVDV: non-cytopathic (NCP) and cytopathic (CP). One strategy that has been used to treat or prevent virus-associated diseases is the modulation of autophagy, which is used by the innate immune system to defend against viral infection; however, at present, the interplay between autophagy and BVDV remains unclear. Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells stably expressing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-LC3-MDBK cells) and autophagy-deficient MDBKs (shBCN1-MDBK cells) were constructed. Then MDBK, GFP-LC3-MDBK and shBCN1-MDBK cells were infected with CP or NCP BVDV strains. The LC3-II turnover rate was estimated by western blot, autophagosomes were visualized by confocal microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis was performed using electron microscopy. Autophagy flux was observed using chloroquine as an inhibitor of the autophagic process. The influence of autophagy on BVDV replication and release was investigated using virus titration, and its effect on cell viability was also studied. The effect of BVDV-induced autophagy on the survival of BVDV-infected host cell, cell apoptosis, and interferon (IFN) signalling was studied by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-(q)PCR using shBCN1-MDBK cells. we found that infection with either CP or NCP BVDV strains induced steady-state autophagy in MDBK cells, as evident by the increased number of double- or single-membrane vesicles, the accumulation of GFP- microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) dots, and the conversion of LC3-I (cytosolic) to LC3-II (membrane-bound) forms. The complete autophagic process was verified by monitoring the LC3-II turnover ratio, lysosomal delivery, and proteolysis. In addition, we found that CP and NCP BVDV growth was inhibited in MDBK cells treated with high levels of an autophagy inducer or inhibitor, or in autophagy deficient-MDBK cells. Furthermore, our studies also suggested that CP and NCP BVDV infection in autophagy-knockdown MDBK cells increased apoptotic cell death and enhanced the expression of the mRNAs for IFN-\u03B1, Mx1, IFN-\u03B2, and OAS-1 as compared with control MDBK cells. Our study provides strong evidence that BVDV infection induces autophagy, which facilitates BVDV replication in MDBK cells and impairs the innate immune response. These findings might help to illustrate the pathogenesis of persistent infection caused by BVDV.","publish_time":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yulong; Ren, Yachao; Cong, Yanlong; Mu, Yu; Yin, Renfu; Ding, Zhuang","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5210ba06ec25eeda258e77459c4b1305443b9355.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28702931/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3482-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV","NCP BVDV","MDBK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy deficient-MDBK cells","autophagy-knockdown MDBK cells","shBCN1-MDBK cells","control MDBK cells","NCP BVDV infection","BVDV replication","effect of BVDV","survival of BVDV","biotypes of BVDV","NCP BVDV strains","induced autophagy","NCP BVDV growth","autophagy inducer","modulation of autophagy","influence of autophagy","Autophagy flux","GFP-LC3","autophagy-deficient MDBKs","steady-state autophagy","conversion of LC3","viral infection","Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells","microtubule-associated protein","cell apoptosis","accumulation of GFP","cell viability","infected host cell","virus-associated diseases","pathogenesis of persistent infection","apoptotic cell death","light chain","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B2","Bovine viral diarrhea virus","virus titration","inhibitor","green fluorescent protein","innate immune system","innate immune response","complete autophagic process","ultrastructural analysis","turnover ratio","confocal microscopy","turnover rate","electron microscopy","flow cytometric analysis","single-membrane vesicles","increased number of double","quantitative RT","LC3B","PCR","high levels","signalling","Mx1","expression","interferon","dots","strong evidence","release","western blot","lysosomal delivery","autophagosomes","mRNAs","important pathogen of cattle","chloroquine","study","interplay","present","complex role","proteolysis","OAS","studies","findings","forms","addition","strategy"],"language":"en"},

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital. METHODS: Patient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad. Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders. We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV. FINDINGS: Initial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea. Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Both patients developed acute renal failure. MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22\u00B79 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22\u00B75 for upE and 23\u00B79 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive. The two patients shared the same room for 3 days. The incubation period was estimated at 9\u201312 days for the second case. No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: Patients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days. Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.

The Swine Health Monitoring Project (SHMP) monitors and reports weekly new PRRS cases in 766 sow herds across the US. The time-dependent reproduction number (TD-R) is a measure of a pathogen\u2019s transmissibility. It may serve to capture and report PRRS virus (PRRSV) spread at the regional and system levels. The primary objective of the study here was to estimate the TD-R values for PRRSV using regional and system-level PRRS data, and to contrast it with commonly used metrics of disease, such as incidence estimates and space\u2013time clusters. The second objective was to test whether the estimated TD-Rs were homogenous across four US regions. Retrospective monthly incidence data (2009\u20132016) were available from the SHMP. The dataset was divided into four regions based on location of participants, and demographic and environmental features, namely, South East (North Carolina), Upper Midwest East (UME, Minnesota/Iowa), Upper Midwest West (Nebraska/South Dakota), and South (Oklahoma panhandle). Generation time distributions were fit to incidence data for each region, and used to calculate the TD-Rs. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to determine whether the median TD-Rs differed across the four areas. Furthermore, we used a space\u2013time permutation model to assess spatial\u2013temporal patterns for the four regions. Results showed TD-Rs were right skewed with median values close to \u201C1\u201D across all regions, confirming that PRRS has an overall endemic nature. Variation in the TD-R patterns was noted across regions and production systems. Statistically significant periods of PRRSV spread (TD-R \u003E 1) were identified for all regions except UME. A minimum of three space\u2013time clusters were detected for all regions considering the time period examined herein; and their overlap with \u201Cspreader events\u201D identified by the TD-R method varied according to region. TD-Rs may help to measure PRRS spread to understand, in quantitative terms, disease spread, and, ultimately, support the design, implementation, and monitoring of interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of PRRSV spread in the US.","publish_time":"2017-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arruda, Andr\u00E9ia G.; Alkhamis, Moh A.; VanderWaal, Kimberly; Morrison, Robert B.; Perez, Andres M.","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8f4d22d624e8deec9597ce88e53b1751386cd1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5380673.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28424778/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Swine Health Monitoring Project","SHMP","PRRS","UME"],"locations":["South East"],"keyphrases":["TD-R patterns","TD-R values","median TD-Rs","TD-R method","estimated TD-Rs","US regions","time clusters","disease spread","time period","system-level PRRS data","space","time permutation model","report PRRS virus","Generation time distributions","used metrics of disease","South East","impact of PRRSV","weekly new PRRS cases","time-dependent reproduction number","Upper Midwest East","South Dakota","incidence estimates","SHMP","impactful disease","Retrospective monthly incidence data","significant periods of PRRSV","UME","median values","measure","Upper Midwest West","North Carolina","North American swine industry","Swine Health Monitoring Project","temporal patterns","monitoring of interventions","system levels","primary objective","Wallis test","monitors","Minnesota","Iowa","sow herds","environmental features","Nebraska","respiratory syndrome","location of participants","known considerable economic losses","quantitative terms","overlap","implementation","overall endemic nature","spreader events","study","minimum","Variation","Oklahoma panhandle","production systems","Kruskal","pathogen\u2019s transmissibility","design","Results","areas","dataset"],"language":"en"},

A total of 17 metabolites were identified including the glucuronide arbidol and the glucuronide sulfinylarbidol as the major metabolites. Arbidol and its metabolites have some common fragmentation patterns as a result of a homolytic bond cleavage. This cleavage will form odd\u2010electron ions with the loss of a radical. The arbidol fragmentation sequence is first to lose dimethylamine (45 Da), followed by the loss of acetaldehyde (44 Da), and then the phenylthio radical (109 Da). This fragmentation sequence is also observed from N\u2010demethylarbidol, sulfonylarbidol, and N\u2010demethylsulfonylarbidol. However, for sulfinylarbidol and N\u2010demethylsulfinylarbidol, the fragmentation sequence is reversed so that the phenylsulfiny radical (125 Da) was lost first, followed by the loss of dimethylamine (45 Da), and then acetaldehyde (44 Da). The exact masses for arbidol and sulfinylarbidol fragment ions were determined by a quadrupole/time\u2010of\u2010flight mass spectrometer (Q\u2010TOF MS). The phase II metabolites, such as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of arbidol, N\u2010demethylarbidol, sulfonylarbidol, and N\u2010demethylsulfonylarbidol were identified by observing the neutral loss of 80 Da (SO(3)) or 176 Da (glucuronic acid) from the MS(2) spectra. The sulfate and glucuronide conjugates such as sulfinylarbidol and N\u2010demethylsulfinylarbidol had an unusual fragmentation pattern, in which the phenylsulfinyl radical (125 Da) was lost before the loss of SO(3) group (80 Da) or glucuronic acid (176 Da) occurred.

Increased CD8(\u002B) T cell frequency and function is associated with better prognosis in cancer patients. Interleukin 10 is a cytokine with controversial roles in CD8(\u002B) T cell\u2013mediated anti-tumor immunity. We therefore examined the interleukin 10 expression and consumption in CD8(\u002B) T cells harvested from the peripheral blood and resected tumors of gastric cancer patients of stages II\u2013IV. We found that the gastric cancer patients presented significantly elevated frequencies of interleukin 10\u2013expressing cells in both CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells compared to healthy controls. But distinctive from the interleukin 10\u2013expressing CD4(\u002B) T cells, which increased in frequency in advanced cancer, the interleukin 10\u2013expressing CD8(\u002B) T cells did not increase with cancer stage in the peripheral blood and actually decreased with cancer stage in resected tumor.

Despite this impressive economic development, this growth exists side by side with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crises and the persisting deficiencies in public health provision in China. Acknowledging the prevailing health problems, the Chinese government has encouraged the development of health non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to the health challenges and address the gaps in public health provision of the government. HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs have been perceived as the most outstanding civil society group developed in China. Considering the low priority of health policies since the economic reform, the limitation of the \u201Cthird sector\u201D activity permitted in authoritarian China, together with the political sensitivity of the HIV/AIDS problem in the country, this article aims to explain the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China with the usage of the securitization framework in the field of international relations (IR). METHODS: The research that underpins this article is based on a desk-based literature review as well as in-depth field interviews with individuals working in HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China. Face-to-face interviews for this research were conducted between January and May in 2011, and between December 2016 and January 2017, in China. Discourse analysis was in particular employed in the study of the security-threat framing process (securitization) of HIV/AIDS in China. RESULTS: This article argues that the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China is largely attributed to the normative and technical effects of HIV/AIDS securitization ushered in by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereinafter Global Fund) observed in China. Despite depicting a positive scenario, the development of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China generated by the international securitization efforts is largely limited. An internal and external factor was identified to verify the argument, namely (1) the reduction of international financial commitments, as well as (2) the fragmentation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community in China. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that international securitization weakened with the rise of Chinese commitment on HIV/AIDS interventions. In other words, HIV/AIDS-related responses delivered by the national government are no longer checked by the global mechanism of HIV/AIDS; thus it is unclear whether these NGOs would remain of interest as partners for the government. The fragmentation of the HIV/AIDS community would further hinder the development, preventing from NGOs with the same interest forming alliances to call for changes in current political environment. Such restriction on the concerted efforts of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China would make achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster stronger partnerships between the government and civil society difficult, which in turn hindering the realization of ending HIV/AIDS in the world by 2030.","publish_time":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo, Catherine Yuk-ping","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57a8f6955709acb05304154c9863ca79f6a5c1b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5956947.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0364-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","United Nations Security Council","Global Fund"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["AIDS securitization","development of HIV","AIDS-focused NGOs","AIDS-related NGOs","AIDS community","AIDS problem","proliferation of HIV","AIDS interventions","fragmentation of HIV","AIDS-related responses","authoritarian China","global mechanism of HIV","concerted efforts of HIV","AIDS-focused NGO community","technical effects of HIV","article","international securitization efforts","health challenges","Chinese government","public health provision","securitization framework","impressive economic development","national government","development of health non-governmental organizations","prevailing health problems","Global Fund","field of international relations","Sustainable Development Goals","low priority of health policies","economic reform","unprecedented economic growth","research","reduction of international financial commitments","in-depth field interviews","civil society difficult","outstanding civil society group","political sensitivity","Face-to-face interviews","immune deficiency syndrome","rise of Chinese commitment","current political environment","severe acute respiratory syndrome","security-threat framing process","United Nations Security Council","desk-based literature review","SARS","crises","persisting deficiencies","achievement","study","SDGs","UNSC","stronger partnerships","turn","gaps","Tuberculosis","human immunodeficiency virus","individuals","usage","changes","sector","Malaria","country","Discourse analysis","limitation","alliances","activity","restriction","BACKGROUND","positive scenario","realization","words","external factor","CONCLUSIONS","world","argument","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for children. The top principles guiding participants\u2019 allocative decisions were treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access.

This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Prospective crossover physiologic study. SETTING: ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H(2)O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial co(2) increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53\u20131.08]; range, 0.16\u20131.40). The Fio(2) needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32\u201345%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait. These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mauri, Tommaso; Spinelli, Elena; Scotti, Eleonora; Colussi, Giulia; Basile, Maria Cristina; Crotti, Stefania; Tubiolo, Daniela; Tagliabue, Paola; Zanella, Alberto; Grasselli, Giacomo; Pesenti, Antonio","journal":"Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb6cccb6f7df092aad8268460b65b5d4bc8cb43b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188034.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory distress syndrome patients","respiratory mechanics","lung recruitment","lower positive end-expiratory pressure","higher positive end-expiratory pressure","positive end-expiratory pressure level","specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome","care of patients","intubated patients","paralyzed patients","two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial","confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease","ventilation inhomogeneity","unchanged respiratory rate","potential","Severe cases of coronavirus disease","ventilation-perfusion mismatch","lung units","inflation ratio","low driving pressure","large variability","electrical impedance tomography","median value higher","ICU","selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings","specific pathophysiological trait","viable oxygenation","arterial blood gases","ventilated nonperfused units","Prospective crossover physiologic study","larger proportion","northern Italy","university-affiliated hospital","dead space fraction","admission","perfused nonventilated ones","DESIGN","compliance","tidal volume","MAIN RESULTS","findings","CONCLUSIONS","random order","MEASUREMENTS","INTERVENTIONS","subgroup","range","Fio"],"language":"en"},

Culling-induced social perturbation of badger populations may lead to unexpected outcomes. We test predictions from the \u2018perturbation hypothesis\u2019, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government\u0027s Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34\u201343% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riordan, Philip; Delahay, Richard John; Cheeseman, Chris; Johnson, Paul James; Macdonald, David Whyte","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c405097039f3cfefa4c6cf436925d3e3c8c3e013.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3237560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22194946/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028904","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","UK Government\u0027s Randomised Badger","RBCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Neighbouring social groups","Neighbouring groups","targeted social groups","removed groups","badger social groups neighbouring removals","social perturbation of badger populations","impact of culling operations","social stress","social disruption","Increased bTB prevalence","European badger","surviving badgers","UK Government\u0027s Randomised Badger Culling Trial","movement of surviving individuals","epidemiology of bTB","emergence of bTB","frequency of individual badger movements","moving individuals","surviving population","response","movement rate of individuals","summer ranges of individuals","individual adult badgers","Meles meles","study areas","treatment population","disease transmission","perturbation hypothesis","direct contact","expression of disease","direct evidence","Home range areas of animals","cattle","data","RBCT","influence","radio-collars","wildlife host","incidence of bovine tuberculosis","immunosuppression","locational fixes","unexpected outcomes","cubs","Significant increases","equivocal results","sites","predictions","setts","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

Besides GPI-linked alkaline phosphatase in Aedes aegypti mosquito-larval midguts, membrane-bound aminopeptidase N (AaeAPN) is widely thought to serve as a Cry4Ba receptor. Here, two full-length AaeAPN isoforms, AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783, predicted to be GPI-linked were cloned and successfully expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells as 112- and 107-kDa membrane-bound proteins, respectively. In the cytotoxicity assay, Sf9 cells expressing each of the two AaeAPN isoforms showed increased sensitivity to the Cry4Ba mosquito-active toxin. Double immunolocalization revealed specific binding of Cry4Ba to each individual AaeAPN expressed on the cell membrane surface. Sequence analysis and homology-based modeling placed these two AaeAPNs to the M1 aminopeptidase family as they showed similar four-domain structures, with the most conserved domain II being the catalytic component. Additionally, the most variable domain IV containing negatively charged surface patches observed only in dipteran APNs could be involved in insect specificity. Overall results demonstrated that these two membrane-bound APN isoforms were responsible for mediating Cry4Ba toxicity against AaeAPN-expressed Sf9 cells, suggesting their important role as functional receptors for the toxin counterpart in A. aegypti mosquito larvae.","publish_time":"2015-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aroonkesorn, Aratee; Pootanakit, Kusol; Katzenmeier, Gerd; Angsuthanasombat, Chanan","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abf7357ff5204fc96ea4a9d5a7447ce3456ff16e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124302.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X15006920; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X15006920; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25871797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sf9 cells","individual AaeAPN","full-length AaeAPN isoforms","membrane-bound APN isoforms","Cry4Ba mosquito-active toxin","membrane-bound aminopeptidase N","Cry4Ba receptor","toxin specificity","aegypti mosquito larvae","cell membrane surface","kDa membrane-bound proteins","mediating Cry4Ba toxicity","specific binding of Cry4Ba","midgut cells of susceptible insect larvae","toxin counterpart","conserved domain","domain structures","insect specificity","GPI","variable domain IV","Aedes aegypti mosquito-larval midguts","functional receptors","surface patches","M1 aminopeptidase family","toxins","critical determinant","alkaline phosphatase","important role","increased sensitivity","AaeAPNs","AaeAPN2783","homology-based modeling","dipteran APNs","Sequence analysis","Bacillus thuringiensis","Double immunolocalization","AaeAPN2778","interaction","catalytic component","Spodoptera frugiperda","cytotoxicity assay","Overall results"],"language":"en"},

Three HCoV-related outbreaks were observed (February, August and December), associated with a high prevalence of HCoV infection in the staff. During the August outbreak, 50% to 78% of hospitalised neonates and children were infected. Seventy-five percent of hospitalised preterm neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks and 52.4% of staff members were infected. Risk factors for NRVI in neonates were birth weight, gestational age, ventilation, oxygenation and hospitalisation length. Ninety-two percent of infected preterm neonates were symptomatic, mainly with bradycardia and respiratory worsening. These data provide additional evidence for a possibly significant role of HCoV in NRVI in a PNICU. The role of staff or hospitalised children in spreading HCoV is hypothesised.","publish_time":"2008-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagneur, Arnaud; Vallet, Sophie; Talbot, Pierre J.; Legrand-Quillien, Marie-Christine; Picard, Bertrand; Payan, Christopher; Sizun, Jacques","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29ca5dbb801b00ca8def7597872575a869fe4e1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087120.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18335238/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-008-0687-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-related NRVI","HCoV detection","HCoV-related outbreaks","hospitalised neonates","significant role of HCoV","hospitalised children","year period of HCoV outbreaks","percent of hospitalised preterm neonates","high prevalence of HCoV infection","percent of infected preterm neonates","role of staff","prospective survey of NRVI","staff members","gestational age","PNICU","respiratory worsening","incidence","respiratory syncitial virus","monthly nasal samples","potential agent of nosocomial viral respiratory infections","ventilation","birth weight","neonatal intensive care unit","RSV","new molecular techniques","influenza viruses","oxygenation","immunofluorescence","paramyxoviruses","additional evidence","bradycardia","weeks","hospitalisation length","high-risk infants","Risk factors","study","Human coronavirus","admission","RT-PCR","data","adenoviruses"],"language":"en"},

The aim was to compare both modalities for detection of pulmonary infections and to explore performance of low-dose computed tomography for early detection of invasive fungal disease. The low-dose computed tomography remained blinded during the study. A consensus diagnosis of the fever episode made by an expert panel was used as reference standard. We included 67 consecutive patients on the first day of febrile neutropenia. According to the consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had pulmonary infections. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 36%, 93%, 50% and 88% for radiography, and 73%, 91%, 62% and 94% for low-dose computed tomography, respectively. An uncorrected McNemar showed no statistical difference (p = 0.197). Mean radiation dose for low-dose computed tomography was 0.24 mSv. Four out of 5 included patients diagnosed with invasive fungal disease had radiographic abnormalities suspect for invasive fungal disease on the low-dose computed tomography scan made on day 1 of fever, compared to none of the chest radiographs. We conclude that chest radiography has little value in the initial assessment of febrile neutropenia on day 1 for detection of pulmonary abnormalities. Low-dose computed tomography improves detection of pulmonary infiltrates and seems capable of detecting invasive fungal disease at a very early stage with a low radiation dose.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerritsen, M.

The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP1 and pPSP.FP2 containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.","publish_time":"1996-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sirinarumitr, Theerapol; Paul, Prem S.; Kluge, John P.; Halbur, Patrick G.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10d26e0d6a3d50bd821ebc7c1588cb48d88431ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0166093495019014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093495019014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","PRCV","TGEV RNA","ISH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV RNA","differentiation of TGEV","PRCV-infected pigs","S gene of TGEV","tissues of pigs","bronchial epithelial cells","bronchiolar epithelial cells","crypt epithelial cells","virus-inoculated cell cultures","ISH","RNA probes","pneumocytes","type","porcine respiratory coronavirus","respiratory coronavirus infections","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","mechanism of pathogenesis","diagnostic test","swine coronaviruses","detection","tissue sections","lungs","alveolar macrophages","better understanding","technique","potential applications","studies","intestines","enterocytes","situ hybridization","tips of villi","plasmids","procedure"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Retrospective study between January 2003 and April 2007 was carried out in the PICU. Every child with a laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infection was included. RESULTS: 54 viruses were identified in 49 children (27 M, 22 F) over a 52\u2010month period. The three respiratory virus species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 17), influenza (n = 13) and parainfluenza (n = 12), accounted for 86% of these 49 cases. PICU admissions due to influenza A (n = 10) were more common than influenza B (n = 3), whereas parainfluenza type 3 (n = 7) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. Comparing these three common viruses, the mean age of children admitted with RSV was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza (1.2 years vs. 5.6 years vs. 2.4 years, P = 0.003). Pre\u2010existing conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with RSV infection. These respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis, seizures, cardiac arrest, coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One patient with RSV and another with influenza A died during their PICU stay. Nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids, and 88% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Approximately one in five of them had nebulised adrenaline, airway endoscopies or bacterial co\u2010infections. Adenovirus was isolated in four patients and two (both with adenovirus type 3) died during the PICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: In PICU, respiratory viral infections were associated with significant morbidity and life\u2010threatening conditions.

Data sources We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. Results Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. Limitations The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. Conclusions Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. Implications of key findings Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Serge, Rozenberg; Vandromme, Jean; Charlotte, Martin","journal":"Maturitas","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28045d79e48f76847ef20e7f1f3c49bef51e7fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512220302668?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425315/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378512220302668; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.05.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["women","proportion of men","pandemic men","Data sources","complications of Covid","biological differences","studies","large heterogeneity","gender equality","publications","rates of co-morbidities","study evaluation","available databases","Implications of key findings Countries","long-term health issues","choice of treatments","future consequences","article","age","behavioral habits","terms of vaccination strategies","quantification synthesis","objectives","testing","reporting","Abstract Background","infections","Results","Conclusions","Limitations","account"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR. Between 2010 and 2013, 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries. They were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus (\u03B1CoV) and beta-CoV (\u03B2CoV), respectively. The \u03B2CoVs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) (n = 55) clustered with other bat \u03B2CoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of \u03B2CoVs which also includes the MERS-CoV. \u03B1CoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat \u03B1CoV sequences previously published. A closely related strain of PEDV, responsible for severe diarrhea in pigs (PEDV-CoV), was detected in 2 Myotis bats.

During this time, consumption of all antimicrobials for systemic use decreased by 33%. This change was driven by a 44% decrease in the consumption of unrestricted antibacterials, which was offset by a 42% increase in the consumption of restricted agents. The trends in MRSA prevalence (number of isolates/1000 patient-days) and HA-MRSA incidence (number of HA-MRSA-infected persons/1000 patient-days) correlated with the trend in overall consumption of antimicrobials. Significant positive correlations were observed between MRSA prevalence and the consumption of extended-spectrum and \u03B2-lactamase-resistant penicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among children aged younger than 5 years hospitalized with febrile ARI at two national hospitals in Niamey between January and December 2015. Clinical presentation and procedures during admission were documented using a standardized case investigation form. Nasopharyngeal specimens collected from each patient were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses and bacteria using the Fast Track Diagnostic 21 Plus kit. RESULTS: We enrolled and tested 638 children aged younger than 5 years, of whom 411 (64.4%) were aged younger than 1 year, and 15 (2.4%) died during the study period. Overall, 496/638 (77.7%) specimens tested positive for at least one respiratory virus or bacterium; of these, 195 (39.3%) tested positive for respiratory viruses, 126 (25.4%) tested positive for respiratory bacteria, and 175 (35.3%) tested positive for both respiratory viruses and bacteria. The predominant viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (149/638; 23.3%), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1 to 4 (78/638; 12.2%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (62/638; 9.4%), human adenovirus (HAV) (60/638; 9.4%), and influenza virus (INF) (52/638; 8.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (249/638; 39.0%) was the most frequently detected bacterium, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (112/638; 12.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae type B (16/638; 2.5%). Chest X\u2010rays were performed at the discretion of the attending physician on 301 (47.2%) case patients. Of these patients, 231 (76.7%) had abnormal radiological findings. A total of 135/638 (21.2%) and 572/638 (89.7%) children received antibiotic treatment prior to admission and during admission, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of respiratory viruses was detected among children aged younger than 5 years with febrile ARI, raising concerns about excessive use of antibiotics in Niger.","publish_time":"2019-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lagare, Adamou; Ousmane, Sani; Dano, Ibrahim Dan; Issaka, Bassira; Issa, Idi; Mainassara, Halima Boubacar; Testa, Jean; Tempia, Stefano; Mamadou, Saidou","journal":"Health Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bad0e9f737316570c33138d5cc95cc233cd937ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6869554.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768420/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.137","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fast Track Diagnostic"],"locations":["Niamey"],"keyphrases":["children","respiratory bacteria","years","panel of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","high proportion of respiratory viruses","acute respiratory infections","febrile ARI","admission","predominant viruses","human parainfluenza virus","etiology of ARI","detected bacterium","Niamey","prospective study","human rhinovirus","human adenovirus","study period","AIMS","case patients","reported clinical procedures","national hospitals","bacterial infections","Clinical presentation","Nasopharyngeal specimens","standardized case investigation form","Niger\u0027s capital city","concerns","excessive use of antibiotics","Fast Track Diagnostic","ARIs","discretion","HPIV","types","common cause of death","antibiotic treatment","Haemophilus influenzae type B","kit","Staphylococcus aureus","CONCLUSION","RSV","abnormal radiological findings","Chest X\u2010rays","attending physician","HRV","HAV","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Streptococcus pneumoniae","country","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

In humans with community\u2010acquired pneumonia, APPs also have great utility as follow\u2010up markers aiding in the assessment of treatment response. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the applicability of APPs as markers of treatment response in dogs with BP. ANIMALS: Nineteen dogs diagnosed with BP and 64 healthy dogs. METHODS: The study was conducted as a prospective longitudinal observational study. Serum CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobin concentrations were followed during a natural course of BP. Normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment (treatment was stopped 5\u20137 days after CRP normalized) in 8 of 17 dogs surviving to discharge; 9 of 17 dogs were treated according to conventional recommendations. RESULTS: All measured APPs initially were significantly increased, but the magnitude of increase was not correlated to disease severity. C\u2010reactive protein and SAA concentrations decreased rapidly after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. When normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, treatment duration was significantly (P = .015) decreased without increasing the number of relapses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Serum CRP and SAA reflected the recovery process well and therefore may be used as markers of treatment response. According to the results, the normalization of serum CRP may be used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment in dogs with BP.","publish_time":"2016-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viitanen, S.J.; Lappalainen, A.K.; Christensen, M.B.; Sankari, S.; Rajam\u00E4ki, M.M.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/760fa9225c5f571c77674f53a1f2d9648eb2adb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5259651.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28032360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BP","SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment duration","Normalization of serum CRP","markers of treatment response","duration of antibiotic treatment","assessment of treatment response","serum amyloid","healthy dogs","initiation of antimicrobial treatment","SAA concentrations","follow\u2010up markers","applicability of APPs","measured APPs","sensitive markers of inflammation","reactive protein","BP","RESULTS","bacterial pneumonia","haptoglobin concentrations","prospective longitudinal observational study","phase proteins","great utility","natural course of","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","ANIMALS","useful diagnostic marker","CONCLUSIONS","recovery process","BACKGROUND","community","magnitude of increase","disease severity","humans","OBJECTIVES","aim","conventional recommendations","days","number of relapses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Vaginal lactobacilli and lactoferrin represent two essential actors in the vaginal environment. Lactobacilli represent the dominant bacterial species able to prevent facultative and obligate anaerobes outnumber in vaginal microbiota maintaining healthy microbial homeostasis. Several mechanisms underlie the protection exerted by lactobacilli: competition for nutrients and tissue adherence, reduction of the vaginal pH, modulation of immunity, and production of bioactive compounds. Among bioactive factors of cervicovaginal mucosa, lactoferrin, an iron-binding cationic glycoprotein, is a multifunctional glycoprotein with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic activities, recently emerging as an important modulator of inflammation. Lactobacilli and lactoferrin are largely under the influence of female hormones and of paracrine production of various cytokines. Lactoferrin is strongly increased in lower genital tract mucosal fluid of women affected by Neisseria gonorrheae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaginal dysbiosis characterized by low amounts of vaginal lactobacilli and increased levels of endogenous anaerobic bacteria, the increase in lactoferrin could act as an immune modulator assuming the role normally played by the healthy microbiota in vaginal mucosa. Then lactoferrin and lactobacilli may be considered as biomarkers of altered microbial homeostasis at vaginal level. Considering the shortage of effective treatments to counteract recurrent and/or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, the intravaginal administration of lactobacilli and lactoferrin could be a novel efficient therapeutic strategy and a valuable tool to restore mucosal immune homeostasis.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valenti, Piera; Rosa, Luigi; Capobianco, Daniela; Lepanto, Maria Stefania; Schiavi, Elisa; Cutone, Antimo; Paesano, Rosalba; Mastromarino, Paola","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5535ddf603f7b3b78897553296917cad0c0a789.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5837981.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29545798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lactobacilli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lactoferrin","healthy vaginal microbiota","vaginal pH","vaginal level","vaginal dysbiosis","vaginal environment","low amounts of vaginal lactobacilli","healthy microbiota","mucosal immune homeostasis","intravaginal administration of lactobacilli","healthy microbial homeostasis","immune modulator","female mucosal genital tract","biomarkers of altered microbial homeostasis","lower genital tract mucosal fluid of women","production of bioactive compounds","adaptive immune responses","antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections","multifunctional glycoprotein","cationic glycoprotein","various proteins","paracrine production of various cytokines","bioactive factors of cervicovaginal mucosa","Trichomonas vaginalis infections","innate defense system","influence of female hormones","important modulator of inflammation","dominant bacterial species able","increased levels of endogenous anaerobic bacteria","valuable tool","Chlamydia trachomatis","complex interaction","Neisseria gonorrheae","antifungal","reduction","tissue adherence","obligate anaerobes","different cells","novel efficient therapeutic strategy","modulation of immunity","essential actors","antiviral","competition","nutrients","role","antiparasitic activities","shortage of effective treatments","host","protection","pathogens","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, it can influence family dynamics and function in other ways, and unfortunately, it can also be associated with mortality, particularly in the inner-city environments of the United States. Thus understanding factors that lead to its development in early life is essential in developing strategies aimed at primary prevention. Two risk factors that have been identified by a number of investigators include the development of allergic sensitization and wheezing respiratory tract illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria, either alone or in combination. Both of these factors appear to exert their influences within the first few years of life, such that asthma becomes established before the child enters grade school at age 5 to 6 years. Therefore, because both allergic sensitization and viral and bacterial illnesses can occur in children who do not have asthma, it is paramount to identify genetic and environmental factors that activate, interact with, and/or direct the immune system and components of the respiratory tract along pathways that allow asthma to become established and expressed clinically.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Daniel J.; Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/110e5fead0fb19bf04382d05786c50a878274af7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4782609.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947979/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674916001068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674916001068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["asthma","grade school","environmental factors","risk factors","grade-school children","respiratory tract illnesses","development of allergic sensitization","years of life","greatest number of school days","bacterial illnesses","early life","number of investigators","developing strategies","components","accounts","pathways","inner-city environments","viruses","age","chronic diseases","primary prevention","immune system","family dynamics","function","United States","mortality","influences","combination"],"language":"en"},

Host inosine-5\u2019- monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) involved in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is known to be a potential target to inhibit the replication of viruses. Herein, we evaluated antiviral activity of a benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30, which was designed to inhibit IMPDH. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that N30 inhibited the replication of H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, including oseltamivir and amantadine resistant strains in vitro. Mechanistically, neuraminidase inhibition assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay suggested that N30 did not directly target the two envelope glycoproteins required for viral adsorption or release. Instead, the compound could depress the activity of IMPDH type II. Based on these findings, we further confirmed that N30 provided a strong inhibition on the replication of respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and a diverse strains of coxsackie B virus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the small molecule N30, as an inhibitor of IMPDH, might be a potential candidate to inhibit the replication of various viruses.","publish_time":"2017-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Jin; Ma, Linlin; Wang, Huiqiang; Yan, Haiyan; Zhang, Dajun; Li, Zhuorong; Jiang, Jiandong; Li, Yuhuan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d89d3273a8590afe87b37195d47f7e0c00d777c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5353780.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0724-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IMPDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of viruses","replication of various viruses","replication of H1N1","Influenza virus","inhibitor of IMPDH","influenza B viruses","small molecule N30","activity of IMPDH type","replication of respiratory syncytial virus","hemagglutination inhibition assay","neuraminidase inhibition assay","strong inhibition","RESULTS","potential target","benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30","diverse strains of coxsackie B virus","antiviral activity","potential candidate","amantadine resistant strains","huge threat","enterovirus","coronavirus","oseltamivir","H3N2","viral adsorption","world-wide public health","envelope glycoproteins","monophosphate dehydrogenase","release","Host inosine","synthesis of guanine nucleotides","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUD","compound","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, few strategies have explicitly utilized the weekend effect, which has been widely reported to be capable of reducing influenza infections. This study aims to explore six weekend-extension strategies against seasonal and pandemic flu outbreaks. METHODS: The weekend-extension strategies were designed to extend regular two-day weekend by one, two and three days, respectively, and in combination with either a continuous or discontinuous pattern. Their effectiveness was evaluated using an established agent-based spatially explicit simulation model in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, US. RESULTS: If the extensions last more than two days, the weekend-extension strategies can remarkably reduce the overall disease attack rate of seasonal flu. Particularly, a three-day continuous extension is sufficient to suppress the epidemic and confine the spread of disease. For the pandemic flu, the weekend-extension strategies only produce a few mitigation effects until the extensions exceed three days. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a compliance level above 75% is necessary for the weekend-extension strategies to take effects. CONCLUSION: This research is the first attempt to incorporate the weekend effect into influenza mitigation strategies. The results suggest that appropriate extensions of the regular two-day weekend can be a potential measure to fight against influenza outbreaks, while minimizing interruptions on normal rhythms of socio-economy. The concept of weekend extension would be particularly useful if there were a lack of vaccine stockpiles, e.g., in countries with limited health resources, or in the case of unknown emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Liang","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9006d571ae04afb914b4bdd5c32f2090d409b4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3146865.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weekend-extension strategies","concept of weekend extension","weekend effect","influenza mitigation strategies","regular two-day weekend","Non-pharmaceutical strategies","three-day continuous extension","influenza outbreaks","days","influenza infections","pandemic flu outbreaks","curtailing impacts of influenza","mitigation effects","appropriate extensions","RESULTS","overall disease attack rate of seasonal flu","spread of disease","public health","limited health resources","urbanized area of Buffalo","explicit simulation model","potential measure","countries","interruptions","established agent","case of unknown emerging infectious diseases","normal rhythms of socio","compliance level","NY","BACKGROUND","epidemic","lack of vaccine stockpiles","Sensitivity analysis","economy","combination","attempt","METHODS","discontinuous pattern","research","effectiveness","CONCLUSION","study"],"language":"en"},

Conversely, some reports of previous epidemics describe NIV as a very efficient and safe modality of respiratory support, if strict infection control measures are implemented. We discuss NIV use during epidemics and indicate the need for prospective randomized clinical studies on the efficacy of NIV in epidemic conditions to provide important information to the current body of literature.

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Materials and methods We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Results There were 9280 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veneto on April 1, 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 Million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40). Conclusion Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients. However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montopoli, M.; Zumerle, S.; Vettor, R.; Rugge, M.; Zorzi, M.; Catapano, C.

METHODS: We randomized 600 students into 4 treatment arms: 1) vitamin D(3) and gargling, 2) placebo and gargling, 3) vitamin D(3) and no gargling, and 4) placebo and no gargling. Students completed weekly electronic surveys and submitted self-collected mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs during September and October in 2010 or 2011. Symptomatic students also completed an electronic symptom diary. The primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of symptomatic clinical URTI and laboratory confirmed URTI respectively. RESULTS: Of 600 participants, 471 (78.5%) completed all surveys while 43 (7.2%) completed none; 150 (25.0%) reported clinical URTI. Seventy participants (23.3%) randomized to vitamin D(3) reported clinical URTI compared to 80 (26.7%) randomized to placebo (RR:0.79, CI(95):0.61-1.03, p = 0.09). Eighty-five participants (28.3%) randomized to gargling reported clinical URTI compared to 65 participants (21.7%) randomized to the no gargling arm (RR:1.3, CI(95):0.92-1.57, p = 0.19). Laboratory testing identified 70 infections (46.7 per 100 URTIs). Vitamin D(3) treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk for laboratory confirmed URTI (RR: 0.54, CI(95):0.34-0.84, p = 0.007) and with a significantly lower mean viral load measured as log(10) viral copies/mL (mean difference: -0.89, CI(95:) -1.7, -0.06, p = 0.04). Fewer students assigned to gargling experienced laboratory confirmed URTI, however this was not statistically significant (RR:0.82, CI(95):0.53-1.26, p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vitamin D(3) is a promising intervention for the prevention of URTI. Vitamin D(3) significantly reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed URTI and may reduce the risk of clinical infections.

Understanding public perception and behavior toward influenza pandemics is important for minimizing the effects of such events. Public perception and behavior are expected to change over the course of an influenza pandemic, but this idea has received little attention in previous studies. Our study aimed to understand the dynamics of public perception and behavior over the course of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Three consecutive cross-sectional surveys were administered among Beijing residents with random-digit dialing techniques in March 2008 and August and November 2009. Effective samples of 507, 508 and 1006 respondents were interviewed in each of the three surveys, respectively. The mean scores of risk perception were low to moderate across the three surveys. The perceived risk of infection of self was significantly lower than that of the community, revealing an optimistic bias. Longitudinally, the perceived risk of contracting H1N1 increased, whereas the perceived risk of being unable to obtain medicine and medical care once influenza permeated the community first increased and then decreased. Responsive actions toward influenza varied. Most respondents took actions that required little extra effort, such as ventilating rooms; these actions did not change over time. Comparatively, a smaller number of respondents took actions for coping with influenza, such as vaccination; however, these actions were taken by an increasing number of respondents over time. The association between risk perception and behavior was unstable. Positive, insignificant, and negative associations were obtained in the three surveys. In conclusion, the evolving patterns of risk perception and responsive behavior over the course of an influenza pandemic are sensitive to how risk and behavior are defined and scoped.","publish_time":"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Jianhua; Peng, Zongchao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51f8792fd26cd2c094c1b2d0e5539902fb6221da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4682843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658371/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["Influenza pandemics","H1N1 influenza pandemic","responsive behavior","evolving patterns of risk perception","mean scores of risk perception","perceived risk of infection","Responsive actions","dynamics of public perception","perceived risk of contracting H1N1","course","increasing number of respondents","smaller number of respondents","community","consecutive cross-sectional surveys","time","little attention","little extra effort","Beijing residents","medical care","idea","medicine","ventilating rooms","random-digit","human health","self","negative associations","previous studies","techniques","effects","conclusion","society","optimistic bias","Effective samples","vaccination","events","study"],"language":"en"},

Although the mechanisms of action of chloroquine clearly indicate that it might inhibit filoviral infections, several clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in the treatment of other acute viral infections \u2013 including dengue and influenza A and B \u2013 caused by low pH\u2010dependent viruses, have reported that chloroquine had no clinical efficacy, and these results demoted chloroquine from the potential treatments for other virus families requiring low pH for infectivity. The present review is aimed at investigating whether chloroquine could combat the present Ebola virus epidemic, and also at exploring the main reasons for the reported lack of efficacy. Literature was sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, reference list of articles and textbooks \u2013 Fields Virology (Volumes 1and 2), the cytokine handbook, Pharmacology in Medicine: Principles and Practice, and hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy. The present analysis concludes that (1) chloroquine might find a place in the treatment of Ebola, either as a monotherapy or in combination therapies; (2) the ineffectiveness of chloroquine, or its analogue, hydroxychloroquine, at treating infections from low pH\u2010dependent viruses is a result of the failure to attain and sustain a steady state concentration sufficient to increase and keep the pH of the acidic organelles to approximately neutral levels; (3) to successfully treat filoviral infections \u2013 or other viral infections that emerge or emerged from low pH\u2010dependent viruses \u2013 a steady state chloroquine plasma concentration of at least 1 \u00B5g/mL(~3.125 \u03BCM/L) or a whole blood concentration of 16 \u03BCM/L must be achieved and be sustained until the patients\u0027 viraemia becomes undetectable. These concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrations \u2013 although such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. The feasibility of the conclusion in the preceding texts has recently been supported by a subsequent study that shows that amodiaquine, a derivative of CQ, is able to protect humans infected with Ebola from death.","publish_time":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akpovwa, Hephzibah","journal":"Cell Biochem Funct","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28698e9d58d0b455cfa1adb28be25bc7f9286859.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0c02e8ec33a4d59a3787121043e343975a772eb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5071688.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ineffectiveness of chloroquine","chloroquine retinopathy","low pH","acidic pH","steady state chloroquine plasma concentration","dependent viruses","filoviral infections","steady state concentrations","acute viral infections","virus families","steady state concentration sufficient","present Ebola virus epidemic","treatment of Ebola","clinical efficacy","hydroxychloroquine","blood concentration","reported lack of efficacy","present review","present analysis","\u03BCM","acidic organelles","clinical trials","reference list of articles","Scopus","textbooks","Google Scholar","Practice","potential treatments","Pharmacology","Medicine","Principles","dengue","results","Fields Virology","amodiaquine","PubMed","humans","influenza","successful infection","\u00B5g","analogue","infectivity","severe adverse effects","derivative of CQ","cytokine handbook","main reasons","Filoviridae family","conclusion","toxicities","Volumes","neutral levels","monotherapy","failure","place","preceding texts","combination therapies","patients\u0027 viraemia","actions","feasibility","subsequent study","Literature","death","aminoquinolines","mechanisms of action"],"language":"en"},

It contains two heptad repeat regions, denoted HRN and HRC. We have identified the location of the two interacting HR regions that form the six-helix bundle (B. Tripet, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 279: 20836\u201320849, 2004). In this study, HRC peptide (1150\u20131185) was chosen as the region to make structure-based substitutions to design a series of HRC analogs with increased hydrophobicity, helical propensity and electrostatic interactions, or with a covalent constraint (lactam bridge) to stabilize the \u03B1-helical conformation. Effects of the substitutions on \u03B1-helical structure of HRC peptides and their abilities to interact with HRN or HRC have been examined by biophysical techniques. Our results show that the binding of the HRC analogs to HRN does not correlate with the coiled-coil stability of the HRC analogs, but their interactions with HRC does correlate with their stability, except for HRC7. This study also suggested three types of potential peptide inhibitors against viral entry can be designed, those that simultaneously inhibit interaction with HRC and HRN and those that are either HRC-specific or HRN-specific. For example, our study shows the important role of \u03B1-helical structure in the formation of the six-helix bundle where the lactam bridge constrained analog (HRC5) provided the best interaction with HRN. The importance of \u03B1-helical structure in the interaction with native HRC was demonstrated with analog HRC4 which binds best to HRC.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Zhe; Tripet, Brian; Hodges, Robert S.","journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2e8bd3ae292b1d70c6897f3594bdbb4bca3a0b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129827.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847706001183; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847706001183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no \u201Cuniversal\u201D viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the \u201Ccommon viral ancestor\u201D to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez, Virginia; Lagares, Alfredo; Arteaga, Heiser; Mattar, Salim; Ruiz, Luis Carlos","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94af6768b72fcbad1a5d2ff7e43b36a9c8f3af6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149897.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012819400300003X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012819400300003X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral evolution","survival of viruses","coevolution of viruses","coexistence of viruses","host cells","viral ancestors","viral genes","common viral ancestor","understanding of cell evolution","fundamental role","important role","way","special role","defense systems of hosts","Insects","infectious diseases","interaction of infectious agents","selective pressure","immunity","kind of arms race","product","molecular structures","history","hypotheses","ecological niche","hypothetical evolutionary model","pathogens","debate","environmental factors","emergence of emerging","intracellular development","coevolutionary scenario of colonization","cycle of virus replication","right","origin","war","chapter","deescalation","tree of life","aim","nature"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Active surveillance was completed on 47 households in rural coastal Kenya over 6 months during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were taken from 483 household members twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. Using molecular diagnostics, NPSs from 6 households were screened for 15 respiratory viruses and the remainder of households only for the most frequent viruses observed: rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV; comprising strains 229E, OC43, and NL63), adenovirus (AdV), and RSV (A and B). RESULTS: Of 16928 NPSs tested for the common viruses, 4259 (25.2%) were positive for \u22651 target; 596 (13.8%) had coinfections. Detection frequencies were 10.5% RV (1780), 7.5% HCoV (1274), 7.3% AdV (1232), and 3.2% RSV (537). On average, each household and individual had 6 and 3 different viruses detected over the study period, respectively. Rhinovirus and HCoV were detected in all the 47 households while AdV and RSV were detected in 45 (95.7%) and 40 (85.1%) households, respectively. The individual risk of infection over the 6-month period was 93.4%, 80.1%, 71.6%, 61.5%, and 37.1% for any virus, RV, HCoV, AdV, and RSV, respectively. NPSs collected during symptomatic days and from younger age groups had higher prevalence of virus detection relative to respective counterparts. RSV was underrepresented in households relative to hospital admission data. CONCLUSIONS: In this household setting, respiratory virus infections and associated illness are ubiquitous. Future studies should address the health and economic implications of these observations.","publish_time":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munywoki, Patrick K; Koech, Dorothy C; Agoti, Charles N; Cane, Patricia A; Medley, Graham F; Nokes, D James","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/356381d431c775e013710e6bff7ab89a507eb013.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668861/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","AdV"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["RSV","households relative","remainder of households","NPSs","HCoV","AdV","transmission of respiratory viruses","respiratory virus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","different viruses","frequent viruses","common viruses","higher prevalence of virus detection relative","household setting","household members","rhinovirus","Detection frequencies","study period","month period","individual risk of infection","younger age groups","high-intensity close-contact environments favorable","months","associated illness","health","strains","symptomatic days","human coronavirus","respective counterparts","rural coastal Kenya","OC43","NL63","hospital admission data","adenovirus","season","economic implications","observations","Active surveillance","BACKGROUND","molecular diagnostics","Future studies","METHODS","symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","Nasopharyngeal swabs","average","target","low-income settings","RESULTS","coinfections"],"language":"en"},

The disease is multifactorial, with either stress or reduced immunity allowing several pathogens to emerge. We investigated the susceptibility of bovine airway epithelial cells (BAEC) to infection by the three major viruses associated with the BRDC: bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3). For this purpose, two culture systems for well-differentiated BAEC were used: the air-liquid interface (ALI) system, where filter-grown BAEC differentiate into a pseudostratified respiratory epithelium and precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) where BAEC are maintained in the original tissue organisation. Comparative infection studies demonstrated that entry and release of BPIV3 occurred specifically via the apical membrane with ciliated cells being the major target cells. By contrast, airway epithelial cells were largely resistant to infection by BHV-1. When the epithelial barrier was abolished by opening tight junctions or by injuring the cell monolayer, BHV-1 infected mainly basal cells. Respiratory epithelial cells were also refractory to infection by BRSV. However, this virus infected neither differentiated epithelial cells nor basal cells when the integrity of the epithelial barrier was destroyed. In contrast to cells of the airway epithelium, subepithelial cells were susceptible to infection by BRSV. Altogether, these results indicate that the three viruses of the same disease complex follow different strategies to interact with the airway epithelium.

Continuous measurements were conducted between April and June 2014 at a site located 110 m from the main taxiway and 300 m from the runway. Results revealed no significantly elevated levels of BC and PNC, but exhibited characteristic diurnal profiles. PNSD were then analysed using both k-means cluster analysis and positive matrix factorization. Five clusters were extracted and identified as midday nucleation events, road traffic, aircraft, airport and nighttime pollution. Six factors were apportioned and identified as probable sources according to the size profiles, directional association, diurnal variation, road and airport traffic volumes and their relationships to micrometeorology and common air pollutants. Photochemical nucleation accounted for \u223C44% of total number, followed by road \u002B shipping traffic (26%).

The remaining factors accounted for less than 10% of number counts, but were relevant for total volume concentrations: nighttime nitrate, regional pollution and local resuspension. An analysis of BC levels over different wind sectors revealed no especially significant contributions from specific directions associated with the main local sources, but a potentially significant role of diurnal dynamics of the mixing layer on BC levels. The approaches adopted in this study have identified and apportioned the main sources of particles and BC at an international airport located in area affected by a complex emission scenario. The results may underpin measures for improving local and regional air quality, and health impact assessment studies.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masiol, Mauro; Vu, Tuan V.; Beddows, David C.S.; Harrison, Roy M.","journal":"Atmospheric Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4f161d881e70d1547a251da060b4b75b0e66f32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288548/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231016303594; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231016303594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PNC","SMPS"],"locations":["Venice"],"keyphrases":["total number","main local sources","main sources of particles","total PNC","analysis of BC levels","significant sources of particles","road traffic","total particle number concentrations","airport traffic volumes","elevated levels of BC","Airport of Venice","international airport","main mode","nm","number counts","probable sources","main taxiway","total volume concentrations","Airport-related emissions","particle number size distributions","diurnal variation","regional pollution","significant role of diurnal dynamics","size profiles","nighttime pollution","significant contributions","characteristic diurnal profiles","local resuspension","shipping traffic","PNSD","Results","study","regional air quality","Abstract Atmospheric particles","nighttime nitrate","large airports","large range","cluster analysis","Photochemical nucleation","remaining factors","common air pollutants","midday nucleation events","relationships","aircraft","different wind sectors","high concern","micrometeorology","directional association","black carbon","mixing layer","specific directions","health impact assessment studies","toxic properties","effects","climate","area","Italy","positive matrix factorization","measures","complex emission scenario","lower limit","SMPS","\u03BCm","Continuous measurements","runway","clusters","approaches","site"],"language":"en"},

Fifty years ago, following the wide-scale manufacture and use of antibiotics and vaccines, it seemed that the battle against infections was being won for the human population. Since then, however, and in addition to increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, there has been an increase in the emergence of, mostly viral, zoonotic diseases from wildlife, sometimes causing fatal outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens. Almost two decades later, the situation has not changed and, despite improved knowledge of the underlying causes, little has been done at the policy level to address these threats. For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence.

Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin is effective at reducing the rates of coronary aneurysms. However, the role of B cells and antibodies in KD pathogenesis remains unclear. Murine models are not clear on the role for B cells and antibodies in pathogenesis. Studies on rare aneurysm specimens reveal plasma cell infiltrates. Antibodies generated from these aneurysmal plasma cell infiltrates showed cross-reaction to intracellular inclusions in the bronchial epithelium of a number of pathologic specimens from children with KD. These antibodies have not defined an etiology. Notably, a number of autoantibody responses have been reported in children with KD. Recent studies show acute B cell responses are similar in children with KD compared to children with infections, lending further support of an infectious disease cause of KD.

In this study, we investigated the presence of PDCoV in 49 faecal/intestinal samples from piglets with diarrhoea on different farms in Hebei province. Five samples (10.2%) were positive for PDCoV, but no coinfection of PDCoV with other enteropathogens was observed. A PDCoV strain named HB\u2010BD was successfully isolated from the intestinal contents of a diarrhoeic piglet and serially propagated in swine testicular (ST) cells for \u003E40 passages. The complete genome of the HB\u2010BD strain was sequenced and analysed. Genomic analysis showed that the HB\u2010BD strain had a closer relationship with Chinese strains than those from other countries and was grouped within the Chinese PDCoV cluster. The results of this study will be valuable for further research of PDCoV genetic evolution and development of effective diagnostic reagents, assays and potential vaccines against newly emerged PDCoV strains.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, B.\u2010J.; Zuo, Y.\u2010Z.; Gu, W.\u2010Y.; Luo, S.\u2010X.; Shi, Q.\u2010K.; Hou, L.\u2010S.; Zhong, F.; Fan, J.\u2010H.","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c6efff9a3cd78c88a6acea51d07f8dc7c27207.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29363288/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hebei"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of PDCoV","presence of PDCoV","coinfection of PDCoV","Chinese PDCoV isolates","Chinese PDCoV cluster","emerged PDCoV strains","research of PDCoV genetic evolution","HB","BD strain","Chinese strains","diarrhoea","intestinal samples","study","neonatal piglets","intestinal contents","genus Deltacoronavirus","Porcine deltacoronavirus","development of effective diagnostic reagents","potential vaccines","assays","little published information","enteric disease","different farms","closer relationship","dehydration","China","swine testicular","diarrhoeic piglet","clinical signs","cells","Hebei province","mortality","complete genome","countries","Genomic analysis","passages","results","evidence"],"language":"en"},

It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P \u2264 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P \u2264 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P \u003C 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kroll, F.S.A.; Putarov, T.

Here, the generation and characterization of the first selectable, SARS\u2013coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV)-based replicon cell line which can be used for screening is described. Partial SARS\u2013CoV cDNAs and antibiotic resistance/reporter gene DNA were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the replicon transcription template, which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the replicon RNA. The latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the transfected cells were selected for by antibiotic application. For the antibiotic-resistant cell lines thus generated, the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The suitability of this replicon cell line in drug screening was demonstrated by testing the inhibitory effect of several existing drugs and the results demonstrate that the SARS\u2013CoV replicon cell lines provide a safe tool for the identification of SARS\u2013CoV replicase inhibitors.

It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prada-Gracia, Diego; Huerta-Y\u00E9pez, Sara; Moreno-Vargas, Liliana M.","journal":"Bolet\u00EDn M\u00E9dico Del Hospital Infantil de M\u00E9xico (English Edition)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8dbe4f3b54bb15d1af2e0953697a91648b1b36c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2444340917001145; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444340917001145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel drug","drug candidates","drug discovery programs","field of anticancer drug design","silico drug design","conventional drug discovery process","novel anticancer drugs","discovery efforts","potential anticancer drugs","computational methodologies","computational approaches","years","novel technologies","arrival of new approaches","case studies","concept of rational design presenting","field of cancer","new medicine ready","crucial component","successful achievements","complex","aid","research advances","techniques","ligand","structure","fruitful insights","market","major impact","time-consuming venture","optimization","representative examples of molecules","virtual screening","Key principles","efficiency","identification","Abstract","scenario","paper","USD"],"language":"en"},

Most of the literature showed that the elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 are of little clinical significance. Lower albumin level is seen in severe COVID-19 and is not parallel to the changes in ALT and AST levels. We aimed to explore the impact of hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. The relationship between hypoalbuminemia and death was studied using binary logistic analysis. RESULTS A total of 299 adult patients were included, 160 (53.5%) were males and the average age was 53.4 \u00B1 16.7 years. The median time from the onset of illness to admission was 3 days (interquartile ranges 2-5). Approximately one-third of patients had comorbidities. Hypoalbuminemia (\u003C35g/L) was found in 106 (35.5%) patients. The difference in albumin was considerable between survivors and non-survivors (37.6 \u00B1 6.2 vs. 30.5 \u00B1 4.0, P \u003C 0.001). Serum albumin level was inversely correlated to white blood cell (r = -0.149, P = 0.01) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (r = -0.298, P \u003C0.001). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of comorbidities (OR = 6.816, 95%CI: 1.361-34.133), lymphopenia (OR = 13.130, 95%CI: 1.632-105.658) and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 6.394, 95%CI: 1.315-31.092) were independent predictive factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS Hypoalbuminemia was associated with the outcome of COVID-19. The potential therapeutic value of albumin infusion in COVID-19 should be further explored at the earliest.

It is not clear whether Fc\u03B3R receptors play a role in human asthma and allergy. The aim of current study was to investigate whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Fc\u03B3R genes (FCGR) are associated with human asthma and allergy. METHODS: Functional SNPs of FCGR2A (Fc\u03B3RIIA-131His\u003EArg, rs1801274), FCGR2B (Fc\u03B3RIIB-187Ile\u003EThr, rs1050501), FCGR2C (Fc\u03B3RIIC-13Gln\u003EStop, rs10917661), FCGR3A (Fc\u03B3RIIIA-158Val\u003EPhe, rs396991), and FCGR3B variants (Fc\u03B3RIIIB NA1 and NA2) were genotyped in an asthma family cohort including 370 atopy positive, 239 atopy negative, and 169 asthma positive subjects. The genotype and phenotype data (asthma, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and atopy) of subjects were analyzed using family-based association tests (FBAT) and logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. RESULT: The Fc\u03B3RIIA-131His\u003EArg SNP is significantly associated with atopy in a family-based association test (P = 0.00287) and in a logistic regression analysis (P = 0.0269, OR 0.732, 95% CI: 0.555\u20130.965). The Fc\u03B3RIIA-131His (or rs1801274-A) allele capable of binding human IgG2 has a protective role against atopy. In addition, the rare Fc\u03B3RIIB-187Thr (or rs1050501-C) allele defective for the receptor-mediated inhibitory signals is a risk factor for atopy (P = 0.0031, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209\u20132.556) and IgE production (P\u003C0.001). However, variants of activating Fc\u03B3RIIIA (rs396991), and Fc\u03B3RIIIB (NA1 and NA2), and Fc\u03B3RIIC (rs10917661) are not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy (P\u003E0.05).

During late summer of 2011, a first cluster of reduced milk yield, fever, and diarrhoea was reported in the Netherlands. Congenital malformations appeared in March 2012 and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified, becoming one of the very few orthobunyaviruses distributed in Europe. At the start of both epizootics, little was known about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these viruses in the European context and most assumptions were extrapolated based on other related viruses and/or other regions of the World. Standardized and repeatable models potentially mimicking clinical signs observed in the field are required to study the pathogenesis of these infections, and to clarify their ability to cross the placental barrier.

Apoptotic cell recognition and removal from the lung is mediated predominantly by airway macrophages, though immature dendritic cells and non-professional phagocytes, such as epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells, can also display this function. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells from the airways is essential for successful resolution of inflammation and the return to lung homeostasis. Disruption of this process leads to secondary necrosis of accumulating apoptotic cells, release of necrotic cell debris and subsequent uncontrolled inflammatory activation of the innate immune system by the released \u2018damage associated molecular patterns\u2019 (DAMPS). To control the duration of the immune response and prevent autoimmune reactions, anti-inflammatory signalling cascades are initiated in the phagocyte upon apoptotic cell uptake, mediated by a range of receptors that recognise specific phospholipids or proteins externalised on, or secreted by, the apoptotic cell. However, prolonged activation of apoptotic cell recognition receptors, such as the family of receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl and MerTK (TAM), may delay or prevent inflammatory responses to subsequent infections. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism controlling apoptotic cell recognition and removal from the lung in homeostasis and during inflammation, the contribution of defective efferocytosis to chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cystic fibrosis, and implications of the signals triggered by apoptotic cells in the susceptibility to pulmonary microbial infections.","publish_time":"2016-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grabiec, Aleksander M.; Hussell, Tracy","journal":"Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d78837afeedbb3c9dfa91a675aa03d34ef5a4387.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4896990.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-016-0555-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoptotic cell uptake","Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells","structural cells","epithelial cells","mesenchymal cells","prolonged activation of apoptotic cell recognition receptors","secondary necrosis of accumulating apoptotic cells","lung homeostasis","chronic inflammatory lung diseases","immature dendritic cells","chronic inflammatory responses","subsequent uncontrolled inflammatory activation","release of necrotic cell debris","immune response","removal","subsequent infections","process","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","innate immune system","pulmonary microbial infections","accumulation of large quantities of immune","range of receptors","non-professional phagocytes","contribution of defective efferocytosis","successful resolution of inflammation","asthma","Axl","family of receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3","cystic fibrosis","damage","autoimmune reactions","airways","mechanism","MerTK","anti-inflammatory signalling cascades","implications","return","airway macrophages","understanding","susceptibility","molecular patterns\u2019","proteins","specific phospholipids","signals","recent advances","DAMPS","TAM","apoptosis","review","Disruption","duration","function"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance, thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy studies.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Molteni, Claudio G; Daleno, Cristina; Valzano, Antonia; Tagliabue, Claudia; Galeone, Carlotta; Milani, Gregorio; Fossali, Emilio; Marchisio, Paola; Principi, Nicola","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2873380.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-85; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20433729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal samples","children","parental collections","median values","efficiency of pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs","direct involvement of parents","negative predictive values","cycle threshold values","trained pediatrician","real-time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates","epidemiological surveys","standard deviation","signs","years","sensitivity","patient acceptance","vaccine efficacy studies","months","specificity","findings","infants","novel swab design","symptoms of respiratory disease","randomised sequence","vs","study","methods","Cohen\u0027s kappa","confidence interval","comparison"],"language":"en"},

We performed a systematic review on the impact of alerting citizens as first responders and to provide an overview of different strategies and technologies used. Methods We searched electronic databases up to October 2019. Eligible studies described systems to alert citizens first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through text messages or apps. We analysed the implementation and performance of these systems and their impact on patients\u2019 outcomes. Results We included 28 manuscripts describing 12 different systems. The first text message system was implemented in 2006 and the first app in 2010. First responders accepted to intervene in median (interquartile) 28.7% (27-29%) of alerts and reached the scene after 4.6 (4.4-5.5) minutes for performing CPR. First responders arrived before ambulance, started CPR and attached a defibrillator in 47% (34-58%), 24% (23-27%) and 9% (6-14%) of cases, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that first responders activation increased layperson-CPR rates (1463/2292 [63.8%] in the intervention group vs. 1094/1989 [55.0%] in the control group; OR=1.70; 95% CI, 1.11\u20132.60; p=0.01) and survival to hospital discharge or at 30 days (327/2273 [14.4%] vs. 184/1955 [9.4%]; OR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.24\u20131.84; p\u003C0.001).

Sequence similarity-based approaches are widely used for function prediction; however, they are often inadequate in the absence of similar sequences or when the sequence similarity among known protein sequences is statistically weak. This study aimed to develop an accurate prediction method for identifying protein function, irrespective of sequence and structural similarities. RESULTS: A highly accurate prediction method capable of identifying protein function, based solely on protein sequence properties, is described. This method analyses and identifies specific features of the protein sequence that are highly correlated with certain protein functions and determines the combination of protein sequence features that best characterises protein function. Thirty-three features that represent subtle differences in local regions and full regions of the protein sequences were introduced. On the basis of 484 features extracted solely from the protein sequence, models were built to predict the functions of 11 different proteins from a broad range of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. The accuracy of protein function prediction using random forests with feature selection ranged from 94.23% to 100%. The local sequence information was found to have a broad range of applicability in predicting protein function. CONCLUSION: We present an accurate prediction method using a machine-learning approach based solely on protein sequence properties. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose new PNPRD features representing global and/or local differences in sequences, based on positively and/or negatively charged residues, to assist in predicting protein function. In addition, we identified a compact and useful feature subset for predicting the function of various proteins. Our results indicate that sequence-based classifiers can provide good results among a broad range of proteins, that the proposed features are useful in predicting several functions, and that the combination of our and traditional features may support the creation of a discriminative feature set for specific protein functions.","publish_time":"2009-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Bum Ju; Shin, Moon Sun; Oh, Young Joon; Oh, Hae Seok; Ryu, Keun Ho","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41b92c19649c6e5cd6a4e883e7edf9a43589bcdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2731080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664241/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-7-27","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predicting protein function","protein sequence properties","combination of protein sequence features","unknown protein","accuracy of protein function prediction","specific protein functions","certain protein functions","known protein sequences","sequence-based classifiers","local sequence information","specific features","Sequence similarity-based approaches","function of various proteins","proposed features","traditional features","accurate prediction method capable","broad range of proteins","molecular functions","new PNPRD features","local regions","method analyses","local differences","broad range of applicability","broad range of cellular components","feature selection","useful feature subset","good results","different proteins","absence of similar sequences","discriminative feature set","subtle differences","random forests","machine-learning approach","paper","creation","essential goal","biological processes","bioinformatics","models","structural similarities","primary contribution","study","CONCLUSION","residues","addition","basis","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

A viral quasispecies is a group of abundant and diversified genetically related viruses found in a single carrier. Current mainstream assembly methods, such as Velvet and SOAPdenovo, were not originally intended for the assembly of such metagenomics data, and therefore demands for new methods to provide accurate and informative assembly results for metagenomic data. RESULTS: In this study, we present a hybrid method for assembling highly polymorphic data combining the partial de novo-reference assembly (PDR) strategy and the BLAST-based assembly pipeline (BBAP). The PDR strategy generates in situ reference sequences through de novo assembly of a randomly extracted partial data set which is subsequently used for the reference assembly for the full data set. BBAP employs a greedy algorithm to assemble polymorphic reads. We used 12 hepatitis B virus quasispecies NGS data sets from a previous study to assess and compare the performance of both PDR and BBAP. Analyses suggest the high polymorphism of a full metagenomic data set leads to fragmentized de novo assembly results, whereas the biased or limited representation of external reference sequences included fewer reads into the assembly with lower assembly accuracy and variation sensitivity. In comparison, the PDR generated in situ reference sequence incorporated more reads into the final PDR assembly of the full metagenomics data set along with greater accuracy and higher variation sensitivity. BBAP assembly results also suggest higher assembly efficiency and accuracy compared to other assembly methods. Additionally, BBAP assembly recovered HBV structural variants that were not observed amongst assembly results of other methods. Together, PDR/BBAP assembly results were significantly better than other compared methods. CONCLUSIONS: Both PDR and BBAP independently increased the assembly efficiency and accuracy of highly polymorphic data, and assembly performances were further improved when used together. BBAP also provides nucleotide frequency information. Together, PDR and BBAP provide powerful tools for metagenomic data studies.

Co\u2010trimoxazole remains the first\u2010line treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia will respond to ganciclovir or foscarnet in most cases. The clinical outcome of acute respiratory failure can also be successful with proper intensive care, when indicated.","publish_time":"2016-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maschmeyer, Georg; Donnelly, J.

Approximately 7 log(10) tissue culture infectious dose(50) (TCID(50)) of EBOV/Mak was exposed to DAL at ambient temperature. Each dilution tested reduced the infectious EBOV/Mak titer by ~5 log(10) within one min. Detectable virus was still present after an 0.5-min exposure, but each DAL dilution caused \u003E4 log(10) reduction within this time. Detection of virus below the limit of detection of the TCID(50) assay was assessed by inoculating flasks of Vero E6 cells with undiluted neutralized sample and evaluating the cultures for cytopathic effect after 14 days incubation. No infectious virus was detected with this non-quantitative method in samples subjected to DAL for 5 or 10 min, regardless of the dilution evaluated.

Inoculation of the neuroattenuated JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the CNS of susceptible mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis that evolves into a chronic demyelinating disease, modeling white matter pathology observed in the human demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: JHMV infection induced the rapid and sustained expression of transcripts specific for the ELR (\u002B) chemokine ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as their binding receptor CXCR2, which was enriched within the spinal cord during chronic infection. Inhibiting CXCR2 signaling with neutralizing antiserum significantly (p\u003C0.03) delayed clinical recovery. Moreover, CXCR2 neutralization was associated with an increase in the severity of demyelination that was independent of viral recrudescence or modulation of neuroinflammation. Rather, blocking CXCR2 was associated with increased numbers of apoptotic cells primarily within white matter tracts, suggesting that oligodendrocytes were affected. JHMV infection of enriched oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures revealed that apoptosis was associated with elevated expression of cleaved caspase 3 and muted Bcl-2 expression. Inclusion of CXCL1 within JHMV infected cultures restricted caspase 3 cleavage and increased Bcl-2 expression that was associated with a significant (p\u003C0.001) decrease in apoptosis. CXCR2 deficient oligodendrocytes were refractory to CXCL1 mediated protection from JHMV \u2013 induced apoptosis, readily activating caspase 3 and down regulating Bcl-2. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for CXCR2 signaling in protecting oligodendrocyte lineage cells from apoptosis during inflammatory demyelination initiated by viral infection of the CNS.","publish_time":"2010-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosking, Martin P.; Tirotta, Emanuele; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Lane, Thomas E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c24060d084e314b214e061995b5528b2e0071e31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2893165.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20596532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC","CNS","Multiple Sclerosis","ELR","JHMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","induced apoptosis","CXCR2 neutralization","chronic infection","induced demyelination","CXCR2 deficient oligodendrocytes","binding receptor CXCR2","JHMV infection of enriched oligodendrocyte progenitor cell","increased Bcl","JHMV infected cultures restricted caspase","elevated expression of cleaved caspase","Inclusion of CXCL1","inflammatory demyelination","chronic demyelinating disease","severity of demyelination","muted Bcl","sustained expression of transcripts specific","CXCL1 mediated protection","white matter pathology","oligodendrocyte lineage cells","white matter tracts","functional role of ELR","chemokine ligands CXCL1","independent of viral recrudescence","increased numbers of apoptotic cells","unappreciated role","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","human demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis","CNS of susceptible mice results","cleavage","positive CXC chemokines","refractory","neuroattenuated JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","OPC","acute encephalomyelitis","CXCL2","METHODOLOGY","modulation of neuroinflammation","Inoculation","BACKGROUND","spinal cord","neutralizing antiserum","clinical recovery","CONCLUSION","SIGNIFICANCE"],"language":"en"},

On 26 February 2020, for the first time, the number of new cases outside China was higher than the number of new cases inside China (427 vs. 411 new cases) [2]. By 11 March 2020, the virus had spread to 113 countries and territories, with the number of registered cases reaching 118,162 and the number of deaths reaching 4290 (mortality rate 3.63%) [3]. The WHO states that the COVID-19 outbreak is now categorized as a pandemic, with the number of cases increasing by 13-fold in 2 weeks [4], and has issued alerts to countries at risk of getting COVID-19 [5]. Also on 26 February 2020, the Pakistan Federal Health Minister confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 in Karachi and Islamabad [2, 6]. Within 15 days (12 March), the total number of positive COVID-19 tests reached 20, with 14 cases in Sindh Province, 5 in Gilgit Baltistan and 1 in a 12-year-old child in Baluchistan) [7]. All cases had a history of a recent visit to Iran, Syria or London. To 12 March 2020, a total of 471 suspected samples had been tested, 20 (4.25%) of which were found to be positive [7]. Pakistan borders countries infected with COVID-19, including China, an epicenter of the disease that currently has the highest number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (n = 3162), to the north, and Iran, a country with the third highest number of COVID-19-associated mortalities (n = 291), to the west; Italy has the second highest number of deaths [3].

Beside these newly identified viruses, new respiratory viruses have emerged in humans within the last years. These viruses have been introduced from animal reservoirs and they generally present a high degree of pathogenicity with high level of mortality in humans. These emerging respiratory viruses are represented by the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses), the New World hantaviruses associated with the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, the coronavirus responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and the avian influenza virus H5N1.

There are many point mutations among SARS-CoV genome sequences. Previous studies suggested that the mutations are correlated closely with the SARS epidemic. It was found that the bases of six nucleotide positions (nt9404, nt9479, nt19838, nt21721, nt22222 and nt27827) with high-mutation rate have an important relationship with the SARS epidemic. For viral detection as well as genotyping, a universal microarray system was developed that combines RT-PCR and ligase detection reaction (LDR). The Zip Codes attached covalently to a slide remain constant and their complementary Zip Codes (cZip Codes) can be used for tagging target sequence, making the microarrays universal. The discriminating oligonucleotides contain on the 5\u2032 end \u201CcZip Codes\u201D that are used to direct LDR product to specific Zip Codes attached covalently to a slide. Since Zip Codes have no homology to either the target sequence or to other sequences in the genomes of both human host and SARS-CoV, there was no false signal due to mismatch hybridizations. 20 samples assayed with the universal microarray were confirmed by DNA sequencing, demonstrating that this microarray system is a promising diagnostic tool for detection and genotyping of the SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Long, Wei-Hong; Xiao, Hua-Sheng; Gu, Xiao-Mei; Zhang, Qing-Hua; Yang, Hong-Jun; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Liu, Jian-Hua","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9efbc0272aa40251062b97b94ee330f4fd50a05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112900.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093404001624; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093404001624","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","LDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","SARS coronavirus","cZip Codes","SARS-CoV genome sequences","complementary Zip Codes","specific Zip Codes","universal microarray system","slide","viral detection","microarrays universal","target sequence","genotyping","ligase detection reaction","point mutations","direct LDR product","nt9404","nt9479","nt27827","nt19838","RT-PCR","important relationship","nt22222","high-mutation rate","nt21721","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","promising diagnostic tool","nucleotide positions","human host","DNA sequencing","false signal","genomes","homology","mismatch hybridizations","bases","end","Previous studies","samples","discriminating oligonucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Methods A survey study carried out during August 2009 (before the peak of the pandemic in Spain) in the Hospital Costa del Sol, a second level hospital with almost 300 beds in the South of Spain. The participants were workers in the following hospital units: Emergencies, Medical Area (Internal Medicine, Chest Diseases), Surgical Area (General Surgery and Anaesthesia) of any professional category. A study was made of the proportion of healthcare workers in our hospital with positive serology for the new influenza A (H1N1)2009 virus, as determined by the haemagglutination inhibition technique (\u22651/40). The subjects completed a health status questionnaire, and provided a blood sample for serology testing. Results A total of 239 workers participated, of whom 25.1% had positive serology.

Despite the introduction of a commercial vaccine in some parts of the world, the majority of the populations at risk of infection remain unprotected against this disease, and there is currently no treatment for DENV infection. Natural compounds offer the prospect of cheap and sustainable therapeutics to reduce the disease burden during infection, and thus potentially alleviate the risk of more severe disease. This study evaluated the potential anti-DENV 2 activity of five natural compounds namely melatonin, \u03B1-tocopherol, folic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine and resveratrol in two different cell lines. RESULTS: Screening of the compounds showed that one compound (acetyl-l-carnitine) showed no effect on DENV infection, three compounds (melatonin, \u03B1-tocopherol and folic acid) slightly increased levels of infection, while the 5th compound, resveratrol, showed some limited anti-DENV activity, with resveratrol reducing virus output with an EC(50) of less than 25 \u03BCM. These results suggest that some commonly taken natural compounds may have beneficial effects on DENV infection, but that others may potentially add to the disease burden.

To improve the pig\u2019s robustness and resilience against pathogens through selection, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors in the immune response is required. This review highlights results from the most recent transcriptome research, and the meta-analyses performed, in the context of pig immunity. A technological overview is given including wholegenome microarrays, immune-specific arrays, small-scale high-throughput expression methods, high-density tiling arrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Although whole genome microarray techniques will remain complementary to NGS for some time in domestic species, research will transition to sequencing-based methods due to cost-effectiveness and the extra information that such methods provide. Furthermore, upcoming high-throughput epigenomic studies, which will add greatly to our knowledge concerning the impact of epigenetic modifications on pig immune response, are listed in this review. With emphasis on the insights obtained from transcriptomic analyses for porcine immunity, we also discuss the experimental design in pig immunity research and the value of the newly published porcine genome assembly in using the pig as a model for human immune response. We conclude by discussing the importance of establishing community standards to maximize the possibility of integrative computational analyses, such as was clearly beneficial for the human ENCODE project.

Data were analyzed using t tests and Fisher\u0027s exact tests. RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients (median age: 5 years; range: 5 months\u201319 years) with hMPV infection documented between 2006 and 2010 were identified, including 24 (44%) with hematologic malignancy, 9 (16%) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 9 (16%) with solid tumors, and 8 (15%) with solid organ transplants.

Current treatment options are, at best, palliative. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a panel of nineteen candidate compounds for antiviral activity against FCoV in vitro to determine viable candidates for therapy. A resazurin-based cytopathic effect inhibition assay, which detects viable cells through their reduction of the substrate resazurin to fluorescent resorufin, was developed for screening compounds for antiviral efficacy against FCoV. Plaque reduction and virus yield reduction assays were performed to confirm antiviral effects of candidate compounds identified during screening, and the possible antiviral mechanisms of action of these compounds were investigated using virucidal suspension assays and CPE inhibition and IFA-based time of addition assays. Three compounds, chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene amiloride demonstrated marked inhibition of virus induced CPE at low micromolar concentrations. Orthogonal assays confirmed inhibition of CPE was associated with significant reductions in viral replication. Selectivity indices calculated based on in vitro cytotoxicity screening and reductions in extracellular viral titre were 217, 24, and 20 for chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene amiloride respectively. Preliminary experiments performed to inform the antiviral mechanism of the compounds demonstrated all three acted at an early stage of viral replication.

However, many previous studies have reported that the liquid impingers are surprisingly inefficient for the collection of ultrafine bioaerosols, with collection efficiencies \u003C30%. In the present work, we have successfully improved the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger (AGI30) to as high as 99% for particles in the size range of 20\u2013400nm with the aid of packed glass beads. We also systematically investigated the effects of influential factors on the collection efficiency. These factors include the volume of the sampling liquid (0, 20 and 30mL), depth (0, 7 and 10cm) of packed glass beads and sampling flow rate (4, 6 and 8 liter per min, lpm). According to our experimental results, increasing the depth of packed glass beads and the volume of sampling liquid can enhance the collection efficiency. Also, decreasing the sampling flow rate can increase the collection efficiency and reduce the loss of sampling liquid. For the sampling of viable MS2 phages, the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads is much higher than that without packed glass beads. Conclusively, this study validates that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency of liquid impingers for submicron and ultrafine particles and viral aerosols.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Kuo-Pin; Chen, Yen-Ping; Gong, Jia-You; Chen, Yen-Chi; Cheng, Chih-Ching","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e5563e90ad2d3e85c2692067b90cbb204f006b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287369/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850216300143; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850216300143; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.08.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collection efficiency of liquid impingers","volume of sampling liquid","loss of sampling liquid","collection efficiencies","collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler","depth of packed glass beads","collection of ultrafine bioaerosols","aid of packed glass beads","Abstract Liquid impingers","sampling flow rate","sampling of viable MS2 phages","ultrafine particles","effects of influential factors","submicron","nm","granular bed filtration","viral aerosols","study","size range","liter","experimental results","previous studies","dehydration of biological agents","advantages","present work","lpm"],"language":"en"},

The combination of antigen-specific immunotherapy with the employment of immunomodulatory agents has emerged as a potentially plausible approach for the control of advanced cancer. METHODS: In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in tumor-bearing mice. RESULTS: We observed that treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to an enhancement in the E7-specific CD8\u002B T cell immune responses and a decrease in the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to significantly improved antitumor effects and prolonged survival in treated mice. In addition, treatment with imiquimod led to increased number of NK1.1\u002B cells and F4/80\u002B cells in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages and NK1.1\u002B cells were found to play an important role in the antitumor effects mediated by treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our data suggests that the combination of therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination with topical treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod enhances the antitumor immunity induced by DNA vaccination. The current study has significant implications for future clinical translation.","publish_time":"2010-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Chi-Mu; Monie, Archana; Hung, Chien-Fu; Wu, T-C","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a762208186ddb3827966e6d7bec5a4fb8a0124cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2873498.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426849/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-17-32","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E7 DNA","CRT","E7 antigen","combination of antigen","E7-specific CD8","antitumor effects","E7-specific immune responses","DNA vaccine","combination of therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination","TLR7 agonist imiquimod","tumor microenvironment of tumor","topical treatment","antitumor immunity","specific immunotherapy","derived suppressor cells","control of advanced cancer","current study","treated mice","increased number of NK1","T cell immune responses","number of myeloid","significant implications","new innovative therapies","decrease","ability","urgent need","future clinical translation","prolonged survival","calreticulin","enhancement","employment of immunomodulatory agents","human papillomavirus type","plausible approach","important role","data","F4","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Macrophages","addition","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Infection of a new host species can manifest as a distinct disease. In this respect, the use of non\u2010human viruses in clinical therapy may be a cause for concern. It could provide the opportunity for the viruses to adapt to the new host and be transferred to the recipient\u0027s relatives or medical caretakers, or even to the normal host species. Such environmental impact is evidently undesirable. To forecast future clinical use of non\u2010human viruses, a literature study was performed to identify the viruses that are being considered for application as therapeutic agents for use in humans. Twenty\u2010seven non\u2010human virus species were identified that are in (pre)clinical development, mainly as oncolytic agents. For risk management, it is essential that the potential environmental consequences are assessed before initiating clinical use, even if the virus is not formally classified as a genetically modified organism. To aid such assessment, each of these viruses was classified in one of five relative environmental risk categories, ranging from \u201CNegligible\u201D to \u201CVery High\u201D. Canary pox virus and the Autographa californica baculovirus were assigned a \u201CNegligible\u201D classification, and Seneca Valley virus, murine leukemia virus, and Maraba virus to the \u201CHigh\u201D category. A complicating factor in the classification is the scarcity of publicly available information on key aspects of virus biology in some species. In such cases the relative environmental risk score was increased as a precaution.

Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to na\u00EFve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four na\u00EFve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two na\u00EFve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.

These concerns persist for INSs despite significant or marked clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption and among the INSs in bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs. For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (eg, epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates that are similar to those with placebo. Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts, which suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demoly, Pascal","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa36e8d21c62925bbaa87429a45a81d0ef78b154.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115254.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070907002165; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2007.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144302/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070907002165","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of INSs","safety profiles of INSs","systemic corticosteroids","systemic bioavailability","systemic absorption","evidence of systemic AEs","acute RS","local AEs","safety of mometasone furoate","chronic RS","acute rhinosinusitis","fluticasone propionate","clinical differences","triamcinolone acetonide","concerns","clinical trials","administered drug","use of intranasal corticosteroids","profiles of oral glucocorticoids","adrenal axis","bone mineral density loss","allergic rhinitis","budesonide","hypothalamic-pituitary","suppression","cataracts","monotherapy","growth retardation","Abstract Treatment guidelines","occurrence rates","children","mechanism of action","percentage","patients","adverse event","lipophilicity","epistaxis","adjunctive therapy","Studies","agents","review","headache","example","beclomethasone dipropionate","placebo"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A procedure has been developed to determine the virucidal activity of peracetic acid-based airborne disinfectants on a resistant non-enveloped virus poliovirus type 1. This virus was laid on a stainless carrier. The products were spread into the room by hot fogging at 55\u00B0C for 30 minutes at a concentration of 7.5 mL.m(-3). Poliovirus inoculum, supplemented with 5%, heat inactivated non fat dry organic milk, were applied into the middle of the stainless steel disc and were dried under the air flow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature. The Viral preparations were recovered by using flocked swabs and were titered on Vero cells using the classical Spearman-K\u00E4rber CPE reading method, the results were expressed as TCID50.ml(-1). RESULTS: The infectious titer of dried poliovirus inocula was kept at 10(5) TCID(50).mL(-1) up to 150 minutes at room temperature. Dried inocula exposed to airborne peracetic acid containing disinfectants were recovered at 60 and 120 minutes post-exposition and suspended in culture medium again.

The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well. With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans.

At present, the role of viral and bacterial components as primary or secondary pathogens in CIRD is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine herpes virus-1 (CHV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica in dogs with CIRD and to compare the data with findings in healthy dogs. Sixty-one dogs with CIRD and 90 clinically healthy dogs from Southern Germany were prospectively enrolled in this study. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from all dogs and were analysed for CPIV, CAV-2, CIV, CRCoV, CHV-1, CDV, and B. bronchiseptica by real-time PCR. In dogs with acute respiratory signs, 37.7% tested positive for CPIV, 9.8% for CRCoV and 78.7% for B. bronchiseptica. Co-infections with more than one agent were detected in 47.9% of B. bronchiseptica-positive, 82.6% of CPIV-positive, and 100% of CRCoV-positive dogs. In clinically healthy dogs, 1.1% tested positive for CAV-2, 7.8% for CPIV and 45.6% for B. bronchiseptica. CPIV and B. bronchiseptica were detected significantly more often in dogs with CIRD than in clinically healthy dogs (P \u003C 0.001 for each pathogen) and were the most common infectious agents in dogs with CIRD in Southern Germany. Mixed infections with several pathogens were common. In conclusion, clinically healthy dogs can carry respiratory pathogens and could act as sources of infection for susceptible dogs.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schulz, B.

Rhubarb is one of the oldest and best-known traditional Chinese medicines. We initiated this study to test if emodin is the active ingredients from Rheum tanguticum (R. tanguticum, one of the Chinese Rhubarb) against HSV infection and to investigate its antiviral activity on HSV infection in tissue culture cells and in a mouse model. Materials and methods Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) was extracted and purified from R. tanguticum (cultivated at high mountainous area in Qinghai) and the purity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The antiviral experiments of emodin against HSV infection were performed in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the HSV-infected mice were orally administered with emodin beginning at 24h post-HSV exposures with dosages of 3.3g/kg/day, 6.7g/kg/day, and 11.3g/kg/day, respectively, for 7 days. Results Emodin was found to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cell culture at the concentration of 50\u03BCg/ml with antiviral index of 2.07 and 3.53, respectively. The emodin treatment increased the survival rate of HSV-infected mice, prolonged survival time and showed higher efficacy of HSV elimination from brain, heart, liver and ganglion, compared to the viral controls. In addition, the antiviral activity of emodin was found to be equivalent to that of acyclovir in vivo. Conclusions Our results indicate that emodin has the anti-HSV activity in vitro and in vivo and is thus a promising agent in the clinical therapy of HSV infection.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Hai-Rong; Luo, Jun; Hou, Wei; Xiao, Hong; Yang, Zhan-Qiu","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d653d9860ec8395a6d1b7f6369c51b8e63dfe214.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126445.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874110007695; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.10.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21050882/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874110007695","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":["Qinghai"],"keyphrases":["HSV exposures","replication of HSV","anti-HSV activity","HSV-infected mice","survival rate of HSV","antiviral activity of emodin","Results Emodin","clinical therapy of HSV infection","emodin treatment","methods Emodin","antiviral experiments of emodin","higher efficacy of HSV elimination","discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs","antiviral index","Rheum tanguticum","Chinese Rhubarb","cell culture","prolonged survival time","tissue culture cells","high mountainous area","study Herpes simplex viruses","best-known traditional Chinese medicines","high performance liquid chromatography","brain","low toxicity","ganglion","purity","humans","heart","Abstract Aim","great efforts","active ingredients","liver","Qinghai","\u03BCg","dosages","mouse model","promising agent","important pathogens","concentration","methyl","addition","viral controls","Materials","Conclusions","acyclovir","trihydroxyanthraquinone","days"],"language":"en"},

Key background issues include the following: the fact that the laboratory is only one of several data providers to a surveillance system, the biologic nature of influenza and respiratory viruses and the laboratory needs to keep up to date on the diagnosis of these agents, the need for laboratorians to be involved in case definition development, the impact of push and pull data flow models on laboratory resources, and the fact that laboratories may be asked to provide more than just test results to surveillance programs.

Besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssDNA viruses, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssDNA viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA virus diversity has probably been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between various different ssDNA virus species and we look here at the various roles that these different types of recombination may play, both in the day-to-day biology, and in the longer term evolution, of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying patterns of genetic exchange detectable amongst the ssDNA viruses and discuss how these should all be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution.","publish_time":"2011-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Darren P.; Biagini, Philippe; Lefeuvre, Pierre; Golden, Michael; Roumagnac, Philippe; Varsani, Arvind","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6f36e3233319626ec737895c1d52dedd7aac0bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3187698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v3091699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse ssDNA viruses","ssDNA viruses of plants","ssDNA virus evolution","animal-infecting ssDNA viruses","genetic recombination","global ssDNA virus diversity","various different ssDNA virus species","metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules","non-homologous recombination","different types of recombination","adaptive value of recombination","High rates of homologous recombination","various roles","Various lines of evidence","known plant","longer term evolution","patterns of genetic exchange detectable","important components of global ecosystems","generation","selective factors","large numbers","genome component reassortment","humans","major diseases","arthropod","pivotal evolutionary process","temperate regions","food production","domesticated animals","result","tree of life","day-to-day biology","aquatic environments","world","host ranges"],"language":"en"},

The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor\u2019s diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. RESULTS: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. DISCUSSION: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yuliang; Zhang, Quan; Zhao, Geng; Liu, Guohua; Liu, Zhiang","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58cc585d5006605aef48cb1e6f9aabe797971d20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073442.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s242585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32210601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic hyperlipemia","corresponding diagnostic markers","diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia","new diagnostic markers","disease diagnostic markers","auxiliary diagnostic tool","study of diagnostic basis","diagnosis basis","improvement of diagnostic accuracy","improvement of medical diagnostic techniques","research of auxiliary diagnosis","improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques","medical diagnosis level","auxiliary diagnosis system","doctor\u2019s diagnosis results","efficiency of clinical diagnosis","proposed model","medical data","preliminary diagnosis of patients","implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm","Traditional research methods","different physiological parameters","Human physiological parameters","attention mechanism","degree of attention","attention layer","research period","hematological parameters","Research objects","medical text data faces challenges","attention deep learning algorithm","large amounts of data","diseases","time","reliability of traditional methods","clinical practice","paper","positive effect","positive significance","dozens of samples","interpretability","development","great potential","creditability","input","specificity","economic costs","comprehensiveness","output","DISCUSSION","INTRODUCTION","golden criteria","AUC","sensitivity","test dataset","robust performance","extent","hotspots","world","establishment"],"language":"en"},

Patients: Forty-eight cases admitted to our PICU over a 5-year period in whom a diagnosis of tracheobronchial malacia or stenosis was made by dynamic contrast bronchography (1994\u20131999). Interventions: Conservative management, tracheostomy and long-term ventilation, surgical correction, internal or external airway stenting. Measurements and results: Recording of clinical details, length of invasive ventilation and appearance at contrast bronchography. Five groups of patients were defined: isolated primary airway pathology (n=7), ex-premature infants (n=11), vascular rings (n=9), complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (n=17) and tracheo-oesophageal fistulae (n=4). The overall mortality was 29%. Median length of invasive ventilation in survivors was 38 days and in patients who died 45. Mortality was highest in the patients with complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (p=0.039 Cox regression analysis) but was not related to any other factor.

Socioeconomic status may play a partial but important role in mortality and recovery. Therefore, the detection of factors that are responsible for poor long-term outcomes would be beneficial in designing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. METHODS: For an endpoint analysis, 1834 intensive care unit patients with known French Deprivation Index (FDep) scores were included from the French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study, which was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study performed in 20 French intensive care units in 13 different hospitals. Socioeconomic status was defined by using the FDep score [represented as quintiles when referring to the general French population, as quintiles when referring to the FROG-ICU cohort, or as dichotomized data (which was defined as a FDep \u2264 0 for nondeprived patients)] and by using a detailed social questionnaire that was completed 3 months after discharge. The primary outcome included an all-cause, 1-year mortality after ICU discharge when regarding socioeconomic status. The secondary outcomes included both ICU and hospital lengths of stay, both short- and medium-term mortality, and the quality of life, as assessed during the 1-year follow-up by using the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). The Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) was used to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of the 1447 patients who were discharged alive from the ICU, 19.2% died over the following year. No association was found between 1-year mortality and socioeconomic status, regardless of whether this association was analyzed in quintiles (p = 0.911 in the quintiles of the general French population; p = 0.589 in the quintiles of the FROG-ICU cohort itself) or as dichotomized data [nondeprived (n = 177; 1-year mortality of 18.2%) versus deprived (n = 97; 1-year mortality of 20.5%; p = 0.304)]. Moreover, no differences were found between the nondeprived and the deprived patients in the ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ICU mortalities, in-hospital mortalities, or 28-day mortalities. The SF-36 was below the score for the normal French population throughout the follow-up period. Socially deprived patients showed significantly lower median scores in the physical function subscale [55, interquartile range (IQR) (28.8\u201380) vs. 65, IQR (35\u201390); p = 0.014], the physical role subscale [25, IQR (0\u201375) vs. 33.3, IQR (0\u2013100); p = 0.022], and the overall physical component scale [47.5, IQR (30\u201368.8) vs. 54.4, IQR (35\u201378.8); p = 0.010]. Up to 31.6% of survivors presented symptoms that indicated post-traumatic stress disorder, and up to 31.5% of survivors reported clinically meaningful symptoms of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: A lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower self-reported physical component scores in the nondeprived patients. Psychiatric symptoms are frequently reported after an ICU stay, and subsequent interventions should target those fields.

We assessed the benefits and harms of AT III in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched from inception to 27 August 2015 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAB, BIOSIS and CINAHL. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published or language. RESULTS: We included 30 RCTs with a total of 3933 participants. The majority of included trials were at high risk of bias. Combining all trials, regardless of bias, showed no statistically significant effect of AT III on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.88\u20131.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 29 trials, 3882 participants). Among those with severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), AT III showed no impact on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % Cl 0.88\u20131.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 12 trials, 2858 participants). We carried out multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the benefits and harms of AT III and to examine the impact of risk of bias. AT III significantly increased bleeding events (RR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.35\u20131.84, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 11 trials, 3019 participants). However, for all other outcome measures and analyses, the results did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support AT III substitution in any category of critically ill participants including those with sepsis and DIC. AT III did not show an impact on mortality, but increased the risk of bleeding.

Repair, on the other hand, allows restoring the function of an existing but failing organ. The recognition that human lungs can both repair and regenerate is quite novel, the concept has not been widely used to treat patients. We present evidence that the human adult lung does repair and regenerate and introduce different ways to harness this power. Various types of lung stem cells are capable of proliferating and differentiating upon injury driving the repair/regeneration process. Injury models, primarily in mice, combined with lineage tracing studies, have allowed the identification of these important cells. Some of these cells, such as basal cells, broncho-alveolar stem cells, and alveolar type 2 cells, rely on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling for their survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. While preclinical studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of FGFs, a recent clinical trial for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using intravenous injection of FGF7 did not report the expected beneficial effects. We discuss the potential reasons for these negative results and propose the rationale for new approaches for future clinical trials, such as delivery of FGFs to the damaged lungs through efficient inhalation systems, which may be more promising than systemic exposure to FGFs. While this change in the administration route presents a challenge, the therapeutic promises displayed by FGFs are worth the effort.","publish_time":"2019-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Xuran; Chen, Chengshui; Chen, Chaolei; Zhang, Jin-San; Bellusci, Saverio; Li, Xiaokun","journal":"Front Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2abf2bec88817e4e43ef15f0dd7651f96a0f86df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzYwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Repair","basal cells","important cells","broncho-alveolar stem cells","delivery of FGFs","Various types of lung stem cells","therapeutic benefits of FGFs","human lungs","regenerate","human adult lung","alveolar type","damaged lungs","therapeutic promises","preclinical studies","Injury models","regeneration process","missing organ","recent clinical trial","future clinical trials","lineage tracing studies","acute respiratory distress syndrome","ARDS","rationale","new approaches","capable of proliferating","mice","intravenous injection of FGF7","efficient inhalation systems","negative results","fibroblast growth factor","challenge","present evidence","identification","administration route","survival","potential reasons","function","idea of regrowing","systemic exposure","recognition","expected beneficial effects","different ways","power","proliferation","differentiation","change","concept","hand","effort","patients"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study in which each patient served as his/her own control. SETTING: Multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric ICU.

INTERVENTIONS: Salbutamol, 10 \u03BCg/kg was given intravenously, and 10\u201319 h later, twice 100 \u03BCg as pressurized aerosol, or vice versa, sequence randomized. The pressurized aerosol was delivered by a metered dose inhaler into a newly developed aerosol holding chamber, integrated into the inspiratory limb of the patient circuit. Respiratory system mechanics were assessed by the single breath occlusion method before and 10 and 60 min after drug administration. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Compliance improved significantly after intravenous injection (0.48\u00B10.18 to 0.67\u00B10.16, p\u003C0.01 and 0.59\u00B10.23 ml/cmH(2)O/kg, NS, (mean\u00B11 SD) and after inhalation (0.46\u00B10.19 to 0.64\u00B10.32,p\u003C0.01 and 0.56\u00B10.31 ml/cmH(2)O/kg, NS).

The dynamics of NF-kB-activation as well as its down-stream regulation of IL-8-expression in PMN following major trauma remain unclear. The aim of this pilot study was to analyse NF-kB nuclear translocation in relation to IL- 8-mRNA-expression in PMN after major trauma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PMN were isolated from blood samples of 15 major trauma patients (New Injury Severity Score, NISS \u003E 16) drawn within 90 min and subsequently 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after trauma. NF-kB-translocation was analysed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, EMSA and quantified by densitometry [arbitrary units], IL-8-mRNA-expression by RT-PCR, [copies/50 ng RNA]. Additionally, NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-expression in PMN of healthy volunteers were analysed natively (-control) and after LPS stimulation (\u002Bcontrol). RESULTS: NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-mRNA-expression was significantly increased in polytrauma patients (n=15; NISS: 34 \u00B1 8 [mean \u00B1 SEM]) initially. In non-survivors, NFkB- translocation was significantly increased on admission and subsequently reduced within 6 h, while it increased in the survivors group. After 24 h, a second significant increase in NF-kB-activity and IL-8-expression was found in survivors that was subsequently reduced in both groups. CONCLUSION: This pilot study has shown that a concomitant initial increase in transcriptional NF-kB-activity and IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in the early posttraumatic period which preceded the down-regulation of the innate immune system.","publish_time":"2008-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stegmaier, J.

New targeted and individualized therapies and drugs provide a survival benefit for an increasing number of patients, but can also cause severe side effects. An increasing number of oncology patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) because of cancer-related complications or treatment-associated side effects. Postoperative care, respiratory distress and sepsis are the leading causes for admission. Tumor mass syndromes and tumor lysis may require urgent treatment. Traditional anticancer chemotherapy is associated with infections and immunosuppression. Newer agents are generally well-tolerated and side effects are mild or moderate, but overwhelming inflammation and autoimmunity can also occur. Cellular treatment, such as with chimeric antigen receptor modified T\u2011cells, monoclonal and bispecific antibodies targeting immune effectors and tumor cells are associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with hypotension, skin reactions and fever. It is related to excessively high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), such as colitis and endocrine disorders. Noninfectious respiratory complications, such as pneumonitis can also occur. Recent studies revealed that short-term and medium-term survival of cancer patients is better than previously expected. In this review article we summarize diagnostic and treatment strategies for common life-threatening complications and emergencies requiring ICU admission. Furthermore, strategies for rational admission policies are presented.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annecke, T.; Hohn, A.; B\u00F6ll, B.; Kochanek, M.","journal":"Anaesthesist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a2f12f9b633c6b7b8f627f381c21505a628fafe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095836.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment-associated","treatment strategies","cancer-related complications","effects","tumor cells","urgent treatment","ICU admission","Cellular treatment","increasing number of patients","medium-term survival of cancer patients","tumor lysis","immune effectors","Noninfectious respiratory complications","immune-related adverse events","increasing number of oncology patients","common life-threatening complications","Tumor mass syndromes","Immune checkpoint inhibitors","leading causes of death","rational admission policies","survival benefit","Postoperative care","respiratory distress","intensive care units","bispecific antibodies","sepsis","hypotension","CRS","drugs","emergencies","individualized therapies","cytokine release syndrome","chimeric antigen receptor","IRAEs","infections","overwhelming inflammation","skin reactions","Recent studies","review article","Traditional anticancer chemotherapy","high levels of inflammatory cytokines","colitis","autoimmunity","Newer agents","fever","pneumonitis","endocrine disorders","immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

The national tactics were to slow down its importation through international air travelers and to slow down its spread in cities and major towns.

Its C-terminal domain (CTD) has been shown to associate with intracellular membrane, and we have previously shown that NS4B CTD contains a class I PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Here, we demonstrated that NS4B PBM interacts with the PDZ-containing tumor suppressor protein, Scribble, using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and this interaction requires at least three contiguous PDZ domains of Scribble. In addition, NS4B PBM specifically induced Scribble degradation by activating the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. Similar Scribble degradation was also observed in HCV-infected cells, suggesting NS4B could work in the context of HCV. Finally, NS4B PBM mutants showed reduced colony formation capacity compared with its wild-type counterpart, indicating that NS4B PBM plays important roles in NS4B-mediated cell transformation. Altogether, we provide a mechanism by which NS4B induces cell transformation through its PBM, which specifically interacts with the PDZ domains of Scribble and targets Scribble for degradation.","publish_time":"2016-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Bo; Li, Shanshan; Zhang, Zhanfeng; Xie, Shenggao; Hu, Yuqian; Huang, Xianzhang; Zheng, Yi","journal":"Tumour Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/696d22cfc1e5f627786b38e5267dab5f7f22bbbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozg2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD","PBM","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS4B CTD","NS4B PBM mutants","NS4B-mediated cell transformation","targets Scribble","induced Scribble degradation","Similar Scribble degradation","contiguous PDZ domains of Scribble","HCV replication","context of HCV","nonstructural protein","PDZ-binding motif","HCV-infected cells","tumor suppressor protein","multi-transmembrane protein","Hepatitis C virus","C-terminal domain","reduced colony formation capacity","important roles","interaction","immunofluorescence","class","co-immunoprecipitation assays","wild-type counterpart","addition","proteasome-ubiquitin pathway","tumorigenesis","mechanism","intracellular membrane"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Focussing on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the paper employs descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies in nine western democracies. To probe the plausibility of the novel explanation, it uses quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media attention and coverage in two deviant cases, the USA and Denmark. FINDINGS: Theories linking political survival to disaster responses find little empirical support in the substantial cross-country variations of vaccination responses during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Rather than following a political logic, the case studies of media coverage in the USA and Denmark demonstrate that the response was bureaucratized in the public health agencies (CDC and DMHA, respectively). Hence, while natural disaster responses appear to follow a political logic, the response to pandemics appears to be more strongly instituted in the hands of bureaucratic experts. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: There is an added value of encompassing bureaucratic dynamics in political theories of disaster response; bureaucratized expertise proved to constitute a strong plausible explanation of the 2009 pandemic vaccination response. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pandemic preparedness and response depends critically on understanding the lessons of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; a key lesson supported by this paper is that expert-based agencies rather than political leaders are the pivotal actors. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper is the first to pinpoint the limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses with respect to the 2009 pandemic. Further, it is among the few to analyze the causes of variations in cross-country pandemic vaccination policies during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.","publish_time":"2014-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baekkeskov, Erik; Rubin, Olivier","journal":"Disaster Prev Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7098007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozg5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","CDC"],"locations":["Denmark"],"keyphrases":["pandemic response","H1N1 pandemic","pandemic vaccination response","Pandemic preparedness","cross-country pandemic vaccination policies","political theories of disaster response","influenza pandemic vaccination policies","political logic","political leaders","paper","limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses","theory of political survival","natural disaster responses","substantial cross-country variations of vaccination responses","bureaucratized experts","descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies","USA","bureaucratized expertise","Denmark","PURPOSE","hands of bureaucratic experts","case studies of media coverage","bureaucratic dynamics","causes of variations","novel explanation","PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS","added value","RESEARCH LIMITATIONS","public health agencies","strong plausible explanation","expert-based agencies","qualitative content analyses of media attention","little empirical support","predictions","deviant cases","swine","respect","CDC","DMHA","key lesson","western democracies","APPROACH","elected politicians","pivotal actors","FINDINGS","pandemics","lessons","DESIGN","METHODOLOGY","plausibility","ORIGINALITY"],"language":"en"},

The use of appropriate biosafety measures is very important in case of management of patients deceased from highly infectious diseases (HIDs), such as Ebola virus disease. This paper presents the capabilities and resources in this field in 16 European countries, and suggests indications for the safe post-mortem management of HID patients. METHODS: The European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted in 2009 a survey in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries. A set of standardized checklists, filled during on-site visits, have been used for data collection. RESULTS: Thirty-nine facilities (81.2 %) reported to have written procedures for the management of human remains, and 27 (56.2 %) for the performance of autopsies in HID patients. A Biosafety Level 3 autopsy room was available in eight (16.6 %) facilities, other technical devices for safe autopsies were available in nine (18.7 %). Overall, four facilities (8.3 %) reported to have all features explored for the safe management of human remains. Conversely, in five (10.4 %) none of these features were available. CONCLUSIONS: The level of preparedness of surveyed isolation facilities in the field of post-mortem management in case of HIDs was not satisfactory, and improvements are needed.","publish_time":"2015-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fusco, Francesco M.; Scappaticci, Lucia; Schilling, Stefan; De Iaco, Giuseppina; Brouqui, Philippe; Maltezou, Helena C.; Brodt, Hans-Reinhard; Bannister, Barbara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Puro, Vincenzo","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09879c5f821a55063fb3952102d9e0148c30ba93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The European Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of management","safe management of human remains","field of post-mortem management","safe post-mortem management of HID patients","surveyed isolation facilities","safe autopsies","infectious diseases","European countries","handling of human remains","case of HIDs","Biosafety Level","European Network","infectious agents","features","level of preparedness","performance of autopsies","use of appropriate biosafety measures","risk","technical devices","indications","resources","transmission","autopsy room","on-site visits","set of standardized checklists","written procedures","capabilities","PURPOSE","Ebola virus disease","paper","improvements","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","data collection","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

SARS was identified in Hong Kong in late February 2003 and the WHO issued a global alert on 12 March, 2003. The incubation period of SARS is usually 4\u20136 days and patients commonly present with high fever (temperature \u003E38\u00B0C), dry cough, chills and rigor, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Although a specific antiviral agent and vaccines for SARS are not available at the time of writing, a standard treatment protocol for SARS has been developed. The average mortality rate is about 16% in Hong Kong. The coronavirus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for SARS. Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both these infections. Transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host\u2019s mucous membrane, most commonly the nose, but also the mouth and eyes. With appropriate preventive measures to avoid contact with virus, the probability of infection is minimal. Isolation of those who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected SARS patients and/or who have persistent fever will be the most effective and practical method of avoiding contact. Maintaining personal hygiene and frequent hand washing can also reduce the risk of infection. Using diluted bleach (1 part bleach in 99 parts water) to cleanse training areas and equipment is also recommended. With proper event planning to conform with quarantine measures, special travel arrangements, facility sterilisation and use of venues with good ventilation and filtering systems, sport competition can still proceed.","publish_time":"2012-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"So, Raymond C.

Transmission of SARS occurred through direct and indirect contact and large droplet nuclei. The World Health Organization recommended the use of household disinfectants, which have not been previously tested against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to disinfect potentially contaminated environmental surfaces. There is a need for a surrogate test system given the limited availability of the SARS-CoV for testing and biosafety requirements necessary to safely handle it. In this study, the antiviral activity of standard household products was assayed against murine hepatitis virus (MHV), as a potential surrogate for SARS-CoV. Methods A surface test method, which involves drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the product for a specific contact time, was used to determine the virucidal activity. The virus titers and log reductions were determined by the Reed and Muench tissue culture infective dose (TCID)50 end point method. Results When tested as directed, common household disinfectants or antiseptics, containing either 0.050% of triclosan, 0.12% of PCMX, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79% of ethanol, demonstrated a 3-log reduction or better against MHV without any virus recovered in a 30-second contact time. Conclusion Common household disinfectants and antiseptics were effective at inactivating MHV, a possible surrogate for SARS-CoV, from surfaces when used as directed. In an outbreak caused by novel agents, it is important to know the effectiveness of disinfectants and antiseptics to prevent or reduce the possibility of human-to-human transmission via surfaces.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dellanno, Christine; Vega, Quinn; Boesenberg, Diane","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78105213b5413694357b77b5f55f6750db8250fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132643.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19692148/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665530900594X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665530900594X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Muench"],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization","PCMX","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Transmission of SARS","SARS coronavirus","antiseptics","use of household disinfectants","Conclusion Common household disinfectants","effectiveness of disinfectants","virus titers","inactivating MHV","possible surrogate","surrogate test system","potential surrogate","indirect contact","murine hepatitis virus","surface test method","human transmission","specific contact time","antiviral activity of standard household products","contaminated environmental surfaces","log reductions","possibility of human","virucidal activity","end point method","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","TCID","Reed","Muench tissue culture infective dose","limited availability","testing","large droplet nuclei","biosafety requirements necessary","World Health Organization","sodium hypochlorite","PCMX","ethanol","novel agents","study","need","Methods","pine oil","quaternary compound","triclosan","Results","people"],"language":"en"},

In particular, in recent years, through modification with immunopotentiators and targeting molecules, and in combination with innovative immunization devices, liposomes are rapidly developed as a multifunctional vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) that has a high capability in inducing desired immunoresponses, as they can target immune cells and even cellular organelles, engender lysosome escape, and promote Ag cross-presentation, thus enormously enhancing vaccination efficacy. Moreover, after decades of development, several products developed on liposome VADS have already been authorized for clinical immunization and are showing great advantages over conventional vaccines. This article describes in depth some critical issues relevant to the development of liposomes as a VADS, including principles underlying immunization, physicochemical properties of liposomes as the immunity-influencing factors, functional material modification to enhance immunostimulatory functions, the state-of-the-art liposome VADSs, as well as the marketed vaccines based on a liposome VADS.

METHODS: We monitored a cohort of school children in rural Haiti from May 2014, through February 2015, for occurrence of acute undifferentiated febrile illness, with clinical and laboratory data available for 252 illness episodes. RESULTS: Our findings document passage of the major CHIKV epidemic between May and July 2014, with 82 laboratory-confirmed cases. Subsequent peaks of febrile illness were found to incorporate smaller outbreaks of dengue virus serotypes 1 and 4 and Zika virus, with identification of additional infections with Mayaro virus, enterovirus D68, and coronavirus NL63. CHIKV and dengue virus serotype 1 infections were more common in older children, with a complaint of arthralgia serving as a significant predictor for infection with CHIKV (odds ratio, 16.2; 95% confidence interval, 8.0\u201334.4; positive predictive value, 66%; negative predictive value, 80%). CONCLUSIONS: Viral/arboviral infections were characterized by a pattern of recurrent outbreaks and case clusters, with the CHIKV epidemic representing just one of several arboviral agents moving through the population. Although clinical presentations of these agents are similar, arthralgias are highly suggestive of CHIKV infection.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ball, Jacob D; Elbadry, Maha A; Telisma, Taina; White, Sarah K; Chavannes, Sonese; Anilis, Marie Gina; Prosperi, Mattia; Cummings, Derek A T; Lednicky, John A; Morris, J Glenn; Beau de Rochars, Madsen","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49fbca70a4e7e3018cab7eb445683c58fd06bce2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399436.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184178/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy582","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":["Caribbean","Haiti"],"keyphrases":["suggestive of CHIKV infection","major CHIKV epidemic","Mayaro virus","Zika virus","epidemic of chikungunya virus","arboviral infections","smaller outbreaks of dengue virus serotypes","illness episodes","arboviral agents","cases","Subsequent peaks of febrile illness","identification of additional infections","negative predictive value","positive predictive value","occurrence of acute undifferentiated febrile illness","older children","clinical presentations","pattern of recurrent outbreaks","laboratory data available","cohort of school children","enterovirus D68","case clusters","findings document passage","significant predictor","arthralgias","rural Haiti","complaint of arthralgia","odds ratio","coronavirus NL63","countries","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Caribbean","Western hemisphere","confidence interval","population","METHODS","end","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

S-nitrosothiols (thionitrites, RSNO) appear as endogenous reaction products of NO or NO metabolites with sulfhydryl groups. Prime targets are the sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues found in many different proteins or the thiol moieties on endogenous glutathione (GSH) or cysteine (Cys). The nitrosation of the sulfhydryl moiety leads to S-nitrosothiols with high and low molecular weight, respectively. The interest in the S-nitrosothiols was motivated by the observation that these compounds form in vivo and may elicit physiological responses that are strongly reminiscent of free NO radicals. Well-documented examples are vasodilation and the inhibition of platelet aggregation.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Faassen, Ernst; Vanin, Anatoly F.","journal":"Radicals for Life","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9476da0080e6706a0f65b17dd306245980a26e8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152416.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444522368500095; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444522368500095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-nitrosothiols","sulfhydryl groups","low molecular weight","sulfhydryl moiety","endogenous glutathione","cysteine residues","endogenous reaction products","vasodilation","thiol moieties","GSH","RSNO","different proteins","metabolites","thionitrites","inhibition of platelet aggregation","Well-documented examples","reminiscent of free","Prime targets","physiological responses","chapter","Publisher Summary","compounds","radicals","nitrosation","observation"],"language":"en"},

The frameshift takes place at the slippery sequence with the two ribosome-bound tRNAs slipping back simultaneously by one nucleotide from the zero phase (U UUA AAC) to the \u22121 phase (UUU AAA). Asparaginyl-tRNA, which decodes the A-site codon AAC, has the modified base Q at the wobble position of the anticodon (5\u2032 QUU 3\u2032) and it has been speculated that Q may be required for frameshifting. To test this, we measured frameshifting in cos cells that had been passaged in growth medium containing calf serum or horse serum. Growth in horse serum, which contains no free queuine, eliminates Q from the cellular tRNA population upon repeated passage. Over ten cell passages, however, we found no significant difference in frameshift efficiency between the cell types, arguing against a role for Q in frameshifting. We confirmed that the cells cultured in horse serum were devoid of Q by purifying tRNAs and assessing their Q-content by tRNA transglycosylase assays and coupled HPLC-mass spectroscopy. Supplementation of the growth medium of cells grown either on horse serum or calf serum with free queuine had no effect on frameshifting either. These findings were recapitulated in an in vitro system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates that had been largely depleted of endogenous tRNAs and resupplemented with Q-free or Q-containing tRNA populations. Thus Q-base is not required for frameshifting at the IBV signal and some other explanation is required to account for the slipperiness of eukaryotic asparaginyl-tRNA.","publish_time":"2000-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marczinke, Beate; Hagervall, Tord; Brierley, Ian","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5987eb1a08525b36ae6ea012ce899031c4b032cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126154.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283699933612; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699933612","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Q-free","Q-base","horse serum","Q-content","devoid of Q","modified base Q","efficient frameshifting","growth medium containing calf serum","tRNA populations","growth medium of cells","free queuine","frameshift signal","tRNA transglycosylase assays","cellular tRNA population","slipperiness of eukaryotic asparaginyl-tRNA","IBV signal","frameshift efficiency","phase","cos cells","endogenous tRNAs","heptameric slippery sequence","ribosome-bound tRNAs","cell types","cell passages","site codon AAC","U UUA AAC","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","UUUAAAC","cis-acting signals essential","coupled HPLC-mass spectroscopy","wobble position","system","repeated passage","role","effect","significant difference","RNA pseudoknot structure","rabbit reticulocyte lysates","anticodon","nucleotide","place","Supplementation","UUU AAA","explanation","QUU","findings"],"language":"en"},

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49\u00B70 years (IQR 41\u00B70\u201358\u00B70). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8\u00B70 days [IQR 5\u00B70\u201313\u00B70]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03B1. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

To date, no integrated analysis of patient-derived and external factors has been reported. To identify factors associated with COPD exacerbation, we collected data, including smoking status, lung function, and COPD assessment test scores, from 594 COPD patients in the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS), and merged these data with patients\u2019 Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data for 2007\u20132012. We also collected primary weather variables, including levels of particulate matter \u003C10 microns in diameter, daily minimum ambient temperature, as well as respiratory virus activities, and the logs of web queries on COPD-related issues. We then assessed the associations between these patient-derived and external factors and COPD exacerbations. Univariate analysis showed that patient factors, air pollution, various types of viruses, temperature, and the number of COPD-related web queries were associated with COPD exacerbation. Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of exacerbations in the preceding year, female sex, COPD grade, and influenza virus detection rate, and lowest temperature showed significant association with exacerbation. Our findings may help COPD patients predict when exacerbations are likely, and provide intervention as early as possible.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jongmin; Jung, Hyun Myung; Kim, Sook Kyung; Yoo, Kwang Ha; Jung, Ki-Suck; Lee, Sang Haak; Rhee, Chin Kook","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/359417eec03774de55b638845646f0f377f35de8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6491439.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43167-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","Health Insurance Review","Assessment Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","COPD exacerbations","number of COPD","COPD grade","COPD-related issues","patient factors","COPD assessment test scores","Korean COPD subgroup study","external factors","exacerbating factors","number of exacerbations","integrated analysis of patient","lowest temperature","Assessment Service data","related web queries","Univariate analysis","Multivariate analysis","logs of web queries","daily minimum ambient temperature","respiratory virus activities","influenza virus detection rate","patients\u2019 Korean Health Insurance Review","microns","diameter","lung function","air pollution","preceding year","various types of viruses","female sex","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","levels of particulate matter","KOCOSS","smoking status","significant association","primary weather variables","identification","intervention","date","findings","associations"],"language":"en"},

Using a microarray, we identified differential regulation of several host genes upon ectopic expression of A3G. One of the up-regulated genes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein retention receptor KDELR2, reduced MV replication ~5 fold when it was over-expressed individually in Vero and CEM-SS T cells. Silencing of KDELR2 in A3G-expressing Vero cells abrogated the antiviral activity induced by A3G, confirming its role as an A3G-regulated antiviral host factor. Recognition of the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif by KDEL receptors initiates the retrograde transport of soluble proteins that have escaped the ER and play an important role in ER quality control. Although KDELR2 over-expression reduced MV titers in cell cultures, we observed no interaction between KDELR2 and the MV hemagglutinin (H) protein. Instead, KDELR2 retained chaperones in the ER, which are required for the correct folding and transport of the MV envelope glycoproteins H and fusion protein (F) to the cell surface. Our data indicate that KDELR2 competes with MV envelope proteins for binding to calnexin and GRP78/Bip, and that this interaction limits the availability of the chaperones for MV proteins, causing the reduction of virus spread and titers.","publish_time":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiwarekar, Vishakha; Fehrholz, Markus; Schneider-Schaulies, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69718b1722e6fb921fa5c56b5135454ddbdf7457.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6356275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621148/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MV","KDEL"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["MV proteins","MV titers","MV envelope proteins","MV hemagglutinin","reduced MV replication","Silencing of KDELR2","KDELR2 over-expression","MV envelope glycoproteins H","protein retention receptor KDELR2","ectopic expression of A3G","fusion protein","host genes","Vero cells","ER quality control","interaction","regulated genes","chaperones","retrograde transport of soluble proteins","antiviral host factor","KDEL receptors","cell cultures","important role","antiviral activity","cell surface","CEM-SS T cells","endoplasmic reticulum","motif","Glu-Leu","binding","calnexin","Lys-Asp","measles","differential regulation","Bip","GRP78","availability","cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G","reduction of virus","correct folding","microarray","Recognition","data"],"language":"en"},

Supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation. However, at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route. Here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific CD8\u002B T cell responses when delivered intranasally, and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization. Peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase (PA) and the Q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization. Intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific CD8\u002B T cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites. The CD8\u002B T cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce IFN-\u03B3 ex vivo, lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo, and diminish viral loads in infected mice. Compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers, intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory CD8\u002B T cells in the lung, allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination. These results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering CD8\u002B epitopes without adjuvant or CD4\u002B epitopes, are non-inflammatory, and promote more lung-resident memory CD8\u002B T cells compared to subcutaneous immunization.","publish_time":"2018-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Youhui; Wen, Yi; Kelly, Sean H.; Chong, Anita S.; Collier, Joel H.","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c9ed521df2b35827b6cfa448e5b790effeee400.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6309200.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365918302165; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365918302165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673645/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Intranasally","Supramolecular peptide nanofibers","self-assembled peptide nanofibers","T cell responses","influenza peptide epitope","lung-resident memory CD8","greater antigen-specific CD8","dendritic cells","epitope-pulsed target cells","immune responses","intranasal immunization","number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory CD8","Q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers","epitopes","subcutaneous immunizations","materials","Abstract Influenza vaccines","mediastinal lymph nodes","influenza acid polymerase","non-inflammatory character","delivery sites","intranasal route","needle-free delivery routes","injected formulations","potential advantages","terms of patient compliance","cost","CD4","absence of exogenous adjuvants","infection","viral loads","ability","weeks post-vaccination","rapid response","IFN-\u03B3 ex","extent","ease of global distribution","measurable inflammation","infected mice","Peptides","platforms","immunotherapies","results","immunogenicity","present"],"language":"en"},

Results Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308). Conclusion In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiong; Tan, Li; Wang, Xu; Liu, Weiyong; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43ac7ec86eccded333b71af61147f4e1c92a58c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315809/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302356?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["nasopharyngeal swabs","oropharyngeal swabs","Higher positive rate","positive tests","inpatients","outpatients","false negative results","total tests","stage of COVID","Conclusion","negative RT-PCR test results","respiratory tract specimens","late stage of hospitalization","outbreak of coronavirus disease","female","evaluation of discharge","study","performance","Abstract Background","medical record","confirmed cases","common sample","Kappa","consistency","median age","years","China","Methods","Wuhan","Detection","women"],"language":"en"},

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host\u2019s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","publish_time":"2015-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Sharma, Supriya; Krajacich, Benjamin J.; Fakoli III, Lawrence S.; Bolay, Fatorma K.; Diclaro II, Joe W.; Johnson, W.

After 12 years follow-up of a cohort of 13 long-term non-progressors (LTNP) identified from 135 individuals with transfusion-acquired HIV infection, 5 remained LTNP after 23 to 26 years infection, but only 3 retained elite LTNP status. We examined the mechanisms that differentiated delayed progressors from LTNP in this cohort. RESULTS: A survival advantage was conferred on 12 of 13 subjects, who had at least one host genetic factor (HLA, chemokine receptor or TLR polymorphisms) or viral attenuating factor (defective nef) associated with slow progression. However, antiviral immune responses differentiated the course of disease into and beyond the second decade of infection. A stable p24-specific proliferative response was associated with control of viraemia and retention of non-progressor status, but this p24 response was absent or declined in viraemic subjects. Strong Gag-dominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were identified in most LTNP, or Pol dominant-CTL in those with nef-defective HIV infection. CTL were associated with control of viraemia when combined with p24 proliferative responses. However, CTL did not prevent late disease progression. Individuals with sustained viral suppression had CTL recognising numerous Gag epitopes, while strong but restricted responses to one or two immunodominant epitopes was effective for some time, but failed to contain viraemia over the course of this study. Viral escape mutants at a HLA B27-restricted Gag-p24 epitope were detected in only 1 of 3 individuals, whereas declining or negative p24 proliferative responses occurred in all 3 concurrent with an increase in viraemia. CONCLUSION: Detectable viraemia at study entry was predictive of loss of LTNP status and/or disease progression in 6 of 8, and differentiated slow progressors from elite LTNP who retained potent virological control. Sustained immunological suppression of viraemia was independently associated with preserved p24 proliferative responses, regardless of the strength and breadth of the CTL response. A decline in this protective p24 response preceded or correlated with loss of non-progressor status and/or signs of disease progression.","publish_time":"2008-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dyer, Wayne B; Zaunders, John J; Yuan, Fang Fang; Wang, Bin; Learmont, Jennifer C; Geczy, Andrew F; Saksena, Nitin K; McPhee, Dale A; Gorry, Paul R; Sullivan, John S","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27bafe2069fadba9638ec9eb5ae1afaf3c78cfb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2633348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19077215/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-5-112","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol"],"organizations":["LTNP","TLR","CTL","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTL response","elite LTNP status","negative p24 proliferative responses","preserved p24 proliferative responses","control of viraemia","restricted responses","remained LTNP","protective p24 response","Elite non-progressors","Detectable viraemia","stable p24-specific proliferative response","long-term non-progressors","loss of non-progressor status","Pol dominant-CTL","immunological suppression of viraemia","slow progressors","signs of disease progression","course of disease","late disease progression","years infection","slow progression","retention of non-progressor status","nef-defective HIV infection","HLA B27-restricted Gag-p24 epitope","sustained viral suppression","antiviral immune responses","delayed progressors","infected individuals","decade of infection","viral attenuating factor","plasma viral load","numerous Gag epitopes","Viral escape mutants","defective nef","cohort","Strong Gag-dominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte","tiny fraction of HIV","potent virological control","predictive of loss","immunodominant epitopes","study entry","years follow-up","viraemic subjects","host genetic factor","chemokine receptor","TLR polymorphisms","copies","strength","time","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","breadth","decline","mechanisms","transfusion","RESULTS","survival advantage","increase"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load \u003E2 \u00D7 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load \u003E10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood and there is little information available on any aspect of antiviral immunity in bats. Massively parallel sequencing of the bat transcriptome provides the opportunity for rapid gene discovery. Although the genomes of one megabat and one microbat have now been sequenced to low coverage, no transcriptomic datasets have been reported from any bat species. In this study, we describe the immune transcriptome of the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing an important resource for identification of genes involved in a range of activities including antiviral immunity. RESULTS: Towards understanding the adaptations that have allowed bats to coexist with viruses, we have de novo assembled transcriptome sequence from immune tissues and stimulated cells from P. alecto. We identified about 18,600 genes involved in a broad range of activities with the most highly expressed genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, enzyme activity, cellular components and metabolism and energy pathways. 3.5% of the bat transcribed genes corresponded to immune genes and a total of about 500 immune genes were identified, providing an overview of both innate and adaptive immunity. A small proportion of transcripts found no match with annotated sequences in any of the public databases and may represent bat-specific transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first reported bat transcriptome dataset and provides a survey of expressed bat genes that complement existing bat genomic data. In addition, these data provide insight into genes relevant to the antiviral responses of bats, and form a basis for examining the roles of these molecules in immune response to viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papenfuss, Anthony T; Baker, Michelle L; Feng, Zhi-Ping; Tachedjian, Mary; Crameri, Gary; Cowled, Chris; Ng, Justin; Janardhana, Vijaya; Field, Hume E; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea2edcf3b251f6a0bc4d4c36aefe9fa91655a70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3436859.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune genes","bat transcribed genes","expressed genes","immune transcriptome","genes relevant","survey of expressed bat genes","identification of genes","bat species","reported bat transcriptome dataset","bat-specific transcripts","immune tissues","immune response","antiviral responses of bats","existing bat genomic data","Ebola viruses","re-emerging viruses","Rabies viruses","aspect of antiviral immunity","range of emerging","broad range of activities","adaptive immunity","study","novo assembled transcriptome sequence","Pteropus alecto","viral infection","control of viral replication","small proportion of transcripts","cellular components","enzyme activity","maintenance","metabolism","cell growth","SARS","Australian flying fox","stimulated cells","natural reservoir host","match","molecules","important resource","henipaviruses","coronaviruses","opportunity","insight","annotated sequences","energy pathways","little information available","rapid gene discovery","roles","public databases","overview","total","low coverage","mechanisms responsible","transcriptomic datasets","microbat","BACKGROUND","parallel sequencing","genomes","megabat","addition","adaptations","basis","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This study provides information on the survivability of PEDV across common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of the liquid antimicrobial. RESULTS: Eighteen ingredients commonly included in commercial swine diets were selected, including 3 grain sources (corn, soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)), 5 porcine by-products (spray-dried plasma, purified plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal and red blood cells (RBCs)), 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) mixes (sow, nursery, finishing), 2 fat sources (choice white grease and soy oil), 3 synthetic amino acids (lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine), as well as limestone and dry choline chloride. Complete feed and stock PEDV served as controls. Thirty grams of each ingredient were inoculated with 2 mL PEDV. A matched set of samples were treated with the formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB\u00AE (LA). All samples (n = 320) were stored outdoors under winter time ambient conditions for 30 days. Samples were submitted on 1, 7, 14 and 30 days post-inoculation (DPI) and tested by PCR and virus isolation (VI). All VI-negative samples were tested by swine bioassay. Viable PEDV was detected by VI or swine bioassay at 1, 7, 14 and 30 DPI from SBM, DDGS, meat \u0026 bone meal, RBCs, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choice white grease, choline chloride, complete feed and stock virus control and at 7 DPI in limestone and at 14 DPI in threonine. Supplementary testing of complete feed and SBM indicated viable virus out to 45 and 180 DPI, respectively. All other samples were negative by VI and bioassay. In contrast, treatment with LA inactivated PEDV across all ingredients on 1 DPI and induced RNA reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, PEDV viability in feed was influenced by ingredient with extended survival in SBM. Furthermore, LA treatment rendered virus inactive, independent of ingredient type.","publish_time":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dee, Scott; Neill, Casey; Clement, Travis; Singrey, Aaron; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35b51eaf2cbbb07dd83420b7185215a2f9467709.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382523.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405416/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-015-0003-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCL","SBM","LA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stock PEDV","Viable PEDV","SBM","PEDV introduction","survivability of PEDV","PEDV viability","inactivated PEDV","Contaminated complete feed","common swine feed ingredients","swine bioassay","negative samples","Supplementary testing of complete feed","viable virus","bone meal","porcine plasma","virus inactive","virus isolation","stock virus control","liquid antimicrobial SalCURB","matched set of samples","soybean meal","spray-dried plasma","choice white grease","lysine HCL","meat","RBCs","methionine","DDGS","commercial swine diets","limestone","treatment","study","threonine","dry choline chloride","independent of ingredient type","porcine by-products","fat sources","risk factors","grain sources","winter time ambient conditions","dried distillers grains","days post-inoculation","soy oil","presence","synthetic amino acids","intestinal mucosa","VTM","mixes","farms","red blood cells","sow","nursery","finishing","corn","absence","trace mineral","vitamin","solubles","formaldehyde","BACKGROUND","induced RNA reduction","extended survival","contrast","information","controls","PCR","CONCLUSIONS","grams","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [\u00B1 SD] age, 52.8 \u00B1 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 \u00B1 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 \u00B1 3.8) and lower (4.5 \u00B1 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 \u00B1 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 \u00B1 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (\u2264 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming","journal":"AJR.

The aim of this study was to determine calf, herd, and within-herd Cryptosporidium prevalence and identify Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in calves with diarrhea in intensive dairy herds in central Argentina. A total of 1073 fecal samples were collected from 54 randomly selected dairy herds. Cryptosporidium-oocysts were isolated and concentrated from fecal samples using formol-ether and detected by light microscopy with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique. Overall prevalence of oocyst-excreting calves was found to be 25.5% (274/1073) (95% C.I. 22.9; 28.1%). Of the herds studied, 89% (48/54) included at least one infected calf, whereas within-herd prevalence ranged from the absence of infection to 57% (20/35). A highly significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and C. parvum infection (\u03C7(2) = 55.89, p \u003C 0.001). For species determination, genomic DNA isolated from oocyst-positive fecal samples was subjected to PCR-RFLP of the 18S rRNA gene resulting exclusively in Cryptosporidium parvum identification. C. parvum isolates of calves displaying diarrhea and high rate of excretion of oocysts were subtyped by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP60) gene. Altogether five GP60 subtypes, designated IIaA18G1R1, IIaA20G1R1, IIaA21G1R1, IIaA22G1R1, and IIaA24G1R1 were identified. Interestingly, IIaA18G1R1 and IIaA20G1R1 were predominant in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity. Notably, IIaA24G1R1 represents a novel, previously unrecognized C. parvum subtype. The subtype IIaA18G1R1, frequently found in this study, is strongly implicated in zoonotic transmission. These results suggest that calves might be an important source for human cryptosporidiosis in Argentina.

There are no available vaccines or therapeutic agents. Previous clinical trials evaluated transmembrane-deleted and point-mutation Ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) in candidate vaccines. Constructs evaluated in this trial encode wild-type (WT) GP from Ebolavirus Zaire and Sudan species and the Marburgvirus Angola strain expressed in a DNA vaccine. METHODS: The VRC 206 study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of these DNA vaccines (4 mg administered intramuscularly by Biojector) at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with a homologous boost at or after week 32. Safety evaluations included solicited reactogenicity and coagulation parameters. Primary immune assessment was done by means of GP-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The vaccines were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events; 80% of subjects had positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results (\u226530) at week 12. The fourth DNA vaccination boosted the immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: The investigational Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus WT GP DNA vaccines were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in this phase I study. These results will further inform filovirus vaccine research toward a goal of inducing protective immunity by using WT GP antigens in candidate vaccine regimens.

According to previous deletion analyses, M self-assembly involves multiple M sequence regions. To identify important M amino acid residues for VLP assembly, we coexpressed N with multiple M mutants containing substitution mutations at the amino-terminal ectodomain, carboxyl-terminal endodomain, or transmembrane segments. Our results indicate that a dileucine motif in the endodomain tail (218LL219) is required for efficient N packaging into VLPs. Results from cross-linking VLP analyses suggest that the cysteine residues 63, 85 and 158 are not in close proximity to the M dimer interface. We noted a significant reduction in M secretion due to serine replacement for C158, but not for C63 or C85. Further analysis suggests that C158 is involved in M-N interaction. In addition to mutations of the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, substitutions at codons W19, W57, P58, W91, Y94 or F95 all resulted in significantly reduced VLP yields, largely due to defective M secretion. VLP production was not significantly affected by a tryptophan replacement of Y94 or F95 or a phenylalanine replacement of W19, W57 or W91. Combined, these results indicate the involvement of specific M amino acids during SARS-CoV virus assembly, and suggest that aromatic residue retention at specific positions is critical for M function in terms of directing virus assembly.","publish_time":"2013-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Ying-Tzu; Chang, Chia-Hui; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3659117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23700447/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VLP assembly","SARS-CoV virus assembly","results","VLP production","N interaction","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","cross-linking VLP analyses","amino-terminal ectodomain","amino acids","F95","W57","amino acid residues","phenylalanine replacement of W19","serine replacement","tryptophan replacement of Y94","W91","reduced VLP yields","efficient N packaging","secretion","C158","VLPs","carboxyl-terminal endodomain","specific positions","codons W19","involvement of specific","capable of self-assembly","endodomain tail","form of membrane","dileucine motif","substitution mutations","cysteine residues","previous deletion analyses","function","P58","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","aromatic residue retention","release","substitutions","proteins","218LL219","mutants","enveloped vesicles","terms","transmembrane segments","close proximity","dimer interface","SWWSFNPE","sequence regions","significant reduction","C63","addition","particles","C85","analysis"],"language":"en"},

For the overwhelming majority, their causative agents are RNA viruses which include but are not limited to HIV, Influenza, SARS, Ebola, Dengue, and Hantavirus. Of increasing importance therefore is a better understanding of global viral diversity to enable better surveillance and prediction of pandemic threats; this will require rapid and flexible methods for complete viral genome sequencing. RESULTS: We have adapted the SISPA methodology [1-3] to genome sequencing of RNA and DNA viruses. We have demonstrated the utility of the method on various types and sources of viruses, obtaining near complete genome sequence of viruses ranging in size from 3,000\u201315,000 kb with a median depth of coverage of 14.33. We used this technique to generate full viral genome sequence in the presence of host contaminants, using viral preparations from cell culture supernatant, allantoic fluid and fecal matter. CONCLUSION: The method described is of great utility in generating whole genome assemblies for viruses with little or no available sequence information, viruses from greatly divergent families, previously uncharacterized viruses, or to more fully describe mixed viral infections.","publish_time":"2008-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Djikeng, Appolinaire; Halpin, Rebecca; Kuzmickas, Ryan; DePasse, Jay; Feldblyum, Jeremy; Sengamalay, Naomi; Afonso, Claudio; Zhang, Xinsheng; Anderson, Norman G; Ghedin, Elodie; Spiro, David J","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06795e24716acde6e56c25d7845c92a97fa0268c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2254600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18179705/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hantavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","viral genome sequence","complete genome sequence of viruses","sources of viruses","DNA viruses","uncharacterized viruses","complete viral genome sequencing","viral preparations","genome assemblies","genome sequencing of RNA","mixed viral infections","better understanding of global viral diversity","available sequence information","better surveillance","great utility","emerging health threats","prediction of pandemic threats","cell culture supernatant","allantoic fluid","presence of host contaminants","flexible methods","divergent families","Ebola","causative agents","various types","fecal matter","Dengue","Influenza","SARS","zoonotic origin","overwhelming majority","HIV","BACKGROUND","increasing importance","technique","size","median depth of coverage","Hantavirus","SISPA methodology","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Peste des petits ruminants virus dampens host interferon-based signaling pathways through multiple mechanisms. Previous studies deciphered the role of V and C in abrogating IFN-\u03B2 production. Moreover, V protein directly interacted with signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 resulting in the impairment of host IFN responses. In our present study, PPRV infection inhibited both IFN-\u03B2- and IFN-\u03B3-induced activation of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and IFN-\u03B3-activated site (GAS) element, respectively. Both N and P proteins, functioning as novel IFN response antagonists, markedly suppressed IFN-\u03B2-induced ISRE and IFN-\u03B3-induced GAS promoter activation to impair downstream upregulation of various interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and prevent STAT1 nuclear translocation. Specifically, P protein interacted with STAT1 and subsequently inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas N protein neither interacted with STAT1 nor inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation as well as dimerization, suggesting that the N and P protein antagonistic effects were different. Though they differed in their relationship to STAT1, both proteins blocked JAK-STAT signaling, severely negating the host antiviral immune response. Our study revealed a new mechanism employed by PPRV to evade host innate immune response, providing a platform to study the interaction of paramyxoviruses and host response.","publish_time":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Pengfei; Zhu, Zixiang; Zhang, Xiangle; Dang, Wen; Li, Linlin; Du, Xiaoli; Zhang, Miaotao; Wu, Chunyan; Xue, Qinghong; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue; Nan, Yuchen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e7aa7140ee7e3c82c78c1aa4cf0cb2583e8d9bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6669484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288481/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11070629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","PPRV","N and P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B3","host response","induced activation of IFN","suppressed IFN-\u03B2","novel IFN response antagonists","impairment of host IFN responses","inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation","abrogating IFN-\u03B2 production","host interferon","N protein","host antiviral immune response","stimulated response element","V protein","STAT1 nuclear translocation","petits ruminants virus","induced ISRE","P proteins","P protein antagonistic effects","induced GAS promoter activation","PPRV infection","global peste","present study","role of V","downstream upregulation of various interferon-stimulated genes","proteins blocked JAK-STAT","ISGs","signal transducers","activated site","activators of transcription","severe economic loss","pathways","platform","interaction of paramyxoviruses","STAT2","dimerization","new mechanism","Previous studies","relationship","multiple mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Microglia play key roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis and acting as first responders to infection and inflammation, and peripheral macrophages infiltrate the CNS during neuroinflammation. Due to their distinct origins and functions, discrimination between these cell populations is essential to the comprehension of neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies comparing the gene profiles of microglia and peripheral macrophages, or macrophages in vitro-derived from bone marrow, under non-infectious conditions of the CNS, have revealed valuable microglial-specific genes. However, studies comparing gene profiles between CNS-infiltrating macrophages and microglia, when both are isolated from the CNS during viral-induced neuroinflammation, are lacking. METHODS: We isolated, via flow cytometry, microglia and infiltrating macrophages from the brains of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected C57BL/6 J mice and used RNA-Seq, followed by validation with qPCR, to examine the differential transcriptional profiles of these cells. We utilized primary literature defining subcellular localization to determine whether or not particular proteins extracted from the transcriptional profiles were expressed at the cell surface. The surface expression and cellular specificity of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) protein were examined via flow cytometry. We also examined the immune response gene profile within the transcriptional profiles of these isolated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. RESULTS: We have identified and validated new microglial- and macrophage-specific genes, encoding cell surface proteins, expressed at the peak of neuroinflammation. TREM-1 protein was confirmed to be expressed by infiltrating macrophages, not microglia, at the peak of neuroinflammation. We also identified both unique and redundant immune functions, through examination of the immune response gene profiles, of microglia and infiltrating macrophages during neurotropic viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of cell surface-specific genes during neuroinflammation can potentially be used to discriminate between microglia and macrophages as well as provide a resource that can be further utilized to target and manipulate specific cell responses during neuroinflammation.

This study was conducted to evaluate the function of tumor-suppressive LINC01197 in PDAC progression and investigate the detailed mechanisms. METHODS: LncRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in FOXO1-overexpressing PANC1 cells. LINC01197 expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to analyze the prognostic role of LNC01197 in PDAC. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between LNC01197 and FOXO1. The biological function of LINC01197 was evaluated by colony formation assay in vitro and in an animal subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment and Ki67 staining in vivo. RNA-pulldown, western blotting, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and co-immunoprecipitation were further performed to determine the molecular mechanism of LNC01197 and \u03B2-catenin in the Wnt pathway. RESULTS: We found that a FOXO1-related lncRNA, LINC01197, was significantly decreased in PDAC malignant tissues and that its low expression predicted poor prognosis. Moreover, LINC01197 was mainly localized in the nucleus and inhibited PDAC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01197 was found to bind to \u03B2-catenin and inhibit Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling activity by disrupting \u03B2-catenin binding to TCF4 in PDAC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The novel FOXO1/LINC01197/\u03B2-catenin axis was dysregulated during PDAC progression. Our study provides insight into the mechanisms of LINC01197 in PDAC and reveal a potential target for PDAC clinical therapy and prognostic prediction.","publish_time":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Jing; Wang, Fan; Liu, Chuan; Dong, Xiao; Xue, Ying; Jia, Xuebing; Song, Weifeng; Li, Qi","journal":"J Exp Clin Cancer Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9d015b725d247948462394085053cff02c94791.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6485178.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-019-1174-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027497/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cancer Genome Atlas","PDAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDAC progression","PDAC cells","LINC01197 expression","suppressive LINC01197","mechanisms of LINC01197","PDAC clinical therapy","PDAC malignant tissues","\u03B2-catenin binding","\u03B2-catenin axis","biological function of LINC01197","inhibited PDAC cell proliferation","novel FOXO1","RNA immunoprecipitation assay","tumor-suppressive lncRNAs","FOXO1-related lncRNA","FOXO1-overexpressing PANC1 cells","function of tumor","prognostic role of LNC01197","study","colony formation assay","luciferase reporter assay","molecular mechanism of LNC01197","western blotting","Northern blotting","RNA-pulldown","co-immunoprecipitation","low expression","prognostic prediction","Wnt pathway","detailed mechanisms","LncRNA microarray","numerous oncogenic long non-coding RNAs","pivotal roles","pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","animal subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment","potential target","activity","quantitative PCR","Ki67 staining","fluorescence","nucleus","TCF4","Recent studies","situ hybridization","Cancer Genome Atlas database","poor prognosis","CONCLUSIONS","insight","interaction","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005\u20132015 in China. METHODS: We used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups. RESULTS: A total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005\u20132015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratory-confirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P \u003C 0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011\u20132015 (P \u003E 0.05). During 2005\u20132015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10\u201319 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005\u20132015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P \u003C 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011\u20132015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.

Rumors identified and confirmed by the authorities were collected from Baidu search engine. RESULTS: Both daily posted and forwarded number and BAI for keyword H7N9 increased quickly during the first 3 days of the outbreaks and remained at a high level for 5 days. The total daily posted and forwarded number for H7N9 on Sina microblog peaked at 850,000 on April 3, from zero blogs before March 31, increasing to 97,726 on April 1 and to 370,607 on April 2, and remaining above 500,000 from April 5-8 before declining to 208,524 on April 12. The total daily BAI showed a similar pattern of change to the total daily posted and forwarded number over time from March 31 to April 12. When the outbreak locations spread, especially into other areas of the same province/city and the capital, Beijing, daily posted and forwarded number and BAI increased again to a peak at 368,500 and 116,911, respectively. The median daily BAI during the studied 25 days was significantly higher among the 7 provinces/cities with reported human H7N9 cases than the 2 provinces without any cases (P\u003C.001). So were the median daily posted and forwarded number and daily BAI in each province/city except Anhui province. We retrieved a total of 32 confirmed rumors spread across 19 provinces/cities in China. In all, 84% (27/32) of rumors were disseminated and transmitted by social media. CONCLUSIONS: The first 3 days of an epidemic is a critical period for the authorities to take appropriate action through Internet surveillance to prevent and control the epidemic, including preparation of personnel, technology, and other resources; information release; collection of public opinion and reaction; and clarification, prevention, and control of rumors. Internet surveillance can be used as an efficient and economical tool to prevent and control public health emergencies, such as H7N9 outbreaks.","publish_time":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Hua; Chen, Bin; Zhu, Honghong; Jiang, Tao; Wang, Xinyi; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Zhenggang; Zheng, Dawei; Jiang, Jianmin","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3906895.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Family Planning Committee","Baidu","BAI"],"locations":["China","Anhui"],"keyphrases":["total daily BAI","human H7N9 outbreaks","median daily BAI","keyword H7N9","forwarded number of blogs","H7N9 virus","control of rumors","reported human H7N9 cases","daily Baidu Attention Index","days","Outbreaks of human infection","Baidu website","public attention","prevention","public reaction","provinces","control public health emergencies","confirmed rumors","social media","new human infectious disease outbreak","Sina microblog website","potential roles of Internet surveillance","collection of public opinion","China National Health","authorities","city","cities","social impact","Anhui province","epidemic","outbreak locations","Baidu search engine","Family Planning Committee website","new avian influenza","information release","resources","similar pattern of change","clarification","Official data","appropriate action","economical tool","technology","critical period","Beijing","preparation of personnel","study","METHODS","areas","capital","high level","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","spring","time","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","peak"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Clinical specimens, including throat swabs, sputum or tracheal aspirates, etc., were obtained from patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILIs), especially from those having pneumonia and a history of occupational exposure to poultry and wild birds. RNA was extracted from these samples and a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to specifically detect the influenza A virus (FluA). PCR primers targeted the conserved M and Rnase P (RP) genes, as well as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the H7N9 virus. RESULTS: The multiplex assay specifically detected the avian H7N9 virus, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory pathogens was observed. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 0.05 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)), or 100 copies per reaction. Positive detection of the H7N9 virus in sputum/tracheal aspirates was higher than in throat swabs during the surveillance of patients with ILIs. Additionally, detection of the matrix (M) and Rnase P genes aided in the determination of the novel avian H7N9 virus and ensured the quality of the clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the multiplex assay detected the novel avian H7N9 virus with high specificity and sensitivity, which is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients.

Samples and methods Serial HRCT scans in 39 patients with pneumonia complicating novel influenza A (H1N1) were reviewed for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities as well as distribution and extent of involvement. Longitudinal changes were assessed at different time points. Results In the early stage, the most common HRCT finding was patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 4, 54.7%). In the progressive stage, bilaterally distributed GGO mixed with consolidation was the most commonly observed feature (n = 28, 71.8%). The diffuse pattern deteriorated to a peak (n = 17, 43.6%) at this stage. In the convalescent stage, the most common finding was fibrosis (n = 25, 64.1%). Averagely, fibrosis was observed at d 18.5 \u00B1 6.4 after the onset of symptoms. Three patterns of longitudinal changes of the lesions were observed, including: type 1, improvement after deterioration; type 2, concurrent improvement and deterioration followed by improvement; and type 3, gradual improvement. Type 1 was the more common pattern (n = 27, 69.2%). Complete serial HRCT scans from initial and final scan were obtained in 24 patients, and the mean CT score peaked at d 8\u201314 of the illness. Conclusion HRCT may play a role in detecting and characterizing pulmonary lesions for the cases of pneumonia complicating influenza A. In addition, it may contribute to monitoring longitudinal changes of pneumonia and assessing therapeutic response.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Feng; Xia, Ganlin; Shi, Yuxin; Zhang, Zhiyong","journal":"Radiology of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0eacf5a5efb058e5b4e8bb6adf1416ceccb8da1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104186.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352621115000352; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352621115000352; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2015.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GGO","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type","common HRCT finding","longitudinal changes of pneumonia","patients","Conclusion HRCT","early stage","progressive stage","methods Serial HRCT scans","Complete serial HRCT scans","patterns of longitudinal changes","common finding","cases of pneumonia","lung lesions","novel influenza","concurrent improvement","common pattern","gradual improvement","H1N1","deterioration","pulmonary lesions","fibrosis","observed feature","serial high-resolution computed tomography","distributed GGO","predominant patterns of lung abnormalities","convalescent stages","diffuse pattern","patchy ground-glass opacity","final scan","distribution","consolidation","mean CT score","role","Samples","different time points","Abstract Purpose","therapeutic response","peak","extent of involvement","Results","addition","onset of symptoms","illness"],"language":"en"},

If linked electronically and scanned systematically, the information provided by these technologies could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches. The benefits of earlier outbreak detection are significant, but implementation could be opposed in the absence of a social licence or if ethical and legal concerns are not addressed. METHODS: A three-phase mixed-method Delphi survey with Australian policy-makers, health practitioners and lawyers (n = 44) was conducted to explore areas of consensus and disagreement over (1) key policy and practical issues raised by the introduction of novel communicable disease surveillance programmes; and (2) the most significant and likely risks from using social media content and WGS technologies in epidemiological research and outbreak investigations. RESULTS: Panellists agreed that the integration of social media monitoring and WGS technologies into communicable disease surveillance systems raised significant issues, including impacts on personal privacy, medicolegal risks and the potential for unintended consequences. Notably, their concerns focused on how these technologies should be used, rather than how the data was collected. Panellists held that social media users should expect their posts to be monitored in the interests of public health, but using those platforms to contact identified individuals was controversial. The conditions of appropriate use of pathogen WGS in epidemiological research and investigations was also contentious. Key differences amongst participants included the necessity for consent before testing and data-linkage, thresholds for action, and the legal and ethical importance of harms to individuals and commercial entities. The erosion of public trust was seen as the most significant risk from the systematic use of these technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing communicable disease surveillance with social-media monitoring and pathogen WGS may cause controversy. The challenge is to determine and then codify how these technologies should be used such that the balance between individual risk and community benefit is widely accepted. Participants agreed that clear guidelines for appropriate use that address legal and ethical concerns need to be developed in consultation with relevant experts and the broader Australian public.

Many functional properties of proteins are determined by their participation in protein\u2013protein complexes, in a temporal and/or spatial manner. To resolve the limitation of application in using mouse primary antibodies on archival, multiple formalin-fixed mouse tissue samples, which were collected from experiments requiring high biocontainment, we developed a practical strategic proximity ligation assay (PLA) capable of employing one primary antibody raised in mouse to probe talin\u2013vinculin spatial proximal complex in mouse tissue. We observed an increase of talin\u2013vinculin spatial proximities in the livers of spotted fever Rickettsia australis or Ebola virus-infected mice when compared with mock mice. Furthermore, using EPAC1-knockout mice, we found that deletion of EPAC1 could suppress the formation of spatial proximal complex of talin\u2013vinculin in rickettsial infections.

We found that EBN extract could strongly inhibit infection with influenza viruses in a host range-independent manner when it was hydrolyzed with Pancreatin F. Western blotting assay showed that the EBN extract bound to influenza virus. Furthermore, EBN extract could neutralize the infection of MDCK cells with influenza viruses and inhibit hemagglutination of influenza viruses to erythrocytes, but it could not inhibit the activity of influenza virus sialidase. Fluorometric HPLC indicated that the major molecular species of sialic acid in EBN is N-acetylneuraminic acid.

The World Health Organization (WHO) prioritised 17 NTDs for control and elimination by 2020 and defined a Road Map to help countries reach these goals. Improved diagnostics for NTDs are essential for guiding treatment strategies at different thresholds of control, interruption of transmission, elimination and post-elimination surveillance. While substantial progress has been made in the last decade with chemotherapy, the same cannot be said of diagnostics, largely due to the perceived lack of a commercially viable market for NTD diagnostics. New sample in-answer out nucleic acid amplification technologies that can be performed at the point-of-care offer improved performance over current technologies and the potential to test for multiple pathogens using a single specimen. Finding commonalities for different NTDs in terms of geographic overlap, sentinel populations and treatment strategy will allow NTD programs to leverage these innovations to build cost-effective multiplex surveillance platforms. Connectivity solutions linking data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers/devices provide opportunities for automated surveillance systems to make health systems more efficient, improving patient outcomes and assessing impact of interventions in real time.

In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected. For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amariles, Pedro; Granados, Johan; Ceballos, Mauricio; Montoya, Carlos Julio","journal":"Res Social Adm Pharm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64905c9eeababdc0e26ccf4e970e119c929d5f20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118674.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120302874; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120302874; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain","Colombia"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Colombia","case of Italy","Mediterranean European countries","spread of SARS","percentage of patients","case fatality rates","Spain","European Mediterranean","Latin American countries","needs of patients","weeks","frequent exposure","different endpoints","higher epidemiological exposure","viral respiratory infections","years","risk","information","COVID","people","tropical zone","individuals older","limited capacity","population","climatic conditions","location","preventive measures","new coronavirus","health system","rules","national government","concern","mortality","situation","country","average data","intensive care","number of deaths","implementation","pandemic","Table","dimension","estimates","differences"],"language":"en"},

The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods. Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice. Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period. Following infection with 104 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10\u201315 HPI. Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5\u20138 HPI. The appearance of diarrheal symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated. The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 \u00D7 102 PFU/mouse of BRV and 1 \u00D7 101 PFU/mouse of MRV. On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model. The model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies. This work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model.","publish_time":"1989-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ijaz, M.

Parameterizing an age-structured epidemic model using published estimates of the pandemic H1N1-2009 and accounting for the cost effectiveness, we examined if the timing and length of school closure could be optimized. METHODS: Age-structured renewal equation was employed to describe the epidemic dynamics of an influenza pandemic. School closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic, abruptly reducing child-to-child transmission for a fixed length of time and also influencing the transmission between children and adults. Public health effectiveness was measured by reduction in the cumulative incidence, and cost effectiveness was also examined by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and adopting a threshold of 1.0 \u00D7 10(7) Japanese Yen/life-year. RESULTS: School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size, while the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility. As the length of school closure was extended, we observed larger reduction in the cumulative incidence. Nevertheless, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of our school closure scenario with the parameters derived from H1N1-2009 was not justifiable. If the risk of death is three times or greater than that of H1N1-2009, the school closure could be regarded as cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: There is no fixed timing and duration of school closure that can be recommended as universal guideline for different types of influenza viruses. The effectiveness of school closure depends on the transmission dynamics of a particular influenza virus strain, especially the virulence (i.e. the infection fatality risk).","publish_time":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Ejima, Keisuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Nakaoka, Shinji; Inaba, Hisashi; Imoto, Seiya; Yamaguchi, Rui; Saito, Masaya M","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b010b3bb7db4f358b0ec2829523ccbfd6d52afbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3901768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447310/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-11-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of school closure","length of school closure","school closure scenario","duration of school closure","cost effectiveness analysis","incremental cost effectiveness ratio","influenza pandemic","epidemic dynamics","pandemic H1N1","Public health effectiveness","time of epidemic peak","transmission dynamics","child transmission","fixed length of time","age-structured epidemic model","fixed timing","largest reduction","substantial influenza transmissions","larger reduction","cumulative incidence","particular influenza virus strain","different types of influenza viruses","published estimates","published opinions","Age-structured renewal equation","risk of death","infection fatality risk","virulence","universal guideline","final size","METHODS","times","variation","parameters","accounting","Japanese Yen","life-year","schools","threshold","place","RESULTS","course","children","adults","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","transmissibility"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S co-expressing VP7 protein of PoRV and S protein of PEDV was constructed.

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Robin N.","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073840.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32054124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","South Korea","Thailand","Japan"],"keyphrases":["sustained human","imported case","human transmission outside of China","limited human","risk of sustained transmission","probability","countries","current outbreak","hospitalisation","symptom onset","patients","ongoing outbreak","outbreak of pneumonia","credible interval","nCoV","SARS coronavirus","importance of current surveillance efforts","intense surveillance","Thailand","South Korea","Japan","world","times","mean time","USA","confirmed cases","Data","Wuhan","assumptions","estimate","global pandemic","deaths"],"language":"en"},

One unintended consequence has been the emergence and spread of transboundary animal diseases and, more specifically, the resurgence and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Concurrent with changes in the livestock sector, contact with wildlife has increased. This development has increased the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to human beings and livestock. Two overarching questions arise with respect to the real and perceived threat from emerging infectious diseases: why are these problems arising with increasing frequency, and how should we manage and control them? A clear conceptual research framework can provide a guide to ensure a research strategy that coherently links to the overarching goals of policy makers. We propose such a new framework in support of a research and policy-generation strategy to help to address the challenges posed by emerging zoonoses.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coker, Richard; Rushton, Jonathan; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Karimuribo, Esron; Lutumba, Pascal; Kambarage, Dominic; Pfeiffer, Dirk U; St\u00E4rk, Katharina; Rweyemamu, Mark","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfed6be64aa1e2c1b0824ad3e3ff857a28465284.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129889.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376670/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309910703121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309910703121; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(10)70312-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["livestock sector","livestock products","research strategy","emerging infectious diseases","wildlife","transboundary animal diseases","emergence of zoonotic diseases","clear conceptual research framework","policy-generation strategy","increasing frequency","new framework","overarching goals of policy makers","emerging zoonoses","overarching questions","globalised world\u0027s increasing demand","expansion of intensive animal production systems","trade","perceived threat","infections","respect","guide","risk of transmission","human beings","decades","problems","growing realisation","support","process of change","challenges","resurgence","changes","Summary","development","unintended consequence"],"language":"en"},

In those studies, RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory tract infections than RV species A and B. In this study we determined the frequency and diversity of RV strains associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI) in Mexico, and describe the clinical characteristics of the illness associated with different RV species. METHODS: A prospective surveillance of 526 and 250 children with URTI and LRTI was carried out. Respiratory samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for viruses. The 5\u2032 untranslated region of the RV genome was amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In the case of URTI, 17.5% were positive for RV, while this virus was found in 24.8% of LRTI. The RV species was determined in 73 children with URTI: 61.6% were RV-A, 37% RV-C and, 1.4% RV-B; and in 43 children with LRTI: 51.2% were RV-A, 41.8% RV-C, and 7% RV-B. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found in patients with RV-A or RV-C infections. A high genetic diversity of RV strains was found in both URTI and LRTI. CONCLUSIONS: Both RV-A and RV-C species were frequently found in hospitalized as well as in outpatient children. This study underlines the high prevalence and genetic diversity of RV strains in Mexico and the potential severity of disease associated with RV-A and RV-C infections.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aponte, Fernando E; Taboada, Blanca; Espinoza, Marco A; Arias-Ortiz, Mar\u00EDa A; Monge-Mart\u00EDnez, Jes\u00FAs; Rodr\u00EDguez-V\u00E1zquez, Rub\u00E9n; D\u00EDaz-Hern\u00E1ndez, Fidel; Z\u00E1rate-Vidal, Fernando; Wong-Chew, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Firo-Reyes, Ver\u00F3nica; del R\u00EDo-Almend\u00E1rez, Carlos N; Gait\u00E1n-Meza, Jes\u00FAs; Villase\u00F1or-Sierra, Alberto; Mart\u00EDnez-Aguilar, Gerardo; Garc\u00EDa-Borjas, Maricela; Noyola, Daniel E; P\u00E9rez-G\u00F3nzalez, Luis F; L\u00F3pez, Susana; Santos-Preciado, Jos\u00E9 I; Arias, Carlos F","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a03e3146304529a94aa7386b10304d4fda9d8d74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0262-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RV","LRTI","URTI"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["RV genome","RV-B","RV-C infections","RV-C species","different RV species","high genetic diversity of RV strains","LRTI","hospitalized children","case of URTI","outpatient children","lower respiratory tract infections","severe respiratory tract infections","Mexico","Respiratory samples","clinical characteristics","study","studies","high prevalence","potential severity of disease","illness","significant differences","frequency","patients","RT-PCR","prospective surveillance","developed countries","untranslated region","incidence of rhinovirus","METHODS","viruses","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The current inability to replicate EEDV in vitro necessitates the search for a reproducible, sensitive, and specific assay that allows for its detection and quantitation in a time- and cost-effective manner. Herein, we describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that was developed for the quantitative detection of EEDV in infected fish tissues. The newly developed LAMP reaction was optimized in the presence of calcein, and the best results were produced using 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM dNTPs and at an incubation temperature of 67.1 \u00B0C. This method was highly specific to EEDV, as it showed no cross-reactivity with several fish viruses, including Salmonid Herpesvirus-1, -2, -4, and -5, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus, Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, Golden Shiner Reovirus, Fathead Minnow Nidovirus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus. The analytical sensitivity of the EEDV-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 16 copies of plasmid per reaction. When infected fish tissue was used, a positive reaction could be obtained when an infected gill tissue sample that contained 430 viral copies/\u03BCg was diluted up to five orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR assay were 84.3% and 93.3%, respectively. The quantitative LAMP for EEDV had a correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.980), and did not differ significantly from the SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay (p \u003E 0.05). Given its cost- and time-effectiveness, this quantitative LAMP assay is suitable for screening lake trout populations and for the initial diagnosis of clinical cases.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingli; Shavalier, Megan; Standish, Isaac; Glenney, Gavin W.; Loch, Thomas P.; Faisal, Mohamed","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/805440d5e0c269e5c488937c6636ab0a2446b979.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119762.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.11.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341830212X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30444983/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341830212X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEDV","Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus","SYBR Green"],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["quantitative LAMP assay","developed LAMP assay","EEDV-LAMP method","quantitative detection of EEDV","specific assay","developed LAMP reaction","SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay","SYBR Green qPCR assay","Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus","Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus","infected fish tissues","Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus","Spring Viremia of Carp Virus","Abstract Epizootic Epitheliotropic Disease Virus","viral copies","fish viruses","Salmonid Herpesvirus","positive reaction","infected gill tissue sample","screening lake trout populations","serious disease hatchery-reared lake trout","time-effectiveness","copies of plasmid","analytical sensitivity","Golden Shiner Reovirus","Fathead Minnow Nidovirus","Salvelinus namaycush","threatening restoration efforts","species","correlation coefficient","initial diagnosis of clinical cases","isothermal amplification","specificity","North America","presence of calcein","cross-reactivity","dNTPs","best results","\u03BCg","quantitation","search","loop","R2","incubation temperature","cost-effective manner","MgCl2","current inability","orders of magnitude"],"language":"en"},

We therefore designed and evaluated a ready-to-use 22 target respiratory infection reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) panel to determine if this would improve detection of these agents at our pediatric hospital. METHODS: RT-qPCR assays for twenty-two target organisms were dried-down in individual wells of 96 well plates and saved at room temperature. Targets included 18 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria. After automated nucleic acid extraction of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples, rapid qPCR was performed. RT-qPCR results were compared with those obtained by the testing methods used at our hospital laboratories. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine pediatric NPA samples were tested with the RT-qPCR panel. One or more respiratory pathogens were detected in 132/159 (83%) samples. This was significantly higher than the detection rate of standard methods (94/159, 59%) (P\u003C0.001). This difference was mainly due to improved RT-qPCR detection of rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, bocavirus, and coronaviruses. The panel internal control assay performance remained stable at room temperature storage over a two-month testing period. CONCLUSION: The RT-qPCR panel was able to identify pathogens in a high proportion of respiratory samples. The panel detected more positive specimens than the methods in use at our hospital. The pre-made panel format was easy to use and rapid, with results available in approximately 90 minutes. We now plan to determine if use of this panel improves patient care and antibiotic stewardship.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellis, Chelsey; Misir, Amita; Hui, Charles; Jabbour, Mona; Barrowman, Nicholas; Langill, Jonathan; Bowes, Jennifer; Slinger, Robert","journal":"World J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af91d9d768f2aee83516cfe29993eacce1be297f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684315/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-015-0069-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-qPCR panel","RT-qPCR results","rapid qPCR","RT-qPCR assays","respiratory viruses","panel format","improved RT-qPCR detection of rhinoviruses","Rapid detection","respiratory pathogens","testing methods","high proportion of respiratory samples","pediatric NPA samples","detection rate of standard methods","pediatric hospital","panel internal control assay performance","parainfluenza viruses","patient care","bacteria","antibiotic stewardship","results available","hospital laboratories","target respiratory infection reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction","wide range of viruses","room temperature storage","target organisms","month testing period","children","nucleic acid extraction of nasopharyngeal aspirate","bocavirus","plates","positive specimens","individual wells","coronaviruses","BACKGROUND","agents","CONCLUSION","minutes","difference","Targets"],"language":"en"},

CAP-associated main pathogens in adults include viruses as well as bacteria. However, large-scale epidemiological investigations of adult viral CAP in China are still lacking. In this study, we analyzed the etiology of adult CAP in Beijing, China and constructed diagnostic models based on combinations of patient clinical factors. METHODS: A multicenter cohort was established with 500 adult CAP outpatients enrolled in Beijing between November 2010 to October 2011. Multiplex and quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR were used to detect 15 respiratory viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Bacteria were detected with culture and enzyme immunoassay of the Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen. Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, discriminatory analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to build predictive models for etiological diagnosis of adult CAP. RESULTS: Pathogens were detected in 54.2% (271/500) of study patients. Viruses accounted for 36.4% (182/500), mycoplasma pneumoniae for 18.0% (90/500) and bacteria for 14.4% (72/500) of the cases. In 182 of the patients with viruses, 219 virus strains were detected, including 166 single and 53 mixed viral infections. Influenza A virus represented the greatest proportion with 42.0% (92/219) and 9.1% (20/219) in single and mixed viral infections, respectively. Factors selected for the predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP included cough, dyspnea, absence of chest pain and white blood cell count (4.0-10.0) \u00D7 10(9)/L, and those of mycoplasma pneumoniae CAP were being younger than 45 years old and the absence of a coexisting disease. However, these models showed low accuracy levels for etiological diagnosis (areas under ROC curve for virus and mycoplasma pneumoniae were both 0.61, P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater consideration should be given to viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in adult CAP outpatients. While predictive etiological diagnostic models of viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae based on combinations of demographic and clinical factors may provide indications of etiology, diagnostic confirmation of CAP remains dependent on laboratory pathogen test results.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ya-Fen; Gao, Yan; Chen, Mei-Fang; Cao, Bin; Yang, Xiao-Hua; Wei, Lai","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d04b1e66045a858dd72847b88dcc6a280da3165.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3728139.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23834931/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["mycoplasma pneumoniae CAP","etiology of adult CAP","adult CAP outpatients","mycoplasma pneumoniae infections","etiological diagnosis of adult","predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP","diagnostic confirmation of CAP","predictive etiological diagnostic models of viral","large-scale epidemiological investigations of adult viral CAP","mixed viral infections","adult community","predictive models","Etiological epidemiology","bacteria","Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen","combinations of patient clinical factors","respiratory viruses","discriminatory analysis","multivariate analysis","Univariate analysis","patient clinical features","Beijing","China","virus strains","main pathogens","study patients","ROC curve","combinations of demographic","indications of etiology","absence of chest pain","laboratory pathogen test results","Receiver","areas","cough","important issues","enzyme immunoassay","dyspnea","white blood cell count","low accuracy levels","Characteristic","curves","adults","quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR","Multiplex","culture","years old","multicenter cohort","Influenza","greatest proportion","Greater consideration","challenge","BACKGROUND","coexisting disease","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","cases"],"language":"en"},

In eukaryotes, regulation of message stability contributes significantly to the control of gene expression and plays a prominent role in the normal physiology of a cell as well as in its response to environmental and pathogenic stresses. Not surprisingly, emerging evidence indicates that there are significant interactions between the eukaryotic RNA turnover machinery and a wide variety of viruses. Interestingly, in many cases viruses have evolved mechanisms not only to evade eradication by these pathways, but also to manipulate them for enhanced viral replication and gene expression. Given our incomplete understanding of how many of these pathways are normally regulated, viruses should be powerful tools to help deconstruct the complex networks and events governing eukaryotic RNA stability.

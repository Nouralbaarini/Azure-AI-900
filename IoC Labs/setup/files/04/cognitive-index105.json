In the last two decades, mortality rates for Indonesian pilgrims ranged between 200\u2013380 deaths per 100,000 pilgrims over the 10-week Hajj period. Reasons for high mortality are not well understood. In 2008, verbal autopsy was introduced to complement routine death certificates to explore cause of death diagnoses. This study presents the patterns and causes of death for Indonesian pilgrims, and compares routine death certificates to verbal autopsy findings. METHODS: Public health surveillance was conducted by Indonesian public health authorities accompanying pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, with daily reporting of hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data from 2008 were analyzed for timing, geographic location and site of death. Percentages for each cause of death category from death certificates were compared to that from verbal autopsy. RESULTS: In 2008, 206,831 Indonesian undertook the Hajj. There were 446 deaths, equivalent to 1,968 deaths per 100,000 pilgrim years. Most pilgrims died in Mecca (68%) and Medinah (24%). There was no statistically discernible difference in the total mortality risk for the two pilgrimage routes (Mecca or Medinah first), but the number of deaths peaked earlier for those traveling to Mecca first (p=0.002). Most deaths were due to cardiovascular (66%) and respiratory (28%) diseases. A greater proportion of deaths were attributed to cardiovascular disease by death certificate compared to the verbal autopsy method (p\u003C0.001). Significantly more deaths had ill-defined cause based on verbal autopsy method (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite pre-departure health screening and other medical services, Indonesian pilgrim mortality rates were very high. Correct classification of cause of death is critical for the development of risk mitigation strategies. Since verbal autopsy classified causes of death differently to death certificates, further studies are needed to assess the method\u2019s utility in this setting.","publish_time":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pane, Masdalina; Imari, Sholah; Alwi, Qomariah; Nyoman Kandun, I; Cook, Alex R.; Samaan, Gina","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a013535d6925d423b5d999a4b2e1ded678e190a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3749149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23991182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["causes of death","site of death","routine death certificates","Indonesian pilgrims","cause of death category","cause of death diagnoses","verbal autopsy method","number of deaths","verbal autopsy findings","Indonesian pilgrim mortality rates","greater proportion of deaths","high mortality","Mecca","Indonesian public health authorities","ill-defined cause","Public health surveillance","total mortality risk","largest single source of pilgrims","Correct classification of cause","Medinah","week Hajj period","pre-departure health screening","pilgrim years","cardiovascular disease","Surveillance data","development of risk mitigation strategies","medical services","Saudi Arabia","pilgrimage routes","daily reporting of hospitalizations","timing","CONCLUSIONS","geographic location","discernible difference","decades","BACKGROUND","METHODS","studies","Percentages","patterns","method\u2019s utility","setting","Reasons","diseases","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Emergence and continuous reporting of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia emphasize the need for surveillance of MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travelers from the Middle East and capacity building of health care providers for disease containment. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control \u0026 Research (IEDCR) under the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family welfare (MoHFW), is responsible for MERS-CoV screening of pilgrims/ travelers returning from the Middle East with respiratory illness as part of its outbreak investigation and surveillance activities. METHODS: Bangladeshi travelers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented with fever and respiratory symptoms were studied over the period from October 2013 to June 2016. Patients with respiratory symptoms that fulfilled the WHO MERS-CoV case algorithm were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses. Beside surveillance, case recognition training was conducted at multiple levels of health care facilities across the country in support of early detection and containment of the disease. RESULTS: Eighty one suspected cases tested by real time PCR resulted in zero detection of MERS-CoV infection. Viral etiology detected in 29.6% of the cases was predominantly influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B infection (22%). Peak testing occurred mostly following the annual Hajj season. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory tract infections in travelers/pilgrims returning to Bangladesh from the Middle East are mainly due to influenza A and influenza B. Though MERS-CoV was not detected in the 81 patients tested, continuous screening and surveillance are essential for early detection of MERS-CoV infection and other respiratory pathogens to prevent transmissions in hospital settings and within communities. Awareness building among healthcare providers will help identify suspected cases.","publish_time":"2018-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muraduzzaman, A. K.

The RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a key sensor of influenza virus RNA that induces the expression of antiviral type I interferons. Recent evidence suggests a complex pattern of RIG-I regulation involving multiple interactions and cellular sites. In an approach employing affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified proteins with increased binding to RIG-I in response to influenza B virus infection. Among them was the RIG-I related RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 6 (DDX6), a known component of cytoplasmic mRNA-ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules like P-bodies and stress granules (SGs). RIG-I and DDX6 both localized to the cytosol and were detected in virus-induced SGs. Coimmunoprecipitation assays detected a basal level of complexes harboring RIG-I and DDX6 that increased after infection. Functionally, DDX6 augmented RIG-I mediated induction of interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 expression. Notably, DDX6 was found to bind viral RNA capable to stimulate RIG-I. These findings imply a novel function for DDX6 as an RNA co-sensor and signaling enhancer for RIG-I.","publish_time":"2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Roc\u00EDo Davi\u00F1a; Budt, Matthias; Saenger, Sandra; Paki, Katharina; Arnold, Ulrike; Sadewasser, Anne; Wolff, Thorsten","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e50c4e4f26f199e6ebc4b2e9298bf1c3ba05d0d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6073104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19071877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RIG-","DDX6 augmented RIG","complex pattern of RIG","key sensor of influenza virus RNA","RNA co-sensor","RNA helicase DEAD box helicase","Virus infections","viral RNA capable","virus-induced SGs","influenza B virus infection","RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene","expression of antiviral type","stress granules","\u03B2 expression","increased binding","sensitive antiviral responses","regulation","quantitative mass spectrometry","mRNP","P-bodies","proteins","known component of cytoplasmic mRNA-ribonucleoprotein","affinity purification","multiple interactions","basal level of complexes","induction of interferon","novel function","approach","cellular sites","IFN","host cell","findings","enhancer","Coimmunoprecipitation assays","Recent evidence","interferons","cytosol"],"language":"en"},

Many of the CoV nonstructural proteins (nsps) are required for RTC function; however, not all of their functions are known. nsp15 contains an endoribonuclease domain that is conserved in the CoV family. While the enzymatic activity and crystal structure of nsp15 are well defined, its role in replication remains elusive. nsp15 localizes to sites of RNA replication, but whether it acts independently or requires additional interactions for its function remains unknown. To begin to address these questions, we created an in situ tagged form of nsp15 using the prototypic CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In MHV, nsp15 contains the genomic RNA packaging signal (P/S), a 95-bp RNA stem-loop structure that is not required for viral replication or nsp15 function. Utilizing this knowledge, we constructed an internal hemagglutinin (HA) tag that replaced the P/S. We found that nsp15-HA was localized to discrete perinuclear puncta and strongly colocalized with nsp8 and nsp12, both well-defined members of the RTC, but not the membrane (M) protein, involved in virus assembly. Finally, we found that nsp15 interacted with RTC-associated proteins nsp8 and nsp12 during infection, and this interaction was RNA independent. From this, we conclude that nsp15 localizes and interacts with CoV proteins in the RTC, suggesting it plays a direct or indirect role in virus replication. Furthermore, the use of in situ epitope tags could be used to determine novel nsp-nsp interactions in coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Athmer, Jeremiah; Fehr, Anthony R.; Grunewald, Matthew; Smith, Everett Clinton; Denison, Mark R.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/634b8c282afdd06201cb2531fb70985d92270271.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5285509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28143984/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02320-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","P/S","RTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp15 function","nsp15-HA","form of nsp15","virus replication","crystal structure of nsp15","CoV proteins","RTC function","sites of RNA replication","viral replication","prototypic CoV","CoV nonstructural proteins","CoV family","RTC-associated proteins nsp8","RNA independent","nsp12","MHV","virus assembly","bp RNA stem-loop structure","genomic RNA packaging signal","novel nsp-nsp interactions","mouse hepatitis virus","transcription complexes","indirect role","additional interactions","situ epitope tags","membranes","infection","endoplasmic reticulum","nsps","close proximity","internal hemagglutinin","discrete perinuclear puncta","coronaviruses","enzymatic activity","well-defined members","endoribonuclease domain","knowledge","questions","functions"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, viruses have developed an impressive diversity of tactics to circumvent IFN responses. Evasion strategies can involve preventing initial virus detection, via the disruption of the Toll\u2010like receptors or the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) \u2010like receptors, or by avoiding the initial production of the ligands recognized by these receptors. An alternative approach is to preclude IFN production by disarming or degrading the transcription factors involved in the expression of IFN, such as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/IRF7, nuclear factor\u2010\u03BAB (NF\u2010\u03BAB), or ATF\u20102/c\u2010jun, or by inducing a general block on host cell transcription. Viruses also oppose IFN signalling, both by disturbing the type I IFN receptor and by impeding JAK/STAT signal transduction upon IFN receptor engagement. In addition, the global expression of IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) can be obstructed via interference with epigenetic signalling, and specific ISGs can also be selectively targeted for inhibition. Finally, some viruses disrupt IFN responses by co\u2010opting negative regulatory systems, whereas others use antiviral mechanisms to their own advantage.

Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). It is not understood whether HCoV-HKU1 S protein has similar activity. In addition, the UPR-activating domain in SARS-CoV S protein remains to be identified. RESULTS: In this study we compared S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 for their ability to activate the UPR. Both S proteins were found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 catalyzed the cleavage of SARS-CoV S protein, but not the counterpart in HCoV-HKU1. Both S proteins showed a similar pattern of UPR-activating activity. Through PERK kinase they activated the transcription of UPR effector genes such as Grp78, Grp94 and CHOP. N-linked glycosylation was not required for the activation of the UPR by S proteins. S1 subunit of SARS-CoV but not its counterpart in HCoV-HKU1 was capable of activating the UPR. A central region (amino acids 201\u2013400) of SARS-CoV S1 was required for this activity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins use distinct UPR-activating domains to exert the same modulatory effects on UPR signaling.","publish_time":"2014-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siu, Kam-Leung; Chan, Ching-Ping; Kok, Kin-Hang; Woo, Patrick C-Y; Jin, Dong-Yan","journal":"Cell Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88395bf2fdca68c0eb033b14655275547bdcd714.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3930072.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2045-3701-4-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","CHOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV S protein","S proteins of SARS","protein of SARS","HCoV-HKU1 S proteins","SARS-CoV S1","cleavage of SARS","distinct UPR","S1 subunit of SARS","similar pattern of UPR","human coronavirus HKU1","transcription of UPR effector genes","similar activity","unfolded protein response","counterpart","severe disease","human populations","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Grp78","domains","Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2","Grp94","BACKGROUND","activation","study","amino acids","central region","milder illness","modulatory effects","ability","Spike","CONCLUSIONS","PERK kinase","endoplasmic reticulum","N-linked glycosylation","CHOP","addition","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of C. perfringens type E from a goat with diarrhea.","publish_time":"2013-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ha-Young; Byun, Jae-Won; Roh, In-Soon; Bae, You-Chan; Lee, Myoung-Heon; Kim, Bumseok; Songer, J.

However, the antigenic properties of this N protein are largely unknown. To facilitate the studies on the function and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV N protein, 6\u00D7 histidine-tagged recombinant SARS-CoV N (rSARS-N) with a molecular mass of 46 and 48kDa was successfully produced using the recombinant baculovirus system in insect cells. The rSARS-N expressed in insect cells (BrSARS-N) showed remarkably higher specificity and immunoreactivity than rSARS-N expressed in E. coli (ErSARS-N). Most of all, BrSARS-N proteins were expressed as a highly phosphorylated form with a molecular mass of 48kDa, but ErSARS-N was a nonphosphorylated protein. In further analysis to determine the correlation between the phosphorylation and the antigenicity of SARS-N protein, dephosphorylated SARS-N protein treated with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) remarkably enhanced the cross-reactivity against SARS negative serum and considerably reduced immunoreactivity with SARS-N mAb. These results suggest that the phosphorylation plays an important role in the immunoreactivity and specificity of SARS-N protein. Therefore, the BrSARS-N protein may be useful for the development of highly sensitive and specific assays to determine SARS infection and for further research of SARS-N pathology.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Gu-Choul; Chung, Yoon-Seok; Kim, In-Soo; Cho, Hae-Wol; Kang, Chun","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/442a2502e0adc13d7dbd25931bffc8db0b5e0c30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114200.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207001074; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207001074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV N protein","SARS-N mAb","dephosphorylated SARS-N protein","ErSARS-N","N pathology","recombinant SARS-CoV N","BrSARS-N proteins","specificity of SARS","antigenicity of SARS","SARS infection","research of SARS","protein phosphatase","nonphosphorylated protein","SARS negative serum","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","reduced immunoreactivity","development","insect cells","molecular mass","kDa","phosphorylation","higher specificity","recombinant baculovirus system","sensitive diagnostic assay","histidine","specific assays","cross-reactivity","important role","key antigen","coli","phosphorylated form","correlation","PP1","pathological reaction","function","antigenic properties","nucleocapsid","studies","analysis","results"],"language":"en"},

Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted during the 2018 winter influenza season. Adult patients with fever/respiratory symptoms (fever/RS group) were age- and sex-matched with patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Respiratory viruses were tested using NxTAG\u2122 Respiratory Pathogen Panel IVD, a commercially-available multiplex PCR panel. Results A total of 214 acutely hospitalized patients were included in the final analysis, consisting of 107 with fever/RS (fever/RS group), and 107 age- and sex-matched patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group). Respiratory viruses were detected in 34.1% (73/214) of patients, and co-infection occurred in 7.9% (17/214) of patients. The incidence of respiratory virus was higher in the fever/RS group than in the non-fever/RS group (44.9% (48/107) versus 23.4% (25/107), p 0.001). Influenza B virus, enterovirus/rhinovirus and coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the fever/RS group, whereas parainfluenza virus 4B and adenovirus were detected more frequently in the non-fever/RS group. Among the non-fever/RS group, chest discomfort was more common among patients tested positive for respiratory viruses than those without respiratory virus detected (44% (11/25) versus 22% (18/82), p 0.04).

Recent efforts to identify cellular factors in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, using genome-wide siRNA screens and other systems biology \u201Comics\u201D methodologies, have revealed several potential anti-viral effectors for viruses like Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus (WNV), and influenza virus.

To gain insight into the host immune mechanisms developed upon PCV2 infection, early innate and adaptive immune responses were examined in 1-week-old, caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets using a subclinical infection model of PCV2 in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a potential immunostimulation factor. The use of LPS did not show any significant effect on the course of PCV2 infection, nor did in the evolution of the immunological parameters evaluated. Ex vivo responses were detected as early as 1 day post-infection (PI) and consisted of an elevation of the plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-8 in PCV2-inoculated pigs followed by an increase on plasmatic IFN-\u03B1 at day 5 PI. Regarding IL-10, only one PCV2-inoculated pig was positive (day 7 PI); this pig was the only one in which viremia persisted until the end of the study. In vitro cytokine determination showed that, regardless of the treatment administrated to the pigs, an IL-10 release was observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures were stimulated with PCV2. Seroconvertion to PCV2 measured by an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) occurred between 7 and 14 days PI, whereas neutralizing antibodies (NA) did not appear until day 29 PI. PCV2 DNA was first detected in serum at day 7 PI, reaching the peak of viremia between days 14 and 21 PI, followed by a drop in viral load that was found coincident with the appearance of PCV2-specific IFN-\u03B3-secreting cells (PCV2-IFN-\u03B3-SC) and NA. Results from the present work suggest that viral clearance might be mediated by the development of PCV2-IFN-\u03B3-SC in contribution to the PCV2-specific NA.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fort, Maria; Fernandes, Lana T.; Nofrarias, Miquel; D\u00EDaz, Ivan; Sibila, Marina; Pujols, Joan; Mateu, Enric; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9c79809f42241166e5b36dba9f266463722025a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127047.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708008106; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.12.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708008106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19167096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2-IFN","PCV2-specific","appearance of PCV2","development of PCV2","PCV2 DNA","course of PCV2 infection","PCV2-inoculated pigs","subclinical infection model of PCV2","days PI","day post-infection","specific IFN-\u03B3","IL","\u03B3-SC","plasmatic IFN-\u03B1","pig immune system","adaptive immune responses","host immune mechanisms","secreting cells","viral clearance","use of LPS","viral load","peak of viremia","plasmatic levels of interleukin","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","PBMC","combination","pathogenesis of postweaning multisystemic","colostrum-deprived piglets","release","lipopolysaccharide","cultures","increase","contribution","significant effect","immunoperoxidase monolayer assay","syndrome","present work","Results","porcine circovirus type","neutralizing antibodies","elevation","serum","determinant event","potential immunostimulation factor","interaction","caesarean","PMWS","IPMA","week-old","insight","evolution","drop","immunological parameters","end","Seroconvertion","cytokine determination","study","Ex","treatment"],"language":"en"},

The respiratory microbiota showed high diversity, related to the young age of the CF cohort (mean age 10 years). Wide inter- and intra-individual variations were revealed. A common core microbiota of 5 phyla and 13 predominant genera was found, the majority of which were obligate anaerobes. A few genera were significantly more prevalent in patients never infected by P. aeruginosa. Persistence of an anaerobic core microbiota regardless of P. aeruginosa status suggests a major role of certain anaerobes in the pathophysiology of lung infections in CF.

Strains of the QX genotype have been major pathogens in poultry flocks in Asia, Europe and other parts of the world. They are the cause of severe problems with kidney disease and reproductive tract disorders. We analysed infectivity and binding properties of the QX strain and compared them with those of the nephropathogenic strain B1648. As most IBV strains do not infect permanent cell lines and show infection only in primary chicken cells of the target organs, we developed a culture system for chicken oviduct explants. The epithelial cells of the oviduct showed a high susceptibility to infection by the QX strain and were almost resistant to infection by the nephropathogenic B1648 strain. Binding tests with isolated primary oviduct epithelial cells and soluble S1 proteins revealed that S1 proteins of two IBV strains bound with the same efficiency to oviduct epithelial cells.

This creates widespread conflict with agriculture and other human interests, but also debate about the role of swans and geese as potential vectors of disease of relevance for human and animal health. Using a One Health perspective, we provide the first comprehensive review of the scientific literature about the most relevant viral, bacterial, and unicellular pathogens occurring in wild geese and swans. Research thus far suggests that these birds may play a role in transmission of avian influenza virus, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, at present there is no evidence that geese and swans play a role in transmission of Newcastle disease, duck plague, West Nile virus, Vibrio, Yersinia, Clostridium, Chlamydophila, and Borrelia. Finally, based on present knowledge it is not possible to say if geese and swans play a role in transmission of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella, Helicobacter, Brachyspira, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Microsporidia. This is largely due to changes in classification and taxonomy, rapid development of identification methods and lack of knowledge about host specificity. Previous research tends to overrate the role of geese and swans as disease vectors; we do not find any evidence that they are significant transmitters to humans or livestock of any of the pathogens considered in this review. Nevertheless, it is wise to keep poultry and livestock separated from small volume waters used by many wild waterfowl, but there is no need to discourage livestock grazing in nature reserves or pastures where geese and swans are present. Under some circumstances it is warranted to discourage swans and geese from using wastewater ponds, drinking water reservoirs, and public beaches. Intensified screening of swans and geese for AIV, West Nile virus and anatid herpesvirus is warranted.","publish_time":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elmberg, Johan; Berg, Charlotte; Lerner, Henrik; Waldenstr\u00F6m, Jonas; Hessel, Rebecca","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb88125e0384bc94499e00b623b18a7d033d0c1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5443079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2017.1300450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28567210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of geese","role of swans","wild geese","livestock","Intensified screening of swans","disease vectors","present knowledge","West Nile virus","transmission of Newcastle disease","transmission of avian influenza virus","potential vectors of disease","wild waterfowl","humans","poultry","evidence","transmission of Escherichia coli","lack of knowledge","unicellular pathogens","human interests","herbivorous waterfowl","comprehensive review","animal health","Health perspective","Previous research","duck plague","Salmonella","Vibrio","AIV","rapid development of identification methods","Helicobacter","taxonomy","Campylobacter","Pasteurella","Yersinia","relevance","pastures","small volume waters","Cryptosporidium","water reservoirs","Brachyspira","scientific literature","Clostridium","wastewater ponds","nature reserves","anatid herpesvirus","Giardia","classification","Chlamydophila","agriculture","significant transmitters","widespread conflict","host specificity","public beaches","changes","antibiotic resistance","need","birds","Microsporidia","Borrelia","hand","circumstances"],"language":"en"},

Methods This study identified SARS-CoV ORF6-interacting proteins using the phage displayed human lung cDNA libraries, and examined the association of ORF6\u2013host factor interaction with Type I IFN antagonism. After the fifth round of biopanning with Escherichia coli-synthesized ORF6-His tagged protein, the relative binding affinity of phage clones to ORF6 was determined using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The highest affinity clone to ORF6 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; also named as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog). The coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the direct binding of ORF6 to the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 in vitro. Confocal imaging revealed a close colocalization of SARS-CoV ORF6 protein with NPIPB3 in human promonocytes. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 attenuated the antagonistic activity of SARS-CoV ORF6 on IFN-\u03B2-induced ISRE (IFN stimulated response element)-responsive firefly luciferase activity. In addition, confocal imaging and Western blotting assays revealed that the increases in STAT-1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation occurred in the transfected cells expressing both genes of ORF6 and NPIPB3, but not in the ORF6-expressing cells in response to IFN-\u03B2. Conclusion The overexpression of NPIPB3 restored the IFN-\u03B2 responses in SARS-CoV ORF6 expressing cells, indicating that the interaction of SARS CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 reduced Type I IFN antagonism by SARS-CoV ORF6.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Su-Hua; Lee, Tzu-Ying; Lin, Ying-Ju; Wan, Lei; Lai, Chih-Ho; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf3c22d1c9c1a4487c7e1356c7b1bbb1b5296117.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105049.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26320399/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2015.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118215008051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118215008051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Escherichia","Confocal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV ORF6","CoV ORF6 protein","interaction of SARS CoV ORF6","association of ORF6","genes of ORF6","direct binding of ORF6","IFN antagonism","Escherichia coli-synthesized ORF6","C-terminal domain of NPIPB3","overexpression of NPIPB3","IFN-\u03B2 responses","antagonistic activity of SARS","close colocalization of SARS","Type","IFN stimulated response element","tagged protein","protein family","proteins","Confocal imaging","transfected cells","coimmunoprecipitation assay","dual luciferase reporter assay","relative binding affinity of phage clones","direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","nuclear translocation","responsive firefly luciferase activity","kinase-related kinase SMG","human promonocytes","nuclear pore complex","host factor interaction","highest affinity clone","human lung cDNA libraries","Purpose Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","induced ISRE","increases","Western blotting assays","Abstract Background","member B3","STAT","phosphorylation","isoform","phosphatidylinositol","round of biopanning","addition","study","interferon","homolog","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This enzyme has been shown to be active as a dimer in which only one protomer is active. However, it remains unknown how the dimer structure maintains an active monomer conformation. It has been observed that the Ser139-Leu141 loop forms a short 3(10)-helix that disrupts the catalytic machinery in the inactive monomer structure. We have tried to disrupt this helical conformation by mutating L141 to T in the stable inactive monomer G11A/R298A/Q299A. The resulting tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/Q299A is indeed enzymatically active as a monomer. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the L141T mutation disrupts the 3(10)-helix and helps to stabilize the active conformation. The coil-3(10)-helix conformational transition of the Ser139-Leu141 loop serves as an enzyme activity switch. Our study therefore indicates that the dimer structure can stabilize the active conformation but is not a required structure in the evolution of the active enzyme, which can also arise through simple mutations.","publish_time":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chunmei; Teng, Xin; Qi, Yifei; Tang, Bo; Shi, Hailing; Ma, Xiaomin; Lai, Luhua","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f7b5b1f4748ede29130df5606fd51f4820edc20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4754693.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879383/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20918","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active conformation","active monomer conformation","active enzyme","dimer structure","inactive monomer structure","required structure","helical conformation","stable inactive monomer G11A","R298A","Ser139-Leu141 loop","Q299A","SARS coronavirus","helix conformational transition","enzyme activity switch","L141T mutation","main proteinase","resulting tetra-mutant G11A","mutating L141","catalytic machinery","evolution","Molecular dynamics simulations","virus life cycle","CLpro","study","protomer","simple mutations","coil"],"language":"en"},

We sought to determine whether allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients would be at higher risk for 60-day mortality. METHODS: We examined a retrospective cohort of adults with HM with or without HCT treated for RSV LRTI (n=154) at our institution from 1996\u20132013. We defined possible RSV LRTI as RSV detected only in the upper respiratory tract with new radiologic infiltrates and proven RSV LRTI as RSV detected in BAL fluid with new radiologic infiltrates. Immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) and Severe Immunodeficiency (SID) criteria were calculated for HCT recipients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with 60-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Mortality was high in HM patients (25%), but there was no difference between those without HCT, autologous or allo-HCT recipients in logistic regression models. Separate multivariate models showed that at RSV diagnosis, neutropenia (OR 8.3, 95% CI 2.8\u201324.2, p=0.005) and lymphopenia (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.7\u20138.2, p=0.001) were associated with 60-day mortality. Proven LRTI was associated with higher 60-day mortality (neutropenia model: OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7\u201313.5; lymphopenia model: OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.2\u20138.8), and higher ICU admission. In HCT recipients, high ISI and very severe immunodeficiency by SID criteria were associated with higher 60-day all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is similarly high among HM patients without HCT and HCT recipients. High-grade immunodeficiency and detection of RSV from BAL fluid are associated with higher 60-day mortality.","publish_time":"2018-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vakil, Erik; Sheshadri, Ajay; Faiz, Saadia A.; Shah, Dimpy P.; Zhu, Yayuan; Li, Liang; Kmeid, Joumana; Azzi, Jacques; Balagani, Amulya; Bashoura, Lara; Ariza-Heredia, Ella; Chemaly, Roy F.","journal":"Transplant Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/262f4ec7b65be8279dc5b6eb4d160647ed42f574.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6329612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195271/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV LRTI","RSV","BAL","ICU","ISI","SID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day mortality","high mortality","proven RSV LRTI","allo-HCT recipients","possible RSV LRTI","day all-cause mortality","detection of RSV","RSV diagnosis","Proven LRTI","HM patients","higher risk","high ISI","Severe Immunodeficiency","High-grade immunodeficiency","higher ICU admission","new radiologic infiltrates","upper respiratory tract","BAL fluid","SID criteria","Immunodeficiency Scoring Index","logistic regression models","neutropenia model","lymphopenia model","lower respiratory tract infection","Respiratory syncytial virus","Multivariable logistic regression analyses","independent risk factors","Separate multivariate models","allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant","hematologic malignancies","retrospective cohort of adults","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","difference","CONCLUSIONS","institution"],"language":"en"},

The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Macchiagodena, Marina; Pagliai, Marco; Procacci, Piero","journal":"Chem Phys Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/608ae7d97323c5daa3f9adb324924608edf34cf7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8fa4ff7522cbaf9f1a8fdf6820d39ff910fc0556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313296/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261420304048; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009261420304048; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2020.137489","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV2 main proteases","SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus","potent docked ligands","X-ray structure","ligand-binding","multimodal structure-based design","common binding pattern","non-covalent inhibition","rotatable bonds","aromatic moieties","possible lead compounds","PDB code","6LU7","combination of virtual screening","molecular dynamics techniques","pseudo-linear arrangement","monomer","computational strategy","active state","calculations"],"language":"en"},

Several experimental trials have proven a broadening of the protection spectrum when animals are vaccinated with multiple genotypes. Nevertheless, the conditions of vaccine administration in field are so different that the generalization of experimental results is, at least, questionable. In the present study a large scale epidemiological-phylodynamic approach was used to reconstruct the demographic history of the major field genotype (i.e. the QX one) circulating in Italy and Spain. These two countries were selected because, even if they share a comparable epidemiological scenario, the implemented vaccination protocols did not vary in Spain while changed dramatically in Italy over the time period considered. One hundred and ninety-five Italian and 98 Spanish non-recombinant sequences of the hyper-variable region of the S1 gene obtained between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed using a serial coalescent-based approach to reconstruct viral population history over time. While the IBV QX population dynamics remained constant in Spain, a much more complex pattern was evidenced in Italy; both in terms of viral population size and clinical outbreak frequency. Remarkably, a strong association with changes in vaccination strategies was recognized. This allowed demonstrating, by accomplishing all Hill\u2019s criteria for causation, the cause-effect relationship between the vaccine administration/withdrawal and the variation in viral population dynamics and, above all, IBV related outbreaks. Thus, a robust confirmation about the efficacy of IBV vaccination in field conditions was provided. Additionally, the history herein reported testifies the primary importance of rigorously planning not only the intervention strategies but also their monitoring and evaluation.","publish_time":"2016-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Blanco, Angela; Nofrar\u00EDas, Miquel; Biarn\u00E9s, Mar; Cortey, Marti; Maj\u00F3, Nat\u00E0lia; Catelli, Elena; Cecchinato, Mattia","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec47b828779bbf11f1f28a9196c87c24662bfe4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27670071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16308271; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.09.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16308271","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["viral population history","viral population dynamics","IBV QX population dynamics","Spain","Italy","efficacy of IBV vaccination","vaccination strategies","field conditions","terms of viral population size","conditions of vaccine administration","demographic history","IBV related outbreaks","implemented vaccination protocols","major field genotype","different strains","protection spectrum","intervention strategies","experimental trials","time period","large scale epidemiological-phylodynamic approach","comparable epidemiological scenario","limited cross-protection","generalization of experimental results","serial coalescent-based approach","hyper-variable region","Spanish non-recombinant sequences","rapid evolution of Infectious bronchitis virus","withdrawal","variation","cause-effect relationship","clinical outbreak frequency","causation","animals","control","broadening","extreme variability","present study","Hill\u2019s criteria","S1 gene","Italian","strong association","changes","robust confirmation","monitoring","key challenge","complex pattern","multiple genotypes","demonstrating","evaluation","primary importance","countries"],"language":"en"},

Here, we proposed a method for predicting coronaviral 3CLpro cleavage sites which balances the prediction accuracy and false positive outcomes. By applying this method to MERS-CoV, the 11 canonical cleavage sites were readily identified and verified by the biochemical assays. The Michaelis constant of the canonical cleavage sites of MERS-CoV showed that the substrate specificity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is relatively conserved. Interestingly, nine putative non-canonical cleavage sites were predicted and three of them could be cleaved by MERS-CoV nsp5.

In this study, we demonstrate that the production of IL-10 in the liver is elevated in C57BL/6 mice during late acute MCMV infection. Using IL-10 green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter knock-in mice, designated IL-10-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-GFP-enhanced reporter (tiger), NK cells are identified as major IL-10 expressing cells in the liver after infection, along with T cells and other leukocytes.

Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition. RESULTS: A total of 86 pooled commercial meat, 54 companion, 14 pooled laboratory, and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region. In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing \u2265 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P \u003C 0.01), Proteobacteria (P \u003C 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P \u003C 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.

The document requires all 194 World Health Organization (WHO) Member States to detect, assess, notify and report any potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under specific timelines. Annex 2 of the IHR outlines decision-making criteria for State-appointed National Focal Points (NFP) to report potential PHEICs to the WHO, and is a critical component to the effective functioning of the IHRs. METHODS: The aim of the study was to review and evaluate the functioning of Annex 2 across WHO-reporting States Parties. Specific objectives were to ascertain NFP awareness and knowledge of Annex 2, practical use of the tool, activities taken to implement it, its perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Qualitative telephone interviews, followed by a quantitative online survey, were administered to NFPs between October, 2009 and February, 2010. RESULTS: A total of 29 and 133 NFPs participated in the qualitative and quantitative studies, respectively. Qualitative interviews found most NFPs had a strong working knowledge of Annex 2; perceived the tool to be relevant and useful for guiding decisions; and had institutionalized management, legislation and communication systems to support it. NFPs also perceived Annex 2 as human and disease-centric, and emphasized its reduced applicability to potential PHEICs involving bioterrorist attacks, infectious diseases among animals, radio-nuclear and chemical spills, and water- or food-borne contamination. Among quantitative survey respondents, 88% reported having excellent/good knowledge of Annex 2; 77% reported always/usually using Annex 2 for assessing potential PHEICs; 76% indicated their country had some legal, regulatory or administrative provisions for using Annex 2; 95% indicated Annex 2 was always/usually useful for facilitating decisions regarding notifiability of potential PHEICs. CONCLUSION: This evaluation, including a large sample of WHO-reporting States Parties, found that the IHR\u0027s Annex 2 is perceived as useful for guiding decisions about notifiability of potential PHEICs. There is scope for the WHO to expand training and guidance on application of the IHR\u0027s Annex 2 to specific contexts. Continued monitoring and evaluation of the functioning of the IHR is imperative to promoting global health security.","publish_time":"2012-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anema, Aranka; Druyts, Eric; Hollmeyer, Helge G; Hardiman, Maxwell C; Wilson, Kumanan","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16ab54289da4d53548b4cf171a642e19fd81e660.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3313850.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-8603-8-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22233652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHR","Annex","IHR\u0027s Annex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functioning of Annex","IHR\u0027s Annex","good knowledge of Annex","notifiability of potential PHEICs","strong working knowledge of Annex","NFPs","International Health Regulations","potential public health emergency of international concern","public health risks","guiding decisions","Qualitative interviews","perceived usefulness","World Health Organization","global health security","reporting States Parties","Member States","specific timelines","Specific objectives","specific contexts","effective functioning","tool","quantitative online survey","quantitative survey respondents","Qualitative telephone interviews","quantitative studies","evaluation","IHRs","aim of governing international responses","NFP awareness","bioterrorist attacks","animals","infectious diseases","radio-nuclear","institutionalized management","reduced applicability","National Focal Points","water","chemical spills","decision-making criteria","practical use","large sample","legislation","communication systems","administrative provisions","emergencies","guidance","application","disease-centric","food","activities","critical component","country","document","BACKGROUND","contamination","training","METHODS","study","user-friendliness","total","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, some viruses are inherently refractory to cloning in high-copy-number plasmids due to toxicity of viral sequences to E. coli. We report a strategy that is a compromise between infectivity of the RNA transcripts and toxicity to E. coli effected by introducing frameshift mutations into \u201Cslippery sequences\u201D near the viral \u201Ctoxicity sequences\u201D in the viral cDNA. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) has cDNA sequences that are toxic to E. coli. The original full-length infectious cDNA of CTV and a derivative replicon, CTV-\u0394Cla, cloned into pUC119, resulted in unusually limited E. coli growth. However, upon sequencing of these cDNAs, an additional uridinylate (U) was found in a stretch of U\u2019s between nts 3726 and 3731 that resulted in a change to a reading frame with a stop codon at nt 3734. Yet, in vitro produced RNA transcripts from these clones infected protoplasts, and the resulting progeny virus was repaired. Correction of the frameshift mutation in the CTV cDNA constructs resulted in increased infectivity of in vitro produced RNA transcripts, but also caused a substantial increase of toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to develop visible colonies. Frameshift mutations created in sequences not suspected to facilitate reading frame shifting and silent mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions resulted in complete loss of infectivity, suggesting that the oligo(U) region facilitated the repair of the frameshift mutation. Additional frameshift mutations introduced into other oligo(U) regions also resulted in transcripts with reduced infectivity similarly to the original clones with the \u002B1 insertion. However, only the frameshift mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions that were near and before the toxicity region improved growth and stability in E. coli. These data demonstrate that, when hosts are sufficiently susceptible for infection by transcripts of reduced specific infectivity, introduction of frameshift mutations at \u201Cslippery sequences\u201D near toxic regions of viral cDNAs can be used as an additional strategy to clone recalcitrant viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids for reverse genetics.","publish_time":"2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Satyanarayana, Tatineni; Gowda, Siddarame; Ayll\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa A; Dawson, William O","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8955a2c1aff6d08b67a3048252c4d1eae508441d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125997.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203003878; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203003878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["RNA","CTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["toxicity sequences","toxicity of viral sequences","cDNA sequences","Additional frameshift mutations","introduction of frameshift mutations","slippery sequences","coli growth","recalcitrant viral sequences","oligo","produced RNA transcripts","reduced infectivity","number plasmids of Escherichia coli","toxic regions of viral cDNAs","silent mutations","transcripts of reduced specific infectivity","high-copy","increased infectivity of","CTV cDNA constructs","CTV-\u0394Cla","toxicity region improved growth","additional strategy","original full-length infectious cDNA of CTV","complete loss of infectivity","stranded RNA viruses","substantial increase of toxicity","original clones","reading frame","additional uridinylate","cloning","advent of reverse genetics","clones infected protoplasts","resulting progeny virus","Citrus tristeza virus","study of positive","infection","derivative replicon","stability","stop codon","repair","compromise","hosts","pUC119","days","stretch of U\u2019s","nts","visible colonies","change","insertion","sequencing","Correction","data"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To obtain a thorough understanding of substrate specificity of the protease, a substrate library of 19[Image: see text]8 variants was created by performing saturation mutagenesis on the autocleavage sequence at P5 to P3\u0027 positions. The substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. P5 and P3 positions prefer residues with high \u03B2-sheet propensity; P4 prefers small hydrophobic residues; P2 prefers hydrophobic residues without \u03B2-branch. Gln is the best residue at P1 position, but observable cleavage can be detected with His and Met substitutions. P1\u0027 position prefers small residues, while P2\u0027 and P3\u0027 positions have no strong preference on residue substitutions. Noteworthy, solvent exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3\u0027 positions favour positively charged residues over negatively charged one, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a role in catalysis. A super-active substrate, which combined the preferred residues at P5 to P1 positions, was found to have 2.8 fold higher activity than the wild-type sequence.

As practices are now considering reintroduction of elective endoscopy, we conducted a survey of North American practices to identify reactivation barriers and strategies. Methods We designed and electronically distributed a web-based survey to North American gastroenterologists consisting of seven domains: institutional demographics, impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy practice, elective endoscopy resumption plans, anesthesia modifications, personal protective equipment (PPE) policies, fellowship training and telemedicine use. Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based. Results In total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemic\u2019s peak (as reported by the respondent), practices saw a 90% drop in endoscopy volume with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, PPE availability, and pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing availability were ranked as the three primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify pre-procedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (p=0.001). Pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing was planned by only 49.2% of practices overall; when testing is performed and negative, 52.9% of practices will continue to utilize N95 masks. Conclusion This survey highlights barriers and variable strategies for reactivation of elective endoscopy services following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more widespread access to pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 tests with superior performance characteristics is needed to increase provider and patient comfort in proceeding with elective endoscopy.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kushnir, Vladimir M.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Elmunzer, B.

Their success relies on their capacity to generate genetic variability and, consequently, on their adaptive potential. We describe a strategy to attenuate RNA viruses by altering their evolutionary potential. We rationally altered the genomes of Coxsackie B3 and influenza A viruses to redirect their evolutionary trajectories towards detrimental regions in sequence space. Specifically, viral genomes were engineered to harbour more serine and leucine codons with nonsense mutation targets: codons that could generate Stop mutations after a single nucleotide substitution. Indeed, these viruses generated more Stop mutations both in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by significant losses in viral fitness. In vivo, the viruses were attenuated, generated high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protected against lethal challenge. Our study demonstrates that cornering viruses in \u2018risky\u2019 areas of sequence space may be implemented as a broad-spectrum vaccine strategy against RNA viruses.

In general, this pathogen infects debilitated patients either by comorbidities or by any form of immunodeficiency. In cases of respiratory infection, tobacco abuse seems to play an important role as a risk factor. In previously healthy patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with P. aeruginosa as the etiological agent is extremely rare, and unlike the cases involving immunocompromised or hospitalized patients, the outcome is severe, and is fatal in up to 61.1% of cases. Aerosolized contaminated water or solutions are closely linked to the development of respiratory tract infection. In this setting, metalworking fluids used in factories may be implicated in CAP involving previously healthy people. The authors report the case of a middle-aged man who worked in a metalworking factory and presented a right upper lobar pneumonia with a rapid fatal outcome. P. aeruginosa was cultured from blood and tracheal aspirates. The autopsy findings confirmed a hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia with bacteria-invading vasculitis and thrombosis.

Objectives The aim of the study was to examine if saffold virus is capable of causing invasive infection in the human myocardium. Study design Using real-time PCR, we retrospectively examined formalin-fixed paraffin embedded cardiac tissue specimens from 150 deceased individuals diagnosed with myocarditis at autopsy. The results were compared with histological findings. Results and conclusions Saffold virus was detected in the myocardium, lung tissue and blood of one child and was accompanied by histopathological inflammation in the heart and lungs, which was supportive of a viral infection. These findings suggest that cardioviruses may be associated with myocarditis in humans.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nielsen, Trine Skov; Nielsen, Alex Yde; Banner, Jytte; Hansen, Jakob; Baandrup, Ulrik; Nielsen, Lars Peter","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f38fb938727323ef8fbc57060a85a905797b064.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106523.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215007726; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.11.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687438/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215007726","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conclusions Saffold virus","human myocardium","Abstract Background Saffold virus","histopathological inflammation","human viruses","human disease","myocarditis","genus cardioviruses","results","lung tissue","invasive infection","accompanying histopathological signs of inflammation","Study design","viral infection","histological findings","cardiac tissue specimens","deceased individuals","formalin-fixed paraffin","child","studies","real-time PCR","animals","heart","lungs","blood","severe infections","different anatomical compartments","autopsy","Objectives","aim","humans"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnosis of ABM is critical, as this is most commonly associated with severe sequelae with associated high mortality and morbidity rates compared to viral meningitis, which is less severe and self-limiting. We have designed a microarray for detection and diagnosis of ABM. This has been validated using randomly amplified DNA targets (RADT), comparing buffers with or without formamide, in glass slide format or on the Alere ArrayTube(TM) (Alere Technologies GmbH) microarray platform. Pathogen-specific signals were observed using purified bacterial nucleic acids and to a lesser extent using patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples, with some technical issues observed using RADT and glass slides. Repurposing the array onto the Alere ArrayTube(TM) platform and using a targeted amplification system increased specific and reduced nonspecific hybridization signals using both pathogen nucleic and patient CSF DNA targets, better revealing pathogen-specific signals although sensitivity was still reduced in the latter.

Applying the Pontryagin\u2019s Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang\u2013bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolzoni, Luca; Bonacini, Elena; Soresina, Cinzia; Groppi, Maria","journal":"Mathematical Biosciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfc3342db95f321473f6e5613b911648cc850393.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094293.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556416302954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28801246/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556416302954; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2017.07.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maximum control","costs of control","maximal control","control action","unconstrained control problems","time-optimal control problem","different control policies","control reproduction number","optimal strategy","epidemic duration","unconstrained problems","total infectious burden","epidemic models","entire epidemic","switching time","additional unexpected results","maximum rate","bang controls","minimization of outbreaks duration","isolation","PMP","SIR","livestock diseases","Susceptible-Infected","animal movements","culling","priority","previous findings","vaccination","ongoing epidemics","sanitary restrictions","contrast","numerical simulations","wide range of epidemiological circumstances","Pontryagin\u2019s Minimum Principle","export bans","remainder","resource limitations","reduction of transmission","critical consequence","peak of infection"],"language":"en"},

Physical characteristics of inhaled particles and airway mucosal immunity determine which viruses and microbes will persist in the airways. Here we present the first metagenomic study of DNA viral communities in the airways of diseased and non-diseased individuals. We obtained sequences from sputum DNA viral communities in 5 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 5 individuals without the disease. Overall, diversity of viruses in the airways was low, with an average richness of 175 distinct viral genotypes. The majority of viral diversity was uncharacterized. CF phage communities were highly similar to each other, whereas Non-CF individuals had more distinct phage communities, which may reflect organisms in inhaled air. CF eukaryotic viral communities were dominated by a few viruses, including human herpesviruses and retroviruses. Functional metagenomics showed that all Non-CF viromes were similar, and that CF viromes were enriched in aromatic amino acid metabolism. The CF metagenomes occupied two different metabolic states, probably reflecting different disease states. There was one outlying CF virome which was characterized by an over-representation of Guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate,3\u2032-diphosphate pyrophosphatase, an enzyme involved in the bacterial stringent response. Unique environments like the CF airway can drive functional adaptations, leading to shifts in metabolic profiles. These results have important clinical implications for CF, indicating that therapeutic measures may be more effective if used to change the respiratory environment, as opposed to shifting the taxonomic composition of resident microbiota.","publish_time":"2009-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willner, Dana; Furlan, Mike; Haynes, Matthew; Schmieder, Robert; Angly, Florent E.; Silva, Joas; Tammadoni, Sassan; Nosrat, Bahador; Conrad, Douglas; Rohwer, Forest","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac6fa92b6f98b4b06beaad7c540d70f616ca0e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2756586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19816605/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007370","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CF airway","CF phage communities","Non-CF individuals","CF metagenomes","CF eukaryotic viral communities","Non-CF viromes","outlying CF virome","sputum DNA viral communities","distinct phage communities","non-diseased individuals","diversity of viruses","metagenomic study of DNA viral communities","distinct viral genotypes","majority of viral diversity","airways of diseased","microbes","different metabolic states","wide variety of viruses","different disease states","inhaled air","human respiratory tract","environmental air","functional adaptations","metabolic profiles","Functional metagenomics","human herpesviruses","respiratory environment","airway mucosal immunity","Physical characteristics of inhaled particles","inorganic particulates","average richness","enzyme","water","cystic fibrosis","important clinical implications","aromatic amino acid metabolism","shifts","results","organisms","sequences","therapeutic measures","taxonomic composition of resident microbiota","triphosphate","diphosphate pyrophosphatase","bacterial stringent response","food","retroviruses","Unique environments","over-representation of Guanosine"],"language":"en"},

Here we studied the human HIV-specific antibody response in the circulation of mice after intrasplenic transfer of PBMC from untreated HIV-infected patients with detectable to high viral load as well as from HAART-treated and from untreated patients, who kept an undetectable viral load (the latter referred to as \u201Cnatural suppressors\u201D). Excellent B cell expansion was obtained for all PBMC. High level replication of virus was observed after transfer of PBMC of untreated viremic patients only. A strong and multispecific HIV-specific antibody response was observed after transfer of PBMC of untreated viremic patients and natural suppressors. In contrast, only a weak and pauci-specific antibody response was detected in mice reconstituted with PBMC from successfully treated patients. Based on these observations we conclude that the use of the intraspleen mouse model confirmed a) the presence of HIV-specific circulating memory B cells in untreated patients and natural suppressors; b) the nearly complete absence of circulating memory B cells in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy. Currently and for a long time in the future, the development of GIS should be strengthened to form a data-driven system for rapid knowledge acquisition, which signifies that GIS should be used to reinforce the social operation parameterization of models and methods, especially when providing support for social management.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Chenghu; Su, Fenzhen; Pei, Tao; Zhang, An; Du, Yunyan; Luo, Bin; Cao, Zhidong; Wang, Juanle; Yuan, Wen; Zhu, Yunqiang; Song, Ci; Chen, Jie; Xu, Jun; Li, Fujia; Ma, Ting; Jiang, Lili; Yan, Fengqin; Yi, Jiawei; Hu, Yunfeng; Liao, Yilan; Xiao, Han","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eef7cb7875ec7dfa491e8b4887dc1711534caa4f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/da5e51e2d4387c6da6162cae1000bd6dd55e5840.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666683920300092; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666683920300092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Geographic Information Systems","GIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data level","data acquisition","data preparation","big data technologies","era of big data","data-driven system","integration of heterogeneous data","social management","rapid aggregation of multi-source big data","social functioning","development of GIS","rapid visualization of epidemic information","solid spatial information support","spatial analysis methods","spatial segmentation","prevention level","technical level","social-emotional guidance","accuracy of information provision","rapid knowledge acquisition","Geographic Information Systems","epidemic risk","widespread epidemic","traditional technical methods","social operation parameterization of models","effectiveness assessment of COVID","use of GIS faces difficulties","spatial tracking of confirmed cases","platform construction","model construction","measures formulation","map production","thousands of deaths","formulation of relevant policies","life","prediction of regional transmission","decision-making","panic elimination","speed","demand of material resources","strategies","governments","complete technological route","main challenge","important role","human health","academic institutions","supply","aspects","novel coronavirus disease","future","international relations","businesses","outbreak","result","long time","number of infections","people","struggle","fight","control","ascendancy","diverse enterprises"],"language":"en"},

This lymphopenia leads to type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (T1DM) at rates up to 100% when combined with the BB rat MHC RT1 u/u genotype. In order, to better study the lymphopenia phenotype without possible confounding effects of diabetes or other autoimmune disease, we generated congenic F344.lyp rats by introgression of lyp on diabetes-resistant MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 F344 rats. Analysis of thymic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes revealed no difference in the percentage of CD4\u2212CD8\u002Band CD4\u002BCD8\u2212subsets in lyp/lyp compared to \u002B/\u002B F344 rats. The same subsets was however dramatically reduced in blood (P=0.005), spleen (P=0.019) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (P\u003C0.0001). Compared to F344 \u002B/\u002B rats double positive CD4\u002BCD8\u002BT cells were increased only in lyp/lyp spleen (P=0.034) while double negative CD4\u2212CD8\u2212were increased in thymus (P=0.033), spleen (P=0.012), MLN (P\u003C0.0001), and peripheral blood (P\u003C0.0001). There were no signs of inflammatory lesions in organs and tissues in F344.lyp/lyp rats examined at 120 days of age or older. We thus conclude that the lymphopenia phenotype was reconstituted by introgression of lyp on to F344 rats without subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmunity. The congenic F344.lyp rat should prove useful to dissect the mechanisms by which the Ian5 frameshift mutation affects T cell selection, differentiation and maturation without organ-specific autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moralejo, Daniel H.; Park, Hyunhee A.; Speros, Sara J.; MacMurray, Armand J.; Kwitek, Anne E.; Jacob, Howard J.; Lander, Eric S.; Lernmark, \u00C5ke","journal":"Journal of Autoimmunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbed2ab18cb16dd893636d982a873f73f3550605.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126882.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841103001380; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841103001380","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BB rat MHC","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lyp rats","lyp spleen","introgression of lyp","lv1 F344 rats","CD8 T lymphocytes","positive CD4","lymphopenia phenotype","percentage of CD4","double negative CD4","Abstract Peripheral T cell lymphopenia","T cells","rat chromosome","BB rat MHC RT1 u","T cell selection","Analysis of thymic CD4","diabetes-resistant MHC RT1 lv1","diabetes mellitus","Ian5 frameshift mutation","organ-specific autoimmunity","MLN","peripheral blood","subsets","possible confounding effects of diabetes","u genotype","subsequent development of organ","maturation","differentiation","gene family","Immune Associated Nucleotide","member","better study","insulin-dependent","organs","autoimmune disease","tissues","difference","mesenteric lymph nodes","T1DM","mechanisms","signs of inflammatory lesions","BioBreeding","days of age","rates","order","thymus"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a multidisciplinary perspective is required to sketch why a transition from diets based primarily on animal proteins towards diets based primarily on plant proteins products is extremely urgent for both food security and sustainability. Scope and approach This review starts out by identifying ecological, economic and social aspects of sustainable food consumption. Subsequently, it is argued how protein supply is underlying and linking the top-3 of anthropogenic impacts based on the planetary boundaries concept, i.e. 1) biodiversity loss, 2) nitrogen cycle acceleration, and 3) carbon cycle acceleration (resulting in climate change). These environmental impacts associated with current Western food consumption need to be reduced urgently. In order to address the inefficiencies inherent to current dietary patterns, therefore, a ranked list of more sustainable options is proposed, based on their order of magnitude. Addressing consumers, industry, and governmental stakeholders plus cultural aspects, challenges and options are sketched. Key findings and conclusions Clearly, a dietary transition from primarily animal towards plant protein products is required. Fortunately, new dietary guidelines are increasingly taking sustainability into account and the contours of a diet transition are slowly emerging.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aiking, Harry; de Boer, Joop","journal":"Trends Food Sci Technol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a757532b35c9154a3573aee09d28ac3c03ead38d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127173.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224418301213; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224418301213","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dietary transition","rapid transition","diet transition","sustainable options","social aspects of sustainable food consumption","current dietary patterns","current Western food consumption","plant proteins products","food security","animal proteins","sustainability","diets","plant protein products","carbon cycle acceleration","Sustainable Development Goals","nitrogen cycle acceleration","new dietary guidelines","cultural aspects","environmental impacts","anthropogenic impacts","protein supply","order of magnitude","governmental stakeholders","biodiversity loss","challenges","inefficiencies inherent","planetary boundaries concept","ranked list","industry","account","contours","conclusions","Abstract Background","climate change","consumers","circular economy","Key findings","review","multidisciplinary perspective","Scope"],"language":"en"},

Several viruses can modulate the formation of SG with different effects, but the relationship between SG formation and EV71 infection is poorly understood. In this study, we report that EV71 inhibits canonical SGs formation in infected cells and induces the formation of novel RNA granules that were distinguished from canonical SGs in composition and morphology, which we termed \u2018SG like structures\u2019. Our results also demonstrated that EV71 triggered formation of SG-like structures is dependent on PKR and eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation and requires ongoing cellular mRNA synthesis. Finally, we found that SG-like structures are antiviral RNA granules that promote cellular apoptosis and suppress EV71 propagation. Taken together, our findings explain the formation mechanism of SG-like structures induced by EV71 and shed light on virus-host interaction and molecular mechanism underlying EV71 pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Yuanmei; Wang, Bei; Huang, He; Zhao, Zhendong","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3f8a927d16b29f381241e2ecca7bc13f048550c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124267.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X16308026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216457/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X16308026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formation of SG","SG formation","formation mechanism of SG","EV71 infection","canonical SGs formation","EV71 pathogenesis","EV71 propagation","formation of novel RNA granules","antiviral RNA granules","dynamic cytoplasmic granules","Abstract Stress granules","cellular apoptosis","molecular mechanism","viral infection","ongoing cellular mRNA synthesis","virus-host interaction","eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","shed light","relationship","infected cells","PKR","response","variety of stresses","different effects","morphology","composition","findings","results","viruses","study","structures\u2019"],"language":"en"},

There are still many unknowns on the implication of cellular factors that regulate the entry process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the carboxy-terminal endodomain of S, which faces the cytosol during and after opening of the fusion pore at early stages of the virus life cycle. Here we show that the ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain and that both the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acids and a membrane-proximal cysteine cluster of S endodomain are important for this interaction in vitro. Interestingly, we found that ezrin is present at the site of entry of S-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in Vero E6 cells. Targeting ezrin function by small interfering RNA increased S-mediated entry of pseudotyped particles in epithelial cells. Furthermore, deletion of the eight carboxy-terminal amino acids of S enhanced S-pseudotyped particles infection. Expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ezrin interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain and limits virus entry and fusion.

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 \u00B0C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Ma, Qiuyue; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Yaping; Du, Min; Liu, Min","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3c0a8ba2dc4e9f7ca6e4152f3266a1616e1a63f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187824.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325687?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["daily new cases","daily new deaths of COVID","Daily data","relative humidity","reduction","effects of temperature","humidity increases","meteorological conditions","effect of meteorological parameters","pandemic","findings","Global Health Security Index","global health crisis","national population","population density","coronavirus disease","C increase","Human Development Index","respiratory infectious disease epidemics","crucial factors","different lag structures","median age","wind speed","time","Log-linear generalized additive model","results","sensitivity analysis","greatest challenge","block transmission","useful implications","potential confounders","preliminary evidence","source of infection","policymakers","public","world","study","countries","China","active measures"],"language":"en"},

Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care.

Background RVLS obtained from two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) has been recently demonstrated to be a more accurate and sensitive tool to estimate RV function. The prognostic value of RVLS in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Methods 120 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography examination were enrolled in our study. Conventional right ventricular (RV) function parameters, including RV fractional area change (RVFAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid tissue Doppler annular velocities (S\u2019), were obtained. RVLS was determined by 2D-STE. RV function was categorized by tertiles of RVLS. Results Compared with patients in the highest RVLS tertile, those in the lowest tertile were more likely to have a higher heart rate, D-dimer and C-reactive protein, high-flow oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation therapy, higher incidence of acute heart injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and deep vein thrombosis, and higher mortality. After a median follow-up of 51 days, 18 patients died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors displayed enlarged right-heart chamber, diminished RV function, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Male, ARDS, RVLS, RVFAC and TAPSE were significant univariate predictors of higher risk of mortality (P \u003C 0.05 for all). The Cox model using RVLS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.33, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.15\uFF5E1.53; P \u003C 0.001; Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] =129; C-index = 0.89) was found to predict higher mortality more accurately than that with RVFAC (AIC =142; C-index = 0.84) and TAPSE (AIC = 144; C-index = 0.83).

However, high-level expression and purification of recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is difficult because rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21. To overcome this problem, we fused the FGF21 with SUMO (Small ubiquitin-related modifier) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expressed the fused gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). RESULTS: By inducing with IPTG, SUMO-FGF21 was expressed at a high level. Its concentration reached 30% of total protein, and exceeded 95% of all soluble proteins. The fused protein was purified by DEAE sepharose FF and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the purity of rFGF21 by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was shown to be higher than 96% with low endotoxin level (\u003C1.0 EU/ml). The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that rFGF21 produced by using this method, could decrease the concentration of plasma glucose in diabetic rats by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that SUMO, when fused with FGF21, was able to promote its soluble expression of the latter in E. coli, making it more convenient to purify rFGF21 than previously. This may be a better method to produce rFGF21 for pharmaceutical research and development.","publish_time":"2010-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huiyan; Xiao, Yechen; Fu, Lianjun; Zhao, Hongxin; Zhang, Yaofang; Wan, Xiaoshan; Qin, Yuxia; Huang, Yadong; Gao, Hongchang; Li, Xiaokun","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b187316c24eb26f96af6ebbc243e90cfc504d94b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2831817.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-10-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20163718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DEAE","EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SUMO-FGF21","purity of rFGF21","high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21","fused protein","rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies","Escherichia coli","coli BL21","high level","SUMO protease","fused gene","purification of recombinant FGF21","soluble expression","results of","high performance liquid chromatography","high-level expression","better method","total protein","soluble proteins","concentration of plasma glucose","low endotoxin level","Ni-NTA affinity chromatography","DEAE sepharose FF","diabetic rats","Small ubiquitin-related modifier","streptozotocin","polymerase chain reaction","promising drug candidate","HPLC","bacteria","pharmaceutical research","metabolic diseases","STZ","PCR","Fibroblast growth factor","BACKGROUND","injection","DE3","development","animal experiments","IPTG","CONCLUSIONS","study","problem"],"language":"en"},

Methods Prospective single center study over one winter season (November 2005\u2013May 2006) with hospitalized children without age restriction using PCR-based diagnostic methods. Results HBoV DNA was detected in 11 (2.8%) of 389 nasopharyngeal aspirates from symptomatic hospitalized children (median age 9.0 months; range: 3\u201317 months). RSV, HMPV, HCoV, and Influenza B were detected in 13.9% (n =54), 5.1% (n =20), 2.6% (n =10), and 1.8% (n =7), respectively. There was no influenza A DNA detected in any of the specimens.

Respiratory viruses are a frequent and potentially serious cause of infection after solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, clinical manifestations of respiratory virus infection (RVI) may be more severe and unusual in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) compared with the non-immunocompromised population. Areas covered: This article reviews the non-influenza RVIs that are commonly encountered in SOTRs. Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics are highlighted and available treatment options are discussed. Expert opinion: New diagnostic tools, particularly rapid molecular assays, have expanded the ability to identify specific RVI pathogens in SOTRs. This is not only useful from a treatment standpoint but also to guide infection control practices. More data are needed on RVIs in the solid organ transplant population, particularly regarding their effect on rejection and graft dysfunction. There is also a need for new antiviral agents active against these infections as well as markers that can identify which patients would most benefit from treatment.","publish_time":"2017-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grim, Shellee A.; Reid, Gail E.; Clark, Nina M.","journal":"Expert Opin Pharmacother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f7940bc0ca1e198694f7258fb08f8bf0fe1ed3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103702.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28425766/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2017.1322063","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["solid organ transplantation","solid organ transplant population","SOTRs","solid organ transplant recipients","serious cause of infection","clinical manifestations of respiratory virus infection","infection control practices","treatment standpoint","non-influenza RVIs","available treatment options","non-immunocompromised population","prevention of rejection","graft survival","clinical characteristics","graft dysfunction","Respiratory viruses","New diagnostic tools","common cause of morbidity","specific RVI pathogens","new antiviral agents active","regard","increased patient","rapid molecular assays","improved outcomes","infections","ability","effect","need","Expert opinion","article","mortality","patients","markers","Introduction","benefit","Areas","data"],"language":"en"},

A series of wind tunnel experiments were conducted using a 1:30 scale model that represented the real structures under study. The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of concentration fluctuations through transient analysis. Tracer gas was continuously released from a point source located at different positions, and a time series of fluctuating concentrations were recorded at a large number of points using fast flame ionization detectors. The experimental data were analysed to provide a comprehensive data set including variances and associated statistical quantities. Both the unsteady characteristics of the system and their potential practical impact are presented and discussed. Under crowd living conditions, the air pollutant exhausted from one household could probably re-enter into the neighbouring households, traveling with ambient airflow. Such pollutant dispersion process is defined as air cross-contamination in this study. The results indicate that the wind-induced cross-contamination around the studied type of high-rise building should not be overlooked, and the fluctuating concentrations should be paid attention to particularly during the evaluation of a potential contamination risk. This study can help deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of air cross-contamination, and will be useful for implementing optimization strategies to improve the built environments in metropolitan cities such as Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, X.

To determine the evolutionary history of rodent CoVs in more detail, particularly the relative frequencies of virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission, we recovered longer fragments of CoV genomes from previously discovered European rodent alpha-CoVs using a combination of PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Accordingly, the full genome sequence was retrieved from the UK rat coronavirus, along with partial genome sequences from the UK field vole and Poland-resident bank vole CoVs, and a short conserved ORF1b fragment from the French rabbit CoV. Genome and phylogenetic analysis showed that despite their diverse geographic origins, all rodent alpha-CoVs formed a single monophyletic group and shared similar features, such as the same gene constellations, a recombinant beta-CoV spike gene, and similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). These data suggest that all rodent alpha CoVs sampled so far originate from a single common ancestor, and that there has likely been a long-term association between alpha CoVs and rodents. Despite this likely antiquity, the phylogenetic pattern of the alpha-CoVs was also suggestive of relatively frequent host-jumping among the different rodent species.","publish_time":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Chappell, Joseph G.; Onianwa, Okechukwu; Marston, Denise A.; Fooks, Anthony R.; Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Umhang, G\u00E9rald; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Drexler, Jan F.; Drosten, Christian; Tarlinton, Rachael E.; McClure, Charles P.; Holmes, Edward C.; Ball, Jonathan K.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9000d72e1e522099e6a53feeda6aa6d884a1b179.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6409636.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","UK","TRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rodent alpha CoVs","European rodent alpha-CoVs","evolutionary history of rodent CoVs","rodent coronaviruses","different rodent species","Poland-resident bank vole CoVs","partial genome sequences","CoV genomes","discrete phylogenetic group","phylogenetic pattern","phylogenetic analysis","UK field vole","single monophyletic group","French rabbit CoV","recombinant beta-CoV spike gene","gene constellations","frequent host","Asian rodents","likely antiquity","similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences","host co-divergence","shared similar features","UK rat coronavirus","cross-species transmission","single common ancestor","short conserved ORF1b fragment","combination of PCR","diverse geographic origins","relative frequencies of virus","TRS","recent discovery of novel alphacoronaviruses","long-term association","high-throughput sequencing","genus","data"],"language":"en"},

On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States. That same day, a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in the county reported that several of its residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that many staff had symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The University of Washington Medicine health system (UW Medicine), which is based in Seattle-King County and provides quaternary care for the region, was one of several health care organizations called upon to address this growing crisis. What ensued was a series of swiftly enacted decisions and activities at UW Medicine, in partnership with local, state, and national public health agencies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice; lead policy and practice guideline development; and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting-edge, high-quality, safe care.

Though it is associated with infectious mononucleosis and over 200,000 cancers annually worldwide, a vaccine is not available. The major target of immunity is EBV glycoprotein 350/220 (gp350) that mediates attachment to B cells through complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21). Here, we created self-assembling nanoparticles that displayed different domains of gp350 in a symmetric array. By focusing presentation of the CR2-binding domain on nanoparticles, potent neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice and non-human primates. The structurally designed nanoparticle vaccine improved vaccine-induced protection in a mouse model by targeting a functionally conserved site of vulnerability with 10- to 100-fold increased neutralization compared to soluble gp350. This rational approach to EBV vaccine design elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses by focusing on a conserved viral entry domain, a strategy that can be applied to other viruses.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanekiyo, Masaru; Bu, Wei; Joyce, M.

Ribonucleicacid editing and other features are accurately identified based on sequence similarity and signature residues. VIGOR produces four output files: a gene prediction file, a complementary DNA file, an alignment file, and a gene feature table file. The gene feature table can be used to create GenBank submission. VIGOR takes a single input: viral genomic sequences in FASTA format. VIGOR has been extended to predict genes for 12 viruses: measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, respiratory syncytial virus, alphavirus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, norovirus, metapneumovirus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, parainfluenza virus and Sendai virus. VIGOR accurately detects the complex gene features like ribonucleicacid editing, stop codon leakage and ribosomal shunting.

OBJECTIVES: This study was done to evaluate the degree of overcrowding in local \u201Cteaching hospitals\u201D in Beijing, and to ascertain the apparent root causes for the pervasive degree of overcrowding in these EDs. METHODS: This is a multicenter cross-sectional study. The studied population included all ED patients from 18 metropolitan teaching hospital EDs in Beijing for calendar years 2013 and 2014. Patient characteristics, and the primary reasons that these patients sought care in these EDs, are described. RESULTS: The total numbers of annual emergency visits were 1,554,387 and 1,615,571 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. High acuity cases accounted for 4.6% and 5.5% of the total annual emergency visits in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The percentage of patients placed into \u201CObservation\u201D beds, which were created to accommodate patients deemed to have problems too complex to be treated in an inpatient bed, or to accommodate patients simply needing chronic care, was 11.9% and 13.1% in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The ED-boarded patients accounted for 2.71% and 2.6% of the total annual emergency visits in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The average waiting time to admit the ED-boarded patients was 37.1 h and 36.2 h in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Respiratory symptoms were the most common presenting complaints, and an upper respiratory infection was the most common ED diagnosis. Patients who had pneumonia or various manifestations of end-stage diseases, such as advanced dementia or multiple organ dysfunction, were the most common characteristics of patients who had stays in \u201CObservation\u201D units. CONCLUSIONS: One principal reason for ED crowding in Beijing lies in the large numbers of patients who persist in the expectation of receiving ongoing care in the ED for minor illnesses. However, as is true in many nations, one of the other most important root causes of ED crowding is \u201Caccess block,\u201D the inability to promptly move patients deemed by emergency physicians to need inpatient care to an inpatient bed for that care. However, in our system, another challenge, not widely described as a contributor to crowding in other nations, is that doctors assigned to inpatient services have been empowered to refuse to admit patients perceived to have overly \u201Ccomplex\u201D needs. Further, patients with multisystem illnesses or end-stage status, who need ongoing chronic care to manage activities of daily living, have begun to populate Beijing EDs in increasing numbers. This is an issue with various root causes.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhen; Xiong, Xiaying; Wang, Shuang; Yan, Junguo; Springer, Martin; Dellinger, R.P.","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fd57e68de682f9cf91b1ec2479868fd7215c0ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135171.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467918301185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29573904/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.02.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467918301185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["ED-boarded patients","percentage of patients","common characteristics of patients","large numbers of patients","inpatient care","common ED diagnosis","Beijing EDs","ongoing care","important root causes of ED crowding","total annual emergency visits","total numbers of annual emergency visits","ongoing chronic care","Emergency department","emergency physicians","inpatient bed","various root causes","inpatient services","apparent root causes","metropolitan teaching hospital EDs","pervasive degree of overcrowding","increasing numbers","Observation","nations","end-stage status","common presenting complaints","various manifestations of end","stage diseases","teaching hospitals","Respiratory symptoms","multisystem illnesses","minor illnesses","Patient characteristics","serious issue","upper respiratory infection","multicenter cross-sectional study","advanced dementia","multiple organ dysfunction","principal reason","primary reasons","calendar years","access block","activities of daily living","pneumonia","average waiting time","CONCLUSIONS","doctors","inability","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","studied population","expectation","High acuity cases","METHODS","beds","problems","challenge","contributor","OBJECTIVES","units","needs"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis is a fatal disease of felidae due to a feline coronavirus, occurring mainly in kittens between 6 months and 2 years. This disease manifests clinically in varied symptoms, the most characteristic being the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal or pleural cavity. In fact, there are two feline coronavirus biotypes, which include respectively the virulent strains that cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) and the avirulent strains (FeCV) more common in feline population. The high genetic similarity between FeCV and FIPV strains suggests that FIPVs arise by mutation from avirulent coronavirus FeCVs. This link between the two biotypes makes viral laboratory diagnosis interpretation complex, as currently no diagnostic tool allows distinguishing them. This article presents recent information regarding aetiology, pathogenicity, clinical aspects, epidemiology, diagnosis and prophylaxis of this disease.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le Poder, S.","journal":"EMC - V\u00E9t\u00E9rinaire","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a40503c7ec95b5695220a285c1350e61e391c120.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1762421505000110; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1762421505000110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["two feline coronavirus biotypes","the avirulent strains","PIF","biotypes de coronavirus f\u00E9lins","the most characteristic being the accumulation","The high genetic similarity between FeCV","In fact","souches FeCV","pathog\u00E8nes FeCV","more common in feline population","fluid in the abdominal or pleural cavity","This link between the two biotypes makes viral laboratory diagnosis interpretation complex","which include respectively the virulent strains that cause feline infectious peritonitis","mutation from avirulent coronavirus FeCVs","This disease manifests clinically in varied symptoms","FIPV strains suggests that FIPVs","occurring mainly in kittens between","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis is","fatal disease","mutation g\u00E9n\u00E9tique","population f\u00E9line","interpr\u00E9tation du diagnostic viral","This article presents recent information regarding aetiology","clinical aspects","accumulation de liquide","aspects cliniques","maladie mortelle","forte homologie g\u00E9n\u00E9tique","p\u00E9ritonite infectieuse f\u00E9line","as currently no diagnostic tool allows distinguishing them","pathogenicity","felidae","months","epidemiology","there","\u00E9panchement","prophylaxis","cavit\u00E9 abdominale","test","probl\u00E8me","virus responsables","mois","jeunes animaux","years","f\u00E9lid\u00E9s","sympt\u00F4mes divers","ans","heure actuelle","parent\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 1735], smallpox was a worldwide pathogen. Vaccinations were ceased in 1980 and now with a largely unprotected world population, smallpox is considered the ideal biowarfare agent [Antiviral Res. 57 (2002) 1]. Infection normally occurs after implantation of the virus on the oropharyngeal or respiratory mucosa [J. Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 2127]. Smallpox virus can be detected from the throats of exposed individuals prior to onset of illness and prior to the infectious stage of the illness. A rapid, sensitive real-time assay to detect Variola virus (smallpox) has been developed using the Vaccinia virus, a surrogate of smallpox, as a target. Cyanine 5 dye-labeled anti-Vaccinia antibody was used in a sandwich immunoassay to produce a fluorescent signal in the presence of the Vaccinia virus. The signal was detected using the Analyte 2000 biosensor (Research International, Monroe, WA). The Analyte 2000 uses a 635nm laser diode to provide excitation light that is launched into a polystyrene optical waveguide. Fluorescent molecules within the evanescent wave are excited and a portion of their emission energy recouples into the waveguide. A photodiode quantifies the emission light at wavelengths between 670 and 710nm. The biosensor was able to detect a minimum of 2.5\u00D7105 pfu/ml of Vaccinia virus in seeded throat culture swab specimens.","publish_time":"2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donaldson, Kim A; Kramer, Marianne F; Lim, Daniel V","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8faf766a36e21ff43d3e3fec82247b34efdf2f44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125742.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566304000685; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566304000685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Variola"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Smallpox virus","Vaccinia virus","Variola virus","surrogate of smallpox","anti-Vaccinia antibody","emission light","fluorescent signal","biosensor","Analyte","onset of illness","excitation light","Fluorescent molecules","emission energy","unprotected world population","nm laser diode","polystyrene optical waveguide","World Health Organization\u2019s announcement of total eradication","seeded throat culture swab specimens","sensitive real-time assay","portion","evanescent wave","Research International","sandwich immunoassay","ideal biowarfare agent","Monroe","Abstract","throats of exposed individuals","dye","wavelengths","presence","infectious stage","minimum","Cyanine","photodiode","implantation","respiratory mucosa","pfu","worldwide pathogen","target","Infection","Vaccinations"],"language":"en"},

In the emergency department (ED), such measures have to be balanced with the requirement to treat patients urgently and transfer quickly to an acute hospital bed. We assessed, in a busy and overcrowded ED, the contribution made to a patient\u0027s stay by previous MRSA risk group identification and by selective rescreening of those patients who were previously documented in the research hospital as being MRSA positive. Patients with a previous diagnosis of MRSA colonisation were flagged automatically as \u2018risk group\u2019 (RG) on their arrival in the ED and were compared with \u2018non-risk group\u2019 (NRG), i.e. not previously demonstrated in the research hospital to be infected or colonised with MRSA. Over an 18 month period, there were 16 456 admissions via the ED, of which 985 (6%) were RG patients. The expected median times to be admitted following a request for a ward bed for NRG and RG patients were 10.4 and 12.9h, respectively.

Micro-organisms can be transmitted through inhalation, ingestion, via conjunctiva or physical contact. Close contact with animals is crucial for transmission. The role of intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans for disease transmission is poorly understood. In this systematic review we aimed to summarise current knowledge regarding patterns of human\u2013livestock contacts and their role in micro-organism transmission. METHODS: We included peer-reviewed publications published between 1996 and 2014 in our systematic review if they reported on human\u2013livestock contacts, human cases of livestock-related zoonotic diseases or serological epidemiology of zoonotic diseases in human samples. We extracted any information pertaining the type and intensity of human\u2013livestock contacts and associated zoonoses. RESULTS: 1522 papers were identified, 75 were included: 7 reported on incidental zoonoses after brief animal\u2013human contacts (e.g. farm visits), 10 on environmental exposures and 15 on zoonoses in developing countries where backyard livestock keeping is still customary. 43 studies reported zoonotic risks in different occupations. Occupations at risk included veterinarians, culling personnel, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. For culling personnel, more hours exposed to livestock resulted in more frequent occurrence of transmission. Slaughterhouse workers in contact with live animals were more often positive for zoonotic micro-organisms compared to co-workers only exposed to carcasses. Overall, little information was available about the actual mode of micro-organism transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans that result in micro-organism transmission. Studies performed in occupational settings provide some, but limited evidence of exposure response-like relationships for livestock\u2013human contact and micro-organism transmission. Better understanding of contact patterns driving micro-organism transmission from animals to humans is needed to provide options for prevention and thus deserves more attention.","publish_time":"2016-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klous, Gijs; Huss, Anke; Heederik, Dick J.J.; Coutinho, Roel A.","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a38e42b1f6af103e0fca657462dc516ad51cf7e9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4327c3ea2772234a8f546e73f9fde05ea49fbfe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5462650.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2016.03.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771415300136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771415300136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["livestock contacts","human cases of livestock","human contacts","patterns of human","backyard livestock","intensity of human","type of contact patterns","human samples","human pathogens","disease transmission","physical contact","Close contact","actual mode of micro-organism transmission","zoonotic micro-organisms","frequent occurrence of transmission","Better understanding of contact patterns","zoonotic risks","live animals","vertebrate animals","humans account","role of intensity","related zoonotic diseases","serological epidemiology of zoonotic diseases","incidental zoonoses","associated zoonoses","culling personnel","slaughterhouse workers","studies","little information","systematic review","different occupations","veterinarians","relationships","brief animal","limited evidence of exposure response","farm visits","current knowledge","developing countries","environmental exposures","ingestion","conjunctiva","co-workers","farmers","occupational settings","inhalation","BACKGROUND","hours","peer-reviewed publications","prevention","METHODS","options","RESULTS","papers","attention","carcasses","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

H7N9 originated with multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host response closer to that with human or avian IAV is important in order to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV. The transcriptomic response to H7N9 was highly specific to this strain but was more similar to the response to human H3N2 than to that to other avian IAVs. H7N9 and H3N2 both elicited responses related to eicosanoid signaling and chromatin modification, whereas H7N9 specifically induced genes regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Among avian IAVs, the response to H7N9 was closest to that elicited by H5N1 virus. Host responses common to H7N9 and the other avian viruses included the lack of induction of the antigen presentation pathway and reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction compared to that with H3N2. Repression of these responses could have an important impact on the immunogenicity and virulence of H7N9 in humans. Finally, using a genome-based drug repurposing approach, we identified several drugs predicted to regulate the host response to H7N9 that may act as potential antivirals, including several kinase inhibitors, as well as FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline. Importantly, we validated that minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication in vitro, suggesting that our computational approach holds promise for identifying novel antivirals.","publish_time":"2014-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Josset, Laurence; Zeng, Hui; Kelly, Sara M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfa1dab8c91f41f59df39489115a8b2e19e537bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3950506.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496798/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01102-13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virulence of H7N9","human H3N2","novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza","avian viruses","avian IAVs","minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication","human seasonal H3N2 IAV","transcriptomic response","host response closer","human lung epithelial cell response","pathogenic avian-origin H5N1","H5N1 virus","elicited responses","Host responses common","genetic markers of human adaptation","lethal human respiratory infections","novel antivirals","emerging virus","lack of induction","cell cycle","important impact","computational approach","potential antivirals","FDA-approved drugs","reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction","genome-based drug repurposing approach","H7N7","antigen presentation pathway","induced genes","multiple reassortment events","chromatin modification","immunogenicity","eicosanoid","order","kinase inhibitors","transcription","troglitazone","strain","humans","China","Anhui","Repression"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luong-Nguyen, Minh; Hermand, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Abdalla, Solafah; Cabrit, Nicolas; Hobeika, Christian; Brouquet, Antoine; Go\u00E9r\u00E9, Diane; Sauvanet, Alain","journal":"Journal de chirurgie viscerale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd6d0134533e6f16c1af6e275fa99fba40179861.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-Cov","risk of infection","series of patients","uninfected patients","risk of SARS","influx of hospital patients","days","diagnosis of SARS","evident nosocomial infection","digestive surgery services","departments of digestive surgery","post-hospitalization","surgical treatment of cancer","serious risk","order","safe surgical activity","treatment of complications","years","median time","median age","drastic reduction","pandemic","admission","non-interventional retrospective study","radiological data","COVID","women","complex emergencies","reasons","stoma closure","computerized medical record","work","Methods","Introduction","Measures","co-morbidities","end","follow-up","respiratory assistance","Conclusions","gastroplasty","virus","consequences","aim","Results"],"language":"en"},

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. OBJECTIVES: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords \u201CCOVID 19,\u201D \u201CSARS-CoV-2,\u201D and \u201Ctreatment.\u201D All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. DISCUSSION: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Glucocorticoids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. CONCLUSION: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Nikita; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Alkindi, Nour; Ali Pourmand","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5c44a121f896db119fc1b82d3391a5e13a2ca29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158837.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720302631?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336586/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720302631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","treatment guidelines","treatment options","label use of available therapies","limited evidence","best available evidence","hydroxychloroquine","therapeutic drugs available","available information","Current guidelines","clinical guidelines","potential therapies","evidence of cytokine release syndrome","critical patients","combination treatments","ACE inhibitors","lack of established therapies","literature review","narrative review","antimalarials","remdesivir","ARBs","antivirals","pandemic","SARS-CoV","limited availability","time","controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","evidence of refractory septic shock","ongoing clinical trials","acute respiratory distress syndrome","respiratory failure","case-studies","effectiveness of current therapy options","moderate disease","types of studies","angiotensin receptor blockers","rapid transmission of disease","ARDS","NSAIDs","azithromycin","prevention","systematic reviews","efficacy of single","world","CRS","enzyme","favipiravir","recommendations","convalescent plasma","new agents","resource","health care professionals","experiences of healthcare providers","development","compelling indication","access","biologics","ibuprofen","CONCLUSION","SCOPUS","OBJECTIVES","antagonists","purpose","INTRODUCTION","results","keywords","Interleukin","fever","PubMed","DISCUSSION","Glucocorticoids"],"language":"en"},

Most research has been focused on isolation, genome sequencing, pathogenicity, and virulence of these viruses, but there is little information on long-term growth performance and tissue accretion of pigs inoculated with PEDV or PDCoV. Therefore, our objective was to determine the effect of PEDV or PDCoV infection on growth performance and tissue accretion over 42 d following inoculation. A total of 75 Choice Genetics Large White Pureline barrows and gilts (BW = 10.81 \u00B1 0.81 kg) at approximately 2 wk post-wean and na\u00EFve for PEDV and PDCoV were selected. Pigs were allotted based on BW and sex, stratified across 3 treatments with 8 pens per treatment. Treatments were: 1) Control (n = 8); 2) PEDV inoculated (n = 8); and 3) PDCoV inoculated (n = 8). On day post inoculation (dpi) 2, 5, 7, and 14 pigs were euthanized for tissue collection and analyses from these tissues are discussed elsewhere. Pen feed intake and BW were recorded on dpi 2, 5, 7, and weekly thereafter until dpi 42. On 1 designated pig per pen, initial and final body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and tissue accretion rates were calculated over 6 wk test period. Peak PEDV infection was noted at 3 dpi compared with 4 dpi for PDCoV pigs as determined by fecal swab quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Control pigs remained negative for PEDV and PDCoV throughout the experiment. Overall, Control and PDCoV pigs did not differ in ADG, ADFI or G:F (P \u003E 0.05). Compared to Control and PDCoV pigs, the overall 42 d ADFI was reduced in the challenged PEDV pigs (P \u003C 0.05) by 19 and 27%, respectively. PEDV did not significantly reduce the overall ADG or G:F compared with Control and PDCoV pigs; however, the biggest reduction in ADG and ADFI for PEDV pigs was within 14 dpi compared to the Control pigs (P \u003C 0.05). Whole body tissue accretion was altered due to PED, with fat, lean, protein, and bone mineral accretion reductions by 24, 20, 21, and 42%, respectively (P \u003C 0.05) compared with Control pigs. Overall, nursery pig performance was greatly impacted by PEDV challenge. Surprisingly, the PDCoV challenge did not negatively influence nursery pig performance. This study provides further insight into the longitudinal impact swine enteric coronaviruses have on growing pigs.","publish_time":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curry, S. M.; Gibson, K.

However, isoelectric focusing of the S protein of these five ts mutants and the wt MHV-JHM, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose sheets and immunoblotting with anti-S specific antibody revealed significant differences in the microheterogeneity of the S protein.","publish_time":"1992-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oleszak, Emilia L.; Knisley, Keith; Rodkey, L.Scott; Leibowitz, Julian L.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/001259ae6d9bfa9376894f61aa6b6c5f18be2177.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016609349290173B; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016609349290173B","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wt MHV-JHM","mutants of MHV","S protein","ts MHV-JHM mutants","ts mutants","demyelinating disease","strain JHM","molecular weight of S peplomer protein of wt","cause fatal disease","anti-S specific antibody","strong demyelinating properties","surviving animals","significant differences","acute fatal encephalomyelitis","neurotropic coronavirus","wild type","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","nitrocellulose sheets","designated ts8","microheterogeneity","temperature-sensitive","demyelination","transfer","SDS-PAGE analysis","mortality","infected mice","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Transmission is believed to mainly occur in healthcare settings through aerosolized particles. This study uses Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to develop a generalizable model that can assist with interpreting reported outbreak data or predict risk of infection with or without the recommended strategies. The exposure scenario includes a single index patient emitting virus\u2010containing aerosols into the air by coughing, leading to short\u2010 and long\u2010range airborne exposures for other patients in the same room, nurses, healthcare workers, and family visitors. Aerosol transport modeling was coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the risk of MERS illness for the exposed population. Results from a typical scenario show the daily mean risk of infection to be the highest for the nurses and healthcare workers (8.49 \u00D7 10(\u22124) and 7.91 \u00D7 10(\u22124), respectively), and the lowest for family visitors and patients staying in the same room (3.12 \u00D7 10(\u22124) and 1.29 \u00D7 10(\u22124), respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicates that more than 90% of the uncertainty in the risk characterization is due to the viral concentration in saliva. Assessment of risk interventions showed that respiratory masks were found to have a greater effect in reducing the risks for all the groups evaluated (\u003E90% risk reduction), while increasing the air exchange was effective for the other patients in the same room only (up to 58% risk reduction).","publish_time":"2019-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adhikari, Umesh; Chabrelie, Alexandre; Weir, Mark; Boehnke, Kevin; McKenzie, Erica; Ikner, Luisa; Wang, Meng; Wang, Qing; Young, Kyana; Haas, Charles N.; Rose, Joan; Mitchell, Jade","journal":"Risk Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18a76b78fdb722fbd1dec71ce3365f8263e075a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524301/; https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13389","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment"],"locations":["Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["risk reduction","risk characterization","Assessment of risk interventions","risk of MERS illness","daily mean risk of infection","Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment","patients","room","healthcare workers","emerging viral infection","nurses","healthcare settings","family visitors","viral concentration","typical scenario","respiratory masks","exposure scenario","air exchange","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome","single index patient","global case fatality rate","Monte Carlo simulation","aerosols","virus","interpreting","generalizable model","Aerosol transport modeling","long\u2010range airborne exposures","study","outbreak data","exposed population","risks","coughing","aerosolized particles","greater effect","saliva","Results","recommended strategies","groups","uncertainty","new cases","major outbreaks","Sensitivity analysis","world","Transmission"],"language":"en"},

Custom-made measures based on individual farm characteristics may aid in improving the actual application of on-farm biosecurity. The aim of the study was to provide a tool for calculating the effects of different biosecurity measures and strategies on the individual farm level. A simple model was developed to assess the risk of disease introduction and the need for biosecurity measures in individual farms. To illustrate the general applicability of the tool, it was applied to theoretical examples of Swedish cattle and pig farms and diseases endemic in those animal species in the EU, in two scenarios with different between-farm contact patterns. RESULTS: The model illustrated that the most important factors affecting the risk, and the effect of biosecurity measures such as quarantine routines and protective clothing, were the frequency of between-farm contacts and prevalence of the disease. The risk of introduction as well as the effect of biosecurity measures differed between farm types and disease transmission routes. Adapting contact patterns to mitigate a specific disease risk was as important as biosecurity measures for some farm types, but the largest effect was seen when combining biosecurity measures with more planned contact patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The risk assessment model proved useful for illustrating the risk of introduction of endemic diseases and the mitigating effect of different biosecurity measures on farm level. Model outputs could be used to justify prioritisation of measures or adapting contact patterns. The theoretic exercise of adjusting model inputs and comparing outputs may help veterinary advisors to understand farm-specific risks and motivate farmers to improve biosecurity in their individual farm, as it can be tailored to each farmer\u2019s needs and preferences.","publish_time":"2015-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewerin, Susanna Sternberg; \u00D6sterberg, Julia; Alenius, Stefan; Elvander, Marianne; Fellstr\u00F6m, Claes; Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, Madeleine; Wallgren, Per; Waller, Karin Persson; Jacobson, Magdalena","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbbb49ef360b3f97d6ecda042ef75186a78ddfa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4515931.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0477-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["farm biosecurity","effect of biosecurity measures","effects of different biosecurity measures","Biosecurity routines","farm types","farm contact patterns","individual farm level","mitigating effect of different biosecurity measures","prioritisation of measures","Custom-made measures","farm contacts","individual farm characteristics","risk of disease introduction","risk of introduction","farm-specific risks","specific disease risk","risk assessment model","Model outputs","Adapting contact patterns","individual farms","planned contact patterns","model inputs","simple model","largest effect","herd level","probability of introduction","disease transmission routes","diseases endemic","endemic diseases","farmers","tool","pig farms","quarantine routines","important factors","strategies","theoretical examples of Swedish cattle","veterinary advisors","protective clothing","animal species","EU","frequency","scenarios","BACKGROUND","actual application","theoretic exercise","CONCLUSIONS","prevalence","farmer\u2019s needs","preferences","study","general applicability","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The dataset for different MHC class I alleles for SARS Corona virus (Tor2 Replicase polyprotein 1ab) has been used for training and prediction of BNB. A total of 90 datasets (nine different MHC class I alleles with tenfold cross validation) have been retrieved from IEDB database for BNB.

Rapid and efficient detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns via pattern-recognition receptors is essential for the host to mount defensive and protective responses. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is critical in triggering antiviral and inflammatory responses for the control of viral replication in response to cytoplasmic virus-specific RNA structures. Upon viral RNA recognition, RIG-I recruits the mitochondrial adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, which leads to a signaling cascade that coordinates the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), as well as a large variety of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. The RIG-I activation is tightly regulated via various posttranslational modifications for the prevention of aberrant innate immune signaling. By contrast, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, such as sequestrating viral structures from RIG-I detections and targeting receptor or signaling molecules for degradation. These virus\u2013host interactions have broadened our understanding of viral pathogenesis and provided insights into the function of the RIG-I pathway. In this review, we summarize the recent advances regarding RIG-I pathogen recognition and signaling transduction, cell-intrinsic control of RIG-I activation, and the viral antagonism of RIG-I signaling.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yiliu; Olagnier, David; Lin, Rongtuan","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37bc284af4f2f731792f44339253abc79c6d2782.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5206486.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Retinoic"],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral antagonism of RIG","viral RNA recognition","cell-intrinsic control of RIG","control of viral replication","sequestrating viral structures","pathogen recognition","understanding of viral pathogenesis","mitochondrial adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral","triggering antiviral","activation","pattern-recognition receptors","cytoplasmic virus-specific RNA structures","inflammatory responses","host interactions","protective responses","Innate immunity","efficient detection of pathogen","large variety of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes","prevention of aberrant innate immune","molecular patterns","evolved mechanisms of evasion","transduction","insights","detections","various posttranslational modifications","line of defense","recent advances","induction of type","viruses","function","Retinoic acid-inducible gene","interferons","IFNs","invading pathogens","contrast","molecules","degradation","cascade","review","pathway"],"language":"en"},

This study describes the clinical features and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized patients in Egypt. METHODS: SARI surveillance was implemented at Cairo University Hospital (CUH) during the period 2010\u20132014. All hospitalized patients meeting the WHO case definition for SARI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs were collected and samples were tested using RT-PCR for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1,2,3,4), adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and atypical bacteria. Data were analyzed to calculate positivity rates for viral pathogens and determine which pathogens related to severe outcomes or resulted in death. RESULTS: Overall, 1,075/3,207 (33.5%) cases had a viral etiology, with a mean age of 5.74 (\u00B113.87) years. The highest rates were reported for RSV (485 cases, 45.2%), PIV (125, 11.6%), and adenovirus (105, 9.8%). Children had a higher viral rate (981, 91.2%) compared to 94 (8.8%) cases in adults. Patients with identified viruses had significantly lower rates for ICU admission, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, and overall mortality than those without identified viruses. No infections were independently associated with severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens were encountered in one-third of hospitalized adult and pediatric Egyptian patients with SARI, while atypical bacteria had a minor role. Highest rates of viral infections were reported for RSV, PIV, and adenovirus. Viral infections had neither negative impacts on clinical features nor outcomes of patients with SARI in our locality.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatem, Ashraf; Mohamed, Sherif; Abu Elhassan, Usama E.; Ismael, Eman A.

There is also a lack of studies comparing clinical characteristics of the non-influenza pathogens with influenza and amongst themselves. METHODS: From May 2009 through October 2012, 7733 consenting cases of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) (temperature [greater than or equal to]37.5degreesC with cough or sorethroat) and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal washes collected prospectively. Nasal washes underwent multiplex PCR, and the analysis was limited to viral mono-infections. RESULTS: 49% of cases tested positive for at least one virus, of whom 10% had multiple infections. 53% of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), of whom 52% were positive for at least one virus. The most frequent etiologies for mono-infections among FRI cases were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (13%), Influenza B (13%) and coxsackevirus (9%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of ILI for influenza among FRI cases were 72%, 48%, 40% and 69% respectively. On logistic regression, there were marked differences in the prevalence of different symptoms and signs between viruses with fever more prevalent amongst influenza and adenovirus infections than other viruses. CONCLUSION: There are multiple viral etiologies for FRI and ILI with differing clinical symptoms in the Singapore military. Influenza and coxsackevirus were the most common etiology for FRI, while influenza and adenoviruses displayed the most febrile symptoms. Further studies should explore these differences and possible interventions.","publish_time":"2014-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Xin Quan; Zhao, Xiahong; Lee, Vernon J; Loh, Jin Phang; Tan, Boon Huan; Koh, Wee Hong Victor; Ng, Sock Hoon; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Cook, Alex Richard","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3330a6e81c27b196cb5171baf11239a9560ff6e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4006965.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["definition of influenza","Influenza B","non-influenza pathogens","multiple infections","viral mono-infections","Singapore military","febrile symptoms","adenovirus infections","consenting cases of febrile respiratory illness","positive predictive value","differing clinical symptoms","negative predictive value of ILI","clinical characteristics","clinical data","military populations","differences","nasal washes","multiple viral etiologies","lack of studies","coxsackevirus","prevalence of different symptoms","frequent etiologies","tropical respiratory disease surveillance","signs","fever","specificity","controls","cough","sorethroat","temperature","multiplex PCR","analysis","sensitivity","common etiology","degreesC","CONCLUSION","H1N1","adenoviruses","pdm09","possible interventions","logistic regression","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, the exact mechanism and receptors used by HPV to infect epithelial cells are controversial. The current entry model suggests that HPV initially attaches to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the cell surface, followed by conformational changes, cleavage by furin convertase, and subsequent transfer of the virus to an as-yet-unidentified high-affinity receptor. In line with this model, we established an in vitro infection system using the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677 together with HPV16 pseudovirions (HPV16-PsVs). While pgsD677 cells were nonpermissive for untreated HPV16-PsVs, furin cleavage of the particles led to a substantial increase in infection. Biochemical pulldown assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that furin-precleaved HPV16-PsVs specifically interacted with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677 cells. We further demonstrated that both furin-precleaved and uncleaved HPV16-PsVs colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells, while binding of incoming viral particles to soluble vimentin protein before infection led to a substantial decrease in viral uptake. Interestingly, decreasing cell surface vimentin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in HeLa and NIKS cells significantly increased HPV16-PsV infectious internalization, while overexpression of vimentin had the opposite effect. The identification of vimentin as an HPV restriction factor enhances our understanding of the initial steps of HPV-host interaction and may lay the basis for the design of novel antiviral drugs preventing HPV internalization into epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Despite HPV being a highly prevalent sexually transmitted virus causing significant disease burden worldwide, particularly cancer of the cervix, cell surface events preceding oncogenic HPV internalization are poorly understood. We herein describe the identification of surface-expressed vimentin as a novel molecule not previously implicated in the infectious internalization of HPV16. Contrary to our expectations, vimentin was found to act not as a receptor but rather as a restriction factor dampening the initial steps of HPV16 infection. These results importantly contribute to our current understanding of the molecular events during the infectious internalization of HPV16 and open a new direction in the development of alternative drugs to prevent HPV infection.","publish_time":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00E4fer, Georgia; Graham, Lisa M.; Lang, Dirk M.; Blumenthal, Melissa J.; Bergant Maru\u0161i\u010D, Martina; Katz, Arieh A.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e0759e9f0c620a14bac6b9939d66bf18847de9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5533935.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00307-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","NIKS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV infection","cell surface vimentin","infectious internalization of HPV16","oncogenic HPV internalization","initial steps of HPV16 infection","HPV16 pseudovirions","pgsD677 cells","identification of vimentin","furin-precleaved HPV16-PsVs","untreated HPV16-PsVs","uncleaved HPV16-PsVs","overexpression of vimentin","infection system","HPV restriction factor","cell surface events","NIKS cells","common viral infection","epithelial cells","identification of surface","increased HPV16-PsV infectious internalization","soluble vimentin protein","furin cleavage","furin convertase","HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677","HeLa","incoming viral particles","viral uptake","current understanding","current entry model","molecular events","design of novel antiviral drugs","transmitted virus","oncogenic HPVs","substantial decrease","novel molecule","substantial increase","development of alternative drugs","cases of cervical cancer","unidentified high-affinity receptor","small interfering RNA","knockdown","siRNA","mass spectrometry analysis","conformational changes","significant disease burden","basis","reproductive tract","HSPGs","new direction","host interaction","Biochemical pulldown assays","cervix","HaCaT","nonpermissive","subsequent transfer","heparan sulfate proteoglycans","receptors","opposite effect","exact mechanism","Human papillomavirus","results","expectations","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, encodes a deubiquitinase (DUB) and inactivates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) thereby the type I interferon (IFN) response. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we provide further evidence that PLP2 may also target TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), the upstream kinase of IRF3 in the IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression experiments showed that PLP2 deubiquitinated TBK1 and reduced its kinase activity, hence inhibited IFN-\u03B2 reporter activity. Albeit promiscuous in deubiquitinating cellular proteins, PLP2 inactivated TBK1 and IFN-\u03B2 response in TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) deficient cells, suggesting that targeting TBK1 would be sufficient for PLP2 to inhibit IRF3 activation. This notion was further supported by in vitro kinase assays, in which prior treatment of TBK1 with PLP2 inhibited its kinase activity to phosphorylate IRF3. Intriguing enough, results of PLP2 overexpression system and MHV-A59 infection system proved that PLP2 formed an inactive complex with TBK1 and IRF3 in the cytoplasm and the presence of PLP2 stabilized the hypo-phosphorylated IRF3-TBK1 complex in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PLP2 not only inactivates TBK1, but also prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation hence inhibits IFN transcription activation. Identification of the conserved DUB activity of PLP2 in suppression of IFN signaling would provide a useful clue to the development of therapeutics against coronaviruses infection.","publish_time":"2011-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Gang; Chen, Gang; Zheng, Dahai; Cheng, Genhong; Tang, Hong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfb06153bd9db651c6c7c268aecf6e65113fe008.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3041802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364999/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP2 inactivated TBK1","PLP2 deubiquitinated TBK1","presence of PLP2","results of PLP2 overexpression system","conserved DUB activity of PLP2","kinase activity","IRF3 activation","upstream kinase of IRF3","suppression of IFN","hypo-phosphorylated IRF3-TBK1 complex","IFN-\u03B2 response","IFN regulatory factor","prior treatment of TBK1","IFN transcription activation","MHV-A59 infection system","inhibited IFN-\u03B2 reporter activity","IRF3 nuclear translocation","kinase assays","coronaviruses infection","TANK-binding kinase","mouse hepatitis virus A59","innate immune system","inactive complex","Overexpression experiments","catalytic domain","protease domain","SCoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome","deubiquitinating cellular proteins","SARS","TNF receptor","TRAF3","development of therapeutics","productive replication","strategies","nonstructural protein","useful clue","nsp3","dose-dependent manner","deficient cells","type","interferon","deubiquitinase","cytoplasm","BACKGROUND","evidence","Identification","Intriguing","papain","CONCLUSIONS","pathway","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","notion"],"language":"en"},

Previously, the extra domain was demonstrated to regulate the catalysis of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro by controlling its dimerization. Here, we studied N214A, another mutant with only a doubled dissociation constant but significantly abolished activity. Unexpectedly, N214A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Thus, we conducted 30-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for N214A, WT, and R298A which we previously characterized to be a monomer with the collapsed catalytic machinery. Remarkably, three proteases display distinctive dynamical behaviors. While in WT, the catalytic machinery stably retains in the activated state; in R298A it remains largely collapsed in the inactivated state, thus implying that two states are not only structurally very distinguishable but also dynamically well separated. Surprisingly, in N214A the catalytic dyad becomes dynamically unstable and many residues constituting the catalytic machinery jump to sample the conformations highly resembling those of R298A. Therefore, the N214A mutation appears to trigger the dramatic change of the enzyme dynamics in the context of the dimeric form which ultimately inactivates the catalytic machinery. The present MD simulations represent the longest reported so far for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, unveiling that its catalysis is critically dependent on the dynamics, which can be amazingly modulated by the extra domain. Consequently, mediating the dynamics may offer a potential avenue to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","publish_time":"2011-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Jiahai; Han, Nanyu; Lim, Liangzhong; Lua, Shixiong; Sivaraman, J.; Wang, Lushan; Mu, Yuguang; Song, Jianxing","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d68205dc527d5f0ee5a9ece74f3e7a7b22af8402.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3044768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21390281/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collapsed catalytic machinery","CLpro","catalytic dyad","enzyme dynamics","SARS-CoV","WT","N214A mutation","extra domain","R298A","C proteases","extra helical domain","ns molecular dynamics","catalysis","present MD simulations","dimeric form","dimeric structure","inactivated state","dramatic change","doubled dissociation constant","mutant","context","residues","coronavirus","wild-type","potential avenue","activity","distinctive dynamical behaviors","evolution","picornavirus","chymotrypsin fold","monomer","conformations","states","dimerization"],"language":"en"},

All combinations of three factors (inoculation with S. choleraesuis on Day 0, PRRSV on Day 3, and treatment with dexamethasone on Days 3\u20137) were used to produce eight treatment groups in two independent trials. Fecal samples, tonsil and nasal swabs, serum samples and postmortem tissues were collected for bacteriologic and virologic examinations. No clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with only PRRSV or only S. choleraesuis. In contrast, pigs which were dually infected with S. choleraesuis and PRRSV exhibited unthriftiness, rough hair coats, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The pigs which received all three treatment factors were the most severely affected and 43% (three of seven) of the animals in this group died. Individuals in this group shed significantly higher quantities of S. choleraesuis in feces and had significantly higher serum PRRSV titers compared to other treatments (p \u22640.05). In addition, S. choleraesuis and PRRSV were shed longer and by more pigs in this group than other groups and S. choleraesuis was recovered from more tissues in this group on Day 21 post inoculation.

The disease is characterized by increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence; the most commonly associated pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae express virulence determinants that directly and indirectly impair mucociliary clearance and incite other consequences that are permissive to microbial persistence. Regarding the use of antibiotics, there is currently a lack of large-scale clinical trials that are sufficiently powerful to provide good evidence-based information. Nonetheless, antimicrobial chemotherapy has repeatedly been shown to confer benefit in patients with moderately severe features of AECB. Simple clinical criteria can be used to identify patients in whom there is a higher likelihood of treatment failure or mortality during AECB. These include significant cardiopulmonary co-morbidity, frequent exacerbations, advanced decline in lung function, malnutrition or other generalized debility, advanced age (\u003E 70 years) and concurrent treatment with corticosteroids. In such patients, an aggressive antimicrobial approach to AECB may be warranted in order to prevent clinical failure or representation. From a clinical perspective, appropriate drugs include those that are stable to \u03B2-lactamases, are bactericidal against causative pathogens, penetrate diseased lung tissue in high concentrations and have a good safety profile.","publish_time":"1999-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Read, R.

The building unit needs to be both multivalent and anisotropic, and although many anisotropic building blocks have been created(1,8,9,10,11,12), these have not been universally applicable. Recently, DNA has been used to generate various nanostructures(13,14,15,16,17) or hybrid systems(18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25), and as a generic building block for various applications(26,27,28,29,30).

In particular, we demonstrate a target-driven polymerization process in which polymers are generated only in the presence of a specific DNA molecule, leading to highly sensitive pathogen detection. Using this monomer system, we have also designed a biocompatible nanovector that delivers both drugs and tracers simultaneously.

The aim of the present study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of such a scale. Forty nine items were derived from interviews with 29 nurses and tested across two studies. Study 1 was a repeated\u2010measures survey using principal components analysis with data from 363 participants; a 29 item, five factor solution was extracted with good to acceptable internal reliabilities (\u03B1 = .61\u2013.85). Data from 122 of the original participants retested at 4 weeks showed intraclass correlations of .69\u2013.84. Study 2, which was 6 months later, used confirmatory factor analysis with data from a second sample of 384 participants, and supported the five factor structure of leadership, justification, culture/practice, contextual cues, and judgement. The Factors Influencing Adherence to Standard Precautions Scale has good psychometric properties and stability across time and samples. The scale is suitable for use with nurses, and its validation with other health\u2010care professionals and trainees is important in order to tailor effective interventions to promote adherence.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouchoucha, St\u00E9phane L.; Moore, Kathleen A.","journal":"Nurs Health Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08ab0d298d02ae76e630bd8712f4c190e9b8fdfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159402.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/nhs.12578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Precautions","Standard Precautions Scale"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health","Standard Precautions Scale","workers\u0027 adherence","care professionals","validated scale","data collection","sociocognitive determinants of adherence","care settings","good psychometric properties","confirmatory factor analysis","factor solution","original participants","nurses","present study","factor structure of leadership","mandated use of standard precaution guidelines","principal components analysis","infection transmission","practice","culture","justification","measures survey","stability","order","time","trainees","validation","contextual cues","acceptable internal reliabilities","weeks","effective interventions","influences","months","Factors","judgement","samples","questionnaire","intraclass correlations","interviews","aim","Michinov","items","studies"],"language":"en"},

HCoVs are globally distributed and the predominant species may vary by region or year. Prior studies have shown seasonal patterns of HCoV species and annual variation in species prevalence but national circulation patterns in the US have not yet been described. Objectives To describe circulation patterns of HCoVs -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 in the US. Study design We reviewed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test results for HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 reported to The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) by U.S. laboratories from July 2014\u2013June 2017. We calculated the total number of tests and percent positive by week. For a subset of HCoV positive submissions with age and sex of the patient available, we tested for differences in age and sex across the four HCoV species using Chi Square and Kruskal Wallace tests. Results 117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests; 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of positive tests peaked during December \u2013 March each year. No significant differences in sex were seen across species, although a significant difference in age distribution was noted. Conclusions Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual HCoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. Different HCoV species may be detected more frequently in different age groups. Further years of data are needed to better understand patterns of activity for HCoVs.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Killerby, Marie E.; Biggs, Holly M.; Haynes, Amber; Dahl, Rebecca M.; Mustaquim, Desiree; Gerber, Susan I.; Watson, John T.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d426c3dfc0f958f0b70faaed6be773efce5517bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106380.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300325; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["HCoV tests","HCoV-HKU1","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-NL63","Different HCoV species","seasonal patterns of HCoV species","circulation patterns of HCoVs","subset of HCoV positive submissions","species prevalence","predominant species","individual HCoVs","national circulation patterns","sex","percentage of positive tests","Conclusions Common HCoVs","variable circulation","percent positive","patterns of activity","age distribution","annual peaks of circulation","different age groups","HKU1 cause upper","Kruskal Wallace tests","total number of tests","significant differences","laboratories","annual variation","test results","lower respiratory tract infections","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","rRT-PCR","Enteric Virus Surveillance System","Chi Square","winter months","NREVSS","Study design","Abstract Background Human coronaviruses","patient available","Prior studies","week","region","Objectives","years of data"],"language":"en"},

The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramanathan, Kollengode; Antognini, David; Combes, Alain; Paden, Matthew; Zakhary, Bishoy; Ogino, Mark; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel; Shekar, Kiran","journal":"Lancet Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23a62c1bffd5b46d2123bf6b4c16164afccf6f75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32203711/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260020301211; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213260020301211; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECMO access","ECMO preparedness","venovenous ECMO","expert ECMO centre","ECMO action plan","eligible patients","ill patients","selected patients","number of patients","COVID","severe ARDS","specialised centres","respiratory-related mortality","complex therapies","specialist centres","complex therapeutic interventions","acute respiratory distress syndrome","strict infection control measures","crucial components","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","training of personnel","equipment","judicious resource allocation","similar patient populations","coordinated movement","maximal medical management","high transmission rate","interim guidelines","view","staff","unique challenges","level of support","Careful planning","Available evidence","pandemic","use","coronavirus disease","systems","Summary","procedure","transportation","conventional treatment","need"],"language":"en"},

Work over the last few decades has yielded a wealth of biochemical and structural information on the functional regulation of P2, on its role in the spatiotemporal regulation of RNA synthesis and its variability across the Cystoviridae family. These range from atomic resolution snapshots of P2 trapped in functionally significant states, in complex with catalytic/structural metal ions, polynucleotide templates and substrate nucleoside triphosphates, to P2 in the context of viral capsids providing structural insight into the assembly of supramolecular complexes and regulatory interactions therein. They include in vitro biochemical studies using P2 purified to homogeneity and in vivo studies utilizing infectious core particles. Recent advances in experimental techniques have also allowed access to the temporal dimension and enabled the characterization of dynamics of P2 on the sub-nanosecond to millisecond timescale through measurements of nuclear spin relaxation in solution and single molecule studies of transcription from seconds to minutes.

Thus, energy and carbon dioxide emission reduction is becoming more significant in the sustainability of urban transportation systems. However, urban transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO2 emissions.","publish_time":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yung-Hsiang; Chang, Yu-Hern; Lu, I.

Viruses have evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms for interacting with the host cell machinery, and recent evidence indicates that this also involves RNAi pathways. The cellular RNAi machinery can inhibit virus replication, but viruses may also exploit the RNAi machinery for their own replication. In addition, viruses can encode proteins or RNA molecules that suppress existing RNAi pathways or trigger the silencing of specific host genes.

Objectives The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical use of a novel multiplex PCR method in adults with community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the impact of duration of symptoms on detection rates. Study design Nasopharyngeal swab samples were prospectively collected from 209 adult outpatients with respiratory infections and 100 asymptomatic controls. Results An infectious agent was identified in 43% of samples from patients and 2% of asymptomatic controls. The detection rate was significantly higher in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 6 days or less (51%) than in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 7 days or more (30%, p \u003C0.01). For human corona viruses, and influenza virus A and B there was a correlation between the amount of virus in each patient sample as measured Ct values and duration of symptoms. Conclusions Duration of symptoms significantly affects the detection rate of respiratory pathogens by multiplex real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples from adult patients with respiratory infections.

More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.","publish_time":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suchodolski, J.

It has been previously shown that HCoV-NL63 is also one of the most important causes of croup in children. In the current manuscript we developed a set of polymer-based compounds showing prominent anticoronaviral activity. Polymers have been recently considered as promising alternatives to small molecule inhibitors, due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and ability to serve as matrices for antimicrobial compounds. Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. A cationically modified chitosan derivative, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and hydrophobically-modified HTCC were shown to be potent inhibitors of HCoV-NL63 replication. Furthermore, both compounds showed prominent activity against murine hepatitis virus, suggesting broader anticoronaviral activity.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milewska, Aleksandra; Ciejka, Justyna; Kaminski, Kamil; Karewicz, Anna; Bielska, Dorota; Zeglen, Slawomir; Karolak, Wojciech; Nowakowska, Maria; Potempa, Jan; Bosch, Berend Jan; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Szczubialka, Krzysztof","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb3db4a5280d9b195092f4e7539da45818e7bfcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114096.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.11.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201315/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212002616; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212002616","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prominent activity","antimicrobial compounds","prominent anticoronaviral activity","antiviral activity","antimicrobial polymers","HCoV-NL63","broader anticoronaviral activity","children","based compounds","intrinsic antimicrobial properties","NL63 replication","potent inhibitors of HCoV","hydrophobically-modified HTCC","human coronavirus NL63","antibacterial properties","cationically modified chitosan derivative","small molecule inhibitors","trimethylammonium chitosan chloride","murine hepatitis virus","set of polymer","severe lower respiratory tract diseases","infection","patients","ability","promising alternatives","underlying disease","matrices","common cold pathogen","important causes of croup","hydroxypropyl","current manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Herein we describe a cohort of 57 patients (age 18\u201368 years) with secondary syphilis (SS) identified through a network of public sector primary health care providers in Cali, Colombia. To be eligible for participation, study subjects were required to have cutaneous lesions consistent with SS, a reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR-titer \u22651\u22364), and a confirmatory treponemal test (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test- FTA-ABS). Most subjects enrolled were women (64.9%), predominantly Afro-Colombian (38.6%) or mestizo (56.1%), and all were of low socio-economic status. Three (5.3%) subjects were newly diagnosed with HIV infection at study entry. The duration of signs and symptoms in most patients (53.6%) was less than 30 days; however, some patients reported being symptomatic for several months (range 5\u2013240 days). The typical palmar and plantar exanthem of SS was the most common dermal manifestation (63%), followed by diffuse hypo- or hyperpigmented macules and papules on the trunk, abdomen and extremities. Three patients had patchy alopecia. Whole blood (WB) samples and punch biopsy material from a subset of SS patients were assayed for the presence of Tp DNA polymerase I gene (polA) target by real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR methods. Twelve (46%) of the 26 WB samples studied had quantifiable Tp DNA (ranging between 194.9 and 1954.2 Tp polA copies/ml blood) and seven (64%) were positive when WB DNA was extracted within 24 hours of collection. Tp DNA was also present in 8/12 (66%) skin biopsies available for testing. Strain typing analysis was attempted in all skin and WB samples with detectable Tp DNA. Using arp repeat size analysis and tpr RFLP patterns four different strain types were identified (14d, 16d, 13d and 22a). None of the WB samples had sufficient DNA for typing. The clinical and microbiologic observations presented herein, together with recent Cali syphilis seroprevalence data, provide additional evidence that venereal syphilis is highly endemic in this region of Colombia, thus underscoring the need for health care providers in the region to be acutely aware of the clinical manifestations of SS. This study also provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence that a significant proportion of untreated SS patients have substantial numbers of circulating spirochetes. How Tp is able to persist in the blood and skin of SS patients, despite the known presence of circulating treponemal opsonizing antibodies and the robust pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses characteristic of this stage of the disease, is not fully understood and requires further study.","publish_time":"2010-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Adriana R.; Pillay, Allan; Zuluaga, Ana V.; Ramirez, Lady G.; Duque, Jorge E.; Aristizabal, Gloria E.; Fiel-Gan, Mary D.; Jaramillo, Roberto; Trujillo, Rodolfo; Valencia, Carlos; Jagodzinski, Linda; Cox, David L.; Radolf, Justin D.; Salazar, Juan C.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2246e28681bde69c65dc9081df367bb661997f19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2872645.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20502522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Treponema"],"organizations":["SS","Rapid Plasma Reagin","WB"],"locations":["Colombia"],"keyphrases":["WB DNA","skin of SS patients","subset of SS patients","detectable Tp DNA","quantifiable Tp DNA","WB samples","presence of Tp DNA polymerase","sufficient DNA","study subjects","Tp polA copies","significant proportion of untreated SS patients","Venereal syphilis","blood","plantar exanthem of SS","secondary syphilis","study entry","confirmatory treponemal test","quantitative evidence","region of Colombia","typing","days","recent Cali syphilis seroprevalence data","Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test- FTA","known presence of circulating treponemal opsonizing antibodies","skin biopsies available","additional evidence","multi-stage","size analysis","transmitted disease","clinical manifestations of","network of public sector primary health care providers","reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin test","different strain types","quantitative PCR methods","substantial numbers of circulating spirochetes","robust pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses characteristic","tpr RFLP patterns","target","gene","punch biopsy material","spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum","trunk","papules","hyperpigmented macules","RPR-titer","cutaneous lesions consistent","years","arp","months","HIV infection","need","diffuse hypo","common dermal manifestation","abdomen","range","testing","time","symptoms","participation","microbiologic observations","duration of signs","low socio-economic status","extremities","hours of collection","patchy alopecia","cohort","Afro-Colombian","mestizo","women"],"language":"en"},

We sought to discover proteins differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from mice infected with MHV-68. Mice were infected intranasally with MHV-68. After nine days, as the lytic phase of infection resolved, differential BAL proteins were identified by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Of 23 unique proteins, acute phase proteins, vitamin A transport, and oxidative stress response factors Pdx6 and EC-SOD (Sod3) were enriched. Correspondingly, iNOS2 was induced in lung tissue by seven days post-infection. Oxidative stress was partly a direct result of MHV-68 infection, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in cultured murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human lung A549 cells infected with MHV-68. Finally, mice infected with a recombinant MHV-68 co-expressing inflammatory cytokine murine interleukin 6 (IL6) showed exacerbated oxidative stress and soluble type I collagen characteristic of tissue recovery. Thus, oxidative stress appears to be a salient feature of MHV-68 pathogenesis, in part caused by lytic replication of the virus and IL6.

Virucidal activity of agents correlated with anti-JEV activity, while virucidal IC(50) values were 7.58 \u03BCg/ml for methanol extract, 17.36 \u03BCg/ml for water extract, 0.75 \u03BCg/ml for chrysophanol and 0.46 \u03BCg/ml for aloe-emodin, respectively. In addition, 10 \u03BCg/ml of extract, chrysophanol or aloe emodin caused 90 % inhibition of JEV yields in cells and significantly activated gamma activated sequence-driven promoters. Hence, methanol extract of R. palmatum and chrysophanol with high therapeutic index might be useful for development of antiviral agents against JEV.","publish_time":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Shu-Jen; Huang, Su-Hua; Lin, Ying-Ju; Tsou, Yi-Yun; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Arch Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97adff711db916914190dd5fde9ec4923a13f46d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12272-013-0325-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IC","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCg","Methanol extract of","water extract","chrysophanol","aloe-emodin","anti-JEV activity","JEV plaque reduction","inhibition of JEV","virucidal IC","higher levels of aloe emodin","palmatum extracts","Rheum palmatum","Virucidal activity of agents","values","study rates antiviral activity of","anti-viruses properties","plaque reduction assay","development of antiviral agents","great variety of anti-cancer","components","Chinese traditional herb","rhein","high therapeutic index","potent inhibitory effects","Japanese encephalitis virus","physcion","gamma","cells","sequence-driven promoters","addition"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs. Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Akriti; Shaikh, Altamash; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9962b3791dcb49f7801b5d1827fd90a3f760d0d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102587.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247211/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300515; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["COVID","experimental drugs","HCQ","clinical use","India","treatment of diabetes","AIMS","long experience of use","significant improvement","significant mortality","related guidelines","view of recent studies","small human studies","worthy of fast track clinical trial","diseases","discussion","cost-effectiveness","relevant websites","minimal risk","easy availability","parameters","patients","hydroxychloroquine","adverse effects","existing literature","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","subgroup","Coronavirus Disease","articles","BACKGROUND","PubMed database","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Viruses do not conservatively occupy a single and permanent ecological niche. Rather, due to their intrinsic capacity for genetic change, and to the evolvability of fitness levels, viruses display a potential to parasitize alternative host species. Mutation, recombination and genome segment reassortment, and combination of these molecular events, produce complex and phenotypically diverse populations of viruses, which constitute the raw material on which selection acts. The majority of emerging viral diseases of humans have a zoonotic origin. Sociologic and ecologic factors produce diverse and changing environments in which viral subpopulations have ample opportunities to be selected from intrinsically heterogeneous viral populations, particularly in the case of RNA viruses. In this manner, new human, animal and plant viruses have emerged periodically and, from all evidence, will continue to emerge. This article reviews some of the mechanisms that have been identified in viral emergence, with a focus on the importance of genetic variation of viruses, and on the general concept of biological complexity.","publish_time":"2010-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/105b993dee9f9e44637daa2d43e66f3ba3039fbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2831534.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1051/vetres/2010010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plant viruses","viral emergence","diverse populations of viruses","viral subpopulations","case of RNA viruses","heterogeneous viral populations","importance of genetic variation of viruses","re-emergence of viral disease","majority of emerging viral diseases of humans","genetic change","environmental factors","ecologic factors","potential","environments","genome segment reassortment","new human","animal","focus","evolvability of fitness levels","Mutation","recombination","molecular events","ample opportunities","raw material","general concept of biological complexity","zoonotic origin","alternative host species","permanent ecological niche","selection acts","manner","intrinsic capacity","number of virologic","mechanisms","article reviews","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and is a major target for PEDV neutralization and vaccine development. To understand the antigenicity of the new PEDV variant, we characterized the neutralizing epitopes of a new genotype 2b PEDV isolate from Taiwan, PEDV Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT), by the generation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs). Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1\u201310 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575\u2013639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1\u201310 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435\u2013485 within the S1(A) domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chia-Yu; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Chang, Yen-Chen; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Lai, Seiu-Yu; Huang, Yu-Liang; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Pang, Victor Fei; Chang, Hui-Wen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f93f20813c626fb775bbb73b1c14c906cd61e899.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6385244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792462/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39844-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV Pintung","PEDV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["b PEDV","glycoprotein of PEDV","PEDV neutralization","PEDV Pintung","PEDV-PT virus","new PEDV variant","full-length recombinant PEDV S protein","NmAbs","novel neutralizing epitope","linearized S proteins","neutralizing ability","multiple neutralizing epitopes","Recombinant truncated S proteins","equivalent epitope","conformational epitopes","P4B","E10E","future development of novel epitope-based vaccines","major target","vaccine development","target sequences","new genotype","identified variants of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","Taiwan","COE","antigenic structures","neonatal piglets","high mortality","generation","ectodomain","importance","amino acids","understanding","C-terminus","monoclonal antibodies","antigenicity","function","spike","swine industry","data","S1"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and \u2013KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and -229E among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). METHODS: Multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on archived nasopharyngeal aspirates from HIV-infected and \u2013uninfected children (\u003C2 years age) hospitalized for LRTI, who had been previously investigated for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I\u2013III, adenovirus and influenza A/B. RESULTS: At least one of these viruses were identified in 274 (53.0%) of 517 and in 509 (54.0%) of 943 LRTI-episodes in HIV-infected and -uninfected children, respectively. Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent in HIV-infected (31.7%) and \u2013uninfected children (32.0%), followed by CoV-OC43 (12.2%) and hBoV (9.5%) in HIV-infected; and by hBoV (13.3%) and WUPyV (11.9%) in HIV-uninfected children. Polyomavirus-KI (8.9% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.002) and CoV-OC43 (12.2% vs. 3.6%; p\u003C0.001) were more prevalent in HIV-infected than \u2013uninfected children. Combined with previously-tested viruses, respiratory viruses were identified in 60.9% of HIV-infected and 78.3% of HIV-uninfected children. The newly tested viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses, including previously-investigated viruses (22.8% in HIV-infected and 28.5% in HIV\u2013uninfected children). CONCLUSIONS: We established that combined with previously-investigated viruses, at least one respiratory virus was identified in the majority of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTI. The high frequency of viral co-infections illustrates the complexities in attributing causality to specific viruses in the aetiology of LRTI and may indicate a synergetic role of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis of childhood LRTI.","publish_time":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nunes, Marta C.; Kuschner, Zachary; Rabede, Zelda; Madimabe, Richard; Van Niekerk, Nadia; Moloi, Jackie; Kuwanda, Locadiah; Rossen, John W.; Klugman, Keith P.; Adrian, Peter V.; Madhi, Shabir A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5243628f77d40d5861c26212a3cc3102d9b2449.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3911925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498274/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV-infected","HIV-uninfected children","respiratory viruses","majority of HIV","tested viruses","specific viruses","human rhinovirus","aetiology of LRTI","LRTI-episodes","human metapneumovirus","human coronaviruses","respiratory syncytial virus","hBoV","pathogenesis of childhood LRTI","CoV-OC43","lower respiratory tract infections","high frequency of viral co-infections","clinical characteristics of human bocavirus","Polyomavirus-KI","WUPyV","synergetic role of viral co-infections","pathogenesis of pneumonia","polyomavirus-WU","complexities","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","attributing causality","archived nasopharyngeal aspirates","parainfluenza","KIPyV","hRV","prevalence","HKU1","association","years age","molecular diagnostics","BACKGROUND","Advances","adenovirus","METHODS","RESULTS","NL63","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We surveyed Ebola knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP) among the institute\u0027s healthcare workers. Study design This was a cross-sectional survey. Methods The study consisted of a self-administered paper-based anonymous questionnaire that included 24 closed-item questions and two scales of personal concern. Results Respondents were generally well informed; compared to nurses, doctors recorded a 1.9-fold higher rate of correct responses regarding Ebola transmission (P \u003C 0.001), but both nurses and doctors correctly identified Ebola\u0027s aetiological agent. Nurses perceived higher personal (P = 0.008) and family (P \u003C 0.001) risk than doctors. Respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about Ebola (P = 0.019) and its prevention options (P = 0.033). Males were 6.7-fold more likely to volunteer than females (P = 0.001) and so were graduates of higher rather than lower education (1.5-fold more likely, P = 0.017) and doctors than nurses (1.7-fold more likely, P = 0.018). The institute ranked first among sources of information on Ebola; respondents who had received Ebola training in the institute 2 years previously were 1.2\u20131.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes. Conclusions We have characterised KAP on Ebola disease among Romanian healthcare workers from a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest.

Vaccines are cost-effective tools to prevent disease, and emergency vaccines may be the only means to prevent a true disaster for global society in the event of a new pandemic with potential to cause morbidity and mortality comparable to the Spanish flu, the polio epidemics in the 1950s, or the SARS outbreak in 2003 if its spread had not been contained in time. Given the early recognition of a new threat, and given the advances of biotechnology, vaccinology and information systems, it is not an unrealistic goal to have promising prototype vaccine candidates available in a short time span following the identification of a new infectious agent; this is based on the assumption that the emerging infection is followed by natural immunity. However, major bottlenecks for the deployment of emergency vaccine are lack of established systems for fast-track regulatory approval of such candidates and limited international vaccine production capacity. In the present discussion paper, we propose mechanisms to facilitate development of emergency vaccines in Europe by focusing on public\u2013private scientific partnerships, fast-track approval of emergency vaccine by regulatory agencies and proposing incentives for emergency vaccine production in private vaccine companies.","publish_time":"2009-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00F8borg, Christian; M\u00F8lbak, K\u00E5re; Doherty, T.

Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric co-morbidities, and has been causally linked for the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with a responsibility to limit spread of the contagion, and their responsibility to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for. METHODS: To address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia. Endorsement from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document, with a 1-week suspense period. RESULTS: In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain practitioners and institutions to balance the often-conflicting goals of risk mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of resources, and access to pain management services. Specific issues discussed include general and interventional-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has strained health care systems, creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, and regulatory officials. Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, the welfare of health care providers.

In vivo PP1 does not exist as a free catalytic subunit but is always associated with at least one regulatory PP1-interacting protein (PIP) to generate a large set of distinct holoenzymes. Each PP1 complex controls the dephosphorylation of only a small subset of PP1 substrates. We screened the literature for genetically engineered mouse models and identified models for all PP1 isoforms and 104 PIPs. PP1 itself and at least 49 PIPs were connected to human disease-associated phenotypes. Additionally, phenotypes related to 17 PIPs were clearly linked to altered PP1 function, while such information was lacking for 32 other PIPs. We propose structural reverse genetics, which combines structural characterization of proteins with mouse genetics, to identify new PP1-related therapeutic targets.

The importance of protein ubiquitination to host immunity has been underscored by the discovery of viruses that encode proteases with deubiquitinating activity, many of which have been demonstrated to actively corrupt cellular ubiquitin-dependent processes to suppress innate antiviral responses and promote viral replication.

Natural ventilation can deliver much higher ventilation rate than mechanical ventilation in an energy-efficient manner. This paper reports a field measurement of naturally ventilated hospital wards in Hong Kong and presents a possibility of using natural ventilation for infection control in hospital wards. Our measurements showed that natural ventilation could achieve high ventilation rates especially when both the windows and the doors were open in a ward. The highest ventilation rate recorded in our study was 69.0 ACH. The airflow pattern and the airflow direction were found to be unstable in some measurements with large openings. Mechanical fans were installed in a ward window to create a negative pressure difference. Measurements showed that the negative pressure difference was negligible with large openings but the overall airflow was controlled in the expected direction. When all the openings were closed and the exhaust fans were turned on, a reasonable negative pressure was created although the air temperature was uncontrolled. The high ventilation rate provided by natural ventilation can reduce cross-infection of airborne diseases, and thus it is recommended for consideration of use in appropriate hospital wards for infection control. Our results also demonstrated a possibility of converting an existing ward using natural ventilation to a temporary isolation room through installing mechanical exhaust fans.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Hua; Li, Yuguo; Seto, W.

We describe three cases of disseminated mycobacteriosis in cats, caused by Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium branderi/shimoidei and M. avium, with no identified underlying immunosuppression. In all cases, extracellular mycobacteria were seen in the pulmonary epithelium, intestinal lumen and glomerular tufts, which could affect the shedding of the organism. The present study highlights the importance of mycobacteriosis as a differential even in immunocompetent animals.

However, the majority of infections are subclinical and not associated with evident birth defects. Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns. Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. To induce subclinical infection, we inoculated selected porcine fetuses at the mid-stage of development. Inoculation resulted in trans-fetal virus spread and persistent infection in the placenta and fetal membranes for two months. Offspring did not show congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., microcephaly, brain calcifications, congenital clubfoot, arthrogryposis, seizures) or other visible birth defects. However, a month after birth, a portion of offspring exhibited excessive interferon alpha (IFN-\u03B1) levels in blood plasma in a regular environment. Most affected offspring also showed dramatic IFN-\u03B1 shutdown during social stress providing the first evidence for the cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure and postnatal environmental insult. Other eleven cytokines tested before and after stress were not altered suggesting the specific IFN-\u03B1 pathology. While brains from offspring did not have histopathology, lesions, and ZIKV, the whole genome expression analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed profound sex-specific transcriptional changes that most probably was the result of subclinical in utero infection. RNA-seq analysis in the placenta persistently infected with ZIKV provided independent support for the sex-specific pattern of in utero-acquired transcriptional responses. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that two hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection, altered type I IFN response and molecular brain pathology can persist after birth in offspring in the absence of congenital Zika syndrome.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trus, Ivan; Udenze, Daniel; Cox, Brian; Berube, Nathalie; Nordquist, Rebecca E.; van der Staay, Franz Josef; Huang, Yanyun; Kobinger, Gary; Safronetz, David; Gerdts, Volker; Karniychuk, Uladzimir","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/025509677d6507aaf63c46fc8efbe60b6d63a820.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6855438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic offspring","portion of offspring","affected offspring","subclinical infection","hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection","utero infection","specific IFN-\u03B1 pathology","persistent infection","severe fetal pathology","IFN response","fetal membranes","Zika virus","trans-fetal virus","visible birth defects","evident birth defects","dramatic IFN-\u03B1 shutdown","absence of congenital Zika syndrome","molecular brain pathology","sex-specific pattern","congenital clubfoot","placenta","result of subclinical","cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure","profound sex-specific transcriptional changes","brain calcifications","altered type","strong evidence","social stress","transcriptional responses","genome expression analysis","RNA-seq analysis","prefrontal cortex","microcephaly","excessive interferon alpha","detrimental life-long health outcomes","arthrogryposis","selected porcine fetuses","levels","seizures","human pregnancy","blood plasma","postnatal environmental insult","sequelae","independent support","debilitating impairments","high concerns","mid-stage of development","histopathology","regular environment","results","animal models","valuable information","months","Inoculation","lesions","majority of infections","brains","cytokines"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (\u003C1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u226550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

In this report, we study the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced apoptosis by investigating the unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that NDV infection activated all three branches of the UPR signaling (PERK-eIF2\u03B1, ATF6, and IRE1\u03B1) and triggered apoptosis, in avian cells (DF-1 and CEF) and in various human cancer cell types (HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2). Interestingly, the suppression of either apoptosis or UPR led to impaired NDV proliferation. Meanwhile, the inhibition of UPR by 4-PBA protected cells from NDV-induced apoptosis. Further study revealed that activation of PERK-eIF2\u03B1 induced the expression of transcription factor CHOP, which subsequently promoted apoptosis by downregulating BCL-2/MCL-1, promoting JNK signaling and suppressing AKT signaling. In parallel, IRE1\u03B1 mediated the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and resulted in the translation and nuclear translocation of XBP1s, thereby promoting the transcription of ER chaperones and components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Furthermore, IRE1\u03B1 promoted apoptosis and cytokines secretion via the activation of JNK signaling. Knock down and overexpression studies showed that CHOP, IRE1\u03B1, XBP1, and JNK supported efficient virus proliferation. Our study demonstrates that the induction of eIF2\u03B1-CHOP-BCL-2/JNK and IRE1\u03B1-XBP1/JNK signaling cascades promote apoptosis and cytokines secretion, and these signaling cascades support NDV proliferation.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yanrong; Jiang, Weiyu; Niu, Qiaona; Sun, Yingjie; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Liao, Ying; Ding, Chan","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85bab4f8869727adbe47f5ddc6e18af508dc57a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6877643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6877643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","UPR","CEF","NDV","AKT","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV-induced apoptosis","triggered apoptosis","IRE1\u03B1-XBP1","activation of JNK","NDV infection","impaired NDV proliferation","cytokines secretion","study","PERK-eIF2\u03B1","CHOP-BCL","inhibition of UPR","cascades","avian cells","tumor cells","induction of eIF2\u03B1","activation of PERK","efficient virus proliferation","expression of transcription factor CHOP","PBA protected cells","transcription of ER chaperones","splicing of XBP1 mRNA","Newcastle disease virus","components of ER","downregulating BCL","severe infectious disease","HeLa","Cal27","various human cancer cell types","HN13","H1299","A549","translation","CEF","poultry","associated degradation","unfolded protein response","Huh7","DF","ATF6","branches","mechanisms","nuclear translocation of XBP1s","ERAD","MCL","overexpression studies","HepG2","suppression","report","AKT"],"language":"en"},

We estimated the potential impact of trends in diabetes prevalence upon mortality and the future burden of dementia and disability in England and Wales. METHODS: We used a probabilistic multi-state, open cohort Markov model to integrate observed trends in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia to forecast the occurrence of disability and dementia up to the year 2060. Model input data were taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Office for National Statistics vital data and published effect estimates for health-state transition probabilities. The baseline scenario corresponded to recent trends in obesity: a 26% increase in the number of people with diabetes by 2060. This scenario was evaluated against three alternative projected trends in diabetes: increases of 49%, 20% and 7%. RESULTS: Our results suggest that changes in the trend in diabetes prevalence will lead to changes in mortality and incidence of dementia and disability, which will become visible after 10\u201315 years. If the relative prevalence of diabetes increases 49% by 2060, expected additional deaths would be approximately 255,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 236,000\u2013272,200), with 85,900 (71,500\u2013101,600) cumulative additional cases of dementia and 104,900 (85,900\u2013125,400) additional cases of disability. With a smaller relative increase in diabetes prevalence (7% increase by 2060), we estimated 222,200 (205,700\u2013237,300) fewer deaths, and 77,000 (64,300\u201390,800) and 93,300 (76,700\u2013111,400) fewer additional cases of dementia and disability, respectively, than the baseline case of a 26% increase in diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Reducing the burden of diabetes could result in substantial reductions in the incidence of dementia and disability over the medium to long term.

Since then, sporadic ZIKV infections of humans have been reported in Africa and Asia. For a long time, this virus was mostly unnoticed due to its mild symptoms and low fatality rates. However, during the 2015\u20132016 epidemic in Central and South America, when millions of people were infected, it was discovered that ZIKV causes microcephaly in the babies of mothers infected during pregnancy. An examination of the M and C proteins of the ZIKV shell using the disorder predictor PONDR VLXT revealed that the M protein contains relatively high disorder levels comparable only to those of the yellow fever virus (YFV). On the other hand, the disorder levels in the C protein are relatively low, which can account for the low case fatality rate (CFR) of this virus in contrast to the more virulent YFV, which is characterized by high disorder in its C protein. A larger variation was found in the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the C protein of various ZIKV strains. Strains of African lineage are characterized by higher PIDs. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, laboratories have also previously shown that strains of African origin have a greater potential to inflict higher fetal morbidity than do strains of Asian lineage, with dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) having the least potential. Strong correlations were found between the potential to inflict fetal morbidity and shell disorder in ZIKV (r(2) = 0.9) and DENV-2 (DENV-2 \u002B ZIKV, r(2) = 0.8). A strong correlation between CFR and PID was also observed when ZIKV was included in an analysis of sets of shell proteins from a variety of flaviviruses (r(2) = 0.8). These observations have potential implications for antiviral vaccine development and for the design of cancer therapeutics in terms of developing therapeutic viruses that penetrate hard-to-reach organs.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

The common route of A. phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite, the main vector in Europe being Ixodes ricinus. Despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen A. phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from Europe, up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) remain rare compared to the worldwide status. It is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in Europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers, hunters, veterinarians, and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas. Although the overall genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in Europe is higher than in the USA, the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents. However, the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date. Most of the European HGA cases presented as a mild infection, common clinical signs being pyrexia, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the USA was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patient\u2019s history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, in Europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection, laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse. The drug of choice for HGA is doxycycline and because of potential for serious complication the treatment should be instituted on clinical suspicion alone.","publish_time":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matei, Ioana A.; Estrada-Pe\u00F1a, Agust\u00EDn; Cutler, Sally J.; Vayssier-Taussat, Muriel; Varela-Castro, Luc\u00EDa; Potkonjak, Aleksandar; Zeller, Herve; Mihalca, Andrei D.","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ce1a59d7c804025b82f5c839d5f55d8b4351412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6925858.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6925858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozgx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anaplasma"],"organizations":["HGA","USA"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["mild infection","clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis","common clinical signs","European HGA cases","phagocytophilum transmission","Anaplasma phagocytophilum","human infections","clinical suspicion","diagnosis of HGA","tick-bite history","tick bite","treatment","majority of cases","date","USA","increased occupational risk of infection","specialized laboratory tests","various hosts","patient\u2019s history","strains responsible","genetic variability","common route of","overall genetic diversity of","equine","pyrexia","forestry workers","doxycycline","ticks","headache","main vector","agent of tick-borne fever","difference of pathogenicity","domestic animals","assessment","veterinarians","hunters","infectivity","potential","farmers","epidemiological dynamics","serious complication","myalgia","Ixodes ricinus","arthralgia","order","antibiotic overuse","study","ubiquitous presence","drug of choice","endemic areas","disease","Epidemiologic studies","worldwide status","continents"],"language":"en"},

Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdulkareem, Shaheen A.; Augustijn, Ellen-Wien; Filatova, Tatiana; Musial, Katarzyna; Mustafa, Yaseen T.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6944362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzExNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social learning","individual learning","collective learning","group learning","role of intelligent learning","implications of intelligent learning","data-driven machine learning","context-dependent learning","based diffusion models","Mixing agent-based modeling","agent-based models of socio","social interactions","diffusion modeling","leader-based groups","individual intelligent judgement","diffusion process","diffusion of coping strategies","collective process","social norms prevalent","myriad of risks","individuals","selection of coping strategies","environmental methods","environmental systems","risk appraisal","protective decisions","research gap","effectiveness of protective measures","awareness of risk spreads","research agenda of various domains","disease","gradient","majority votes","natural hazards","core mechanisms","technological disruptions","modeled society","simulation experiments","differences","deep understanding","popularity","Modern societies","processes","choice","little attention","Methodological approaches"],"language":"en"},

Protection in humans is strongly correlated with the production of T cells targeting a heterogeneous population of pre-erythrocyte antigen proteoforms, including liver stage antigens. Currently, few T cell epitopes derived from Plasmodium falciparum, the major aetiologic agent of malaria in humans are known. METHODS: In this study both in vitro and in vivo malaria liver stage models were used to sequence host and pathogen proteoforms. Proteoforms from these diverse models were subjected to mild acid elution (of soluble forms), multi-dimensional fractionation, tandem mass spectrometry, and top-down bioinformatics analysis to identify proteoforms in their intact state. RESULTS: These results identify a group of host and malaria liver stage proteoforms that meet a 5% false discovery rate threshold. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides proof-of-concept for the validity of this mass spectrometry/bioinformatic approach for future studies seeking to reveal malaria liver stage antigens towards vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winer, Benjamin; Edgel, Kimberly A.; Zou, Xiaoyan; Sellau, Julie; Hadiwidjojo, Sri; Garver, Lindsey S.; McDonough, Christin E.; Kelleher, Neil L.; Thomas, Paul M.; Villasante, Eileen; Ploss, Alexander; Gerbasi, Vincent R.","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/169e7736aebb4af54ada81d153fb519c0ea07df2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6947969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["malaria liver stage proteoforms","malaria liver stage models","malaria liver stage antigens","humans","pathogen proteoforms","attenuated malaria sporozoites","experimental malaria challenge","major aetiologic agent of malaria","RESULTS","heterogeneous population of pre-erythrocyte antigen proteoforms","tandem mass spectrometry","group of host","diverse models","production of T cells","T cell epitopes","soluble forms","Plasmodium falciparum","multi-dimensional fractionation","future studies","mild acid elution","bioinformatic approach","Immunization","vaccine development","mosquito bite","concept","validity","BACKGROUND","false discovery rate threshold","work","proof","bioinformatics analysis","study","intact state","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Protection"],"language":"en"},

However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016\u2013March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22\u201333)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16\u201328), p \u003C 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06\u20133.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06\u20130.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04\u20135.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05\u20131.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iriyama, Hiroki; Abe, Toshikazu; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Fujishima, Seitaro; Ogura, Hiroshi; Shiraishi, Atsushi; Saitoh, Daizoh; Mayumi, Toshihiko; Naito, Toshio; Komori, Akira; Hifumi, Toru; Shiino, Yasukazu; Nakada, Taka-aki; Tarui, Takehiko; Otomo, Yasuhiro; Okamoto, Kohji; Umemura, Yutaka; Kotani, Joji; Sakamoto, Yuichiro; Sasaki, Junichi; Shiraishi, Shin-ichiro; Takuma, Kiyotsugu; Tsuruta, Ryosuke; Hagiwara, Akiyoshi; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Masuno, Tomohiko; Takeyama, Naoshi; Yamashita, Norio; Ikeda, Hiroto; Ueyama, Masashi; Fujimi, Satoshi; Gando, Satoshi","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52339ad5c27791f45c98f8fa59824ecd72a8ea1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ICU"],"locations":["Japan","Berlin"],"keyphrases":["risk modifiers of ARDS","non-pulmonary infection","non-pulmonary sepsis","infection site","Adult patients","abdominal infection","risk factors","higher APACHE","soft tissue infection","risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe sepsis","Emergency Care","emergency department","smoking status","lower score","ICU admission source","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","acute physiology","septic shock","current smoking","Multivariate logistic regression modeling","statin use","steroid use","chronic health evaluation","intensive care units","following explanatory variables","congestive heart failure","diabetes mellitus","body mass index","Focused Outcomes Research","Trauma","age","sex","FORECAST","hospital wards","exclusion criteria","causes","Predisposing conditions","secondary analysis","ICUs","cohort study","inclusion","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","scores","odds ratios","Japan","alternatives","data","primary outcome","METHODS","RESULTS","Berlin definition","day of screening","confidence intervals"],"language":"en"},

Alternatively, direct NAATs\u2014techniques that minimize or even bypass sample preparation\u2014present promising strategies for developing POC diagnostic tools for analyzing real-world samples. In this review, we discuss the current status of direct NAATs. Specifically, we surveyed potential testing systems published from 1989 to 2017, and analyzed their performances in terms of robustness, sensitivity, clinical relevance, and suitability for POC diagnostics. We introduce bubble plots to facilitate our analysis, as bubble plots enable effective visualization of the performances of these direct NAATs.

The cooperative biological research (CBR) program of the US DoD\u2019s Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided financing, mentorship, infrastructure, and biologic research support to Kazakhstani scientists and research institutes since 2005. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective for the CBR involvement in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges to allow lessons learned to be applied to future CBR endeavors. A project compendium from open source data and interviews with partner country Kazakhstani participants, project collaborators, and stakeholders was developed utilizing studies from 2004 to the present. An earlier project map was used as a basis to determine project linkages and continuations during the evolution of the CBR program. It was determined that consistent and effective networking increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities. Overall, the CBR program has increased scientific capabilities in Kazakhstan while reducing their risk of biological threats. However, there is still need for increased scientific transparency and an overall strategy to develop a capability-based model to better enhance and sustain future research. Finally, we offer a living perspective that can be applied to further link related studies especially those related to One Health and zoonoses and the assessment of similar capability-building programs.","publish_time":"2019-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeh, Kenneth B.; Parekh, Falgunee K.; Musralina, Lyazzat; Sansyzbai, Ablay; Tabynov, Kairat; Shapieva, Zhanna; Richards, Allen L.; Hay, John","journal":"Trop Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/604491e627b3cb8661ee7f8747623eb4c61f0315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6958332.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBR"],"locations":["United States","Kazakhstan"],"keyphrases":["CBR program","biological weapons","project collaborators","project compendium","project chronology","cooperative biological research","project linkages","CBR involvement","future research","US DoD\u2019s Biological Threat Reduction Program","future CBR endeavors","research institutes","earlier project map","threat reduction programs","biologic research support","risk of biological threats","US Department of Defense","increased scientific transparency","link related studies","Kazakhstani scientists","proliferation of weapons","scientific capabilities","overall strategy","historical perspective","living perspective","assessment of similar capability","capability-based model","partner country Kazakhstani participants","interviews","open source data","mentorship","financing","infectious disease outbreaks","chances","surveillance systems","infrastructure","repositories","successes","basis","continuations","evolution","secure material","zoonoses","challenges","stakeholders","national security","effective networking","theft","paper","mass destruction","Health","lessons","competitive funding opportunities","United States","objective"],"language":"en"},

AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged \u003E 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1\u20133 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4\u20136 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7\u20138 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9\u201310 (7%; 95%CI: \u22124 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001).

For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously. CONCLUSIONS: Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations, current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwong, Jeffrey C; Chung, Hannah; Jung, James KH; Buchan, Sarah A; Campigotto, Aaron; Campitelli, Michael A; Crowcroft, Natasha S; Gubbay, Jonathan B; Karnauchow, Timothy; Katz, Kevin; McGeer, Allison J; McNally, J Dayre; Richardson, David C; Richardson, Susan E; Rosella, Laura C; Schwartz, Kevin L; Simor, Andrew; Smieja, Marek; Zahariadis, George","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20317b47f1178792d735b4202fc343721d1ff4a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6961264.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza seasons","previous seasons","higher current season VE","Annual influenza vaccination","previous vaccination history","impact of repeated vaccination","misclassification of current season vaccination status","increasing numbers of previous vaccinations","Adjusted VE","increasing numbers of vaccinations","laboratory","number of vaccinations","Patients","older adults","community-dwelling adults","residual protection","testing episodes","trend test p","observational test-negative study","evidence","years","vaccine effectiveness","health administrative data","respiratory viruses","Ontario","Canada","multivariable logistic regression","INTRODUCTION","AIM","RESULTS","METHODS","estimates","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is involved in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction pathways. This study explored the potential role of FAK in AECs during lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation. High-volume mechanical ventilation (HMV) was used to create a mouse lung injury model, which was validated by analysis of lung weight, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological investigation. The expression of FAK and Akt in AECs were evaluated. In addition, recombinant FAK was administered to mice via the tail vein, and then the extent of lung injury was assessed. Mouse AECs were cultured in vitro, and FAK expression in cells under stretch was investigated. The effects of FAK on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were investigated. The results showed that HMV decreased FAK expression in AECs of mice, while FAK supplementation attenuated lung injury, reduced protein levels/cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreased histological lung injury and oedema. The protective effect of FAK promoted AEC proliferation and migration and prevented cells from undergoing apoptosis, which restored the integrity of the alveoli through Akt pathway. Therefore, the decrease in FAK expression by HMV is essential for injury to epithelial cells and the disruption of alveolar integrity. FAK supplementation can reduce AEC injury associated with HMV.","publish_time":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Mingxing; Liu, Na; Yao, Xiaoguang; Xu, Tieling; Wang, Zhiyong","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47063184fc5e63a21ee22a45733a4d15918bfb93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6962166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FAK","AEC","HMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of FAK","FAK expression","recombinant FAK","effects of FAK","FAK supplementation attenuated lung injury","histological lung injury","extent of lung injury","AEC injury","mouse lung injury model","potential role of FAK","protective effect of FAK","HMV","AECs of mice","Mouse AECs","analysis of lung weight","alveolar epithelial cells","cell proliferation","High-volume mechanical ventilation","cell growth","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","AEC proliferation","migration","apoptosis","disruption of alveolar integrity","cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase","histological investigation","Akt pathway","reduced protein levels","Focal adhesion kinase","intracellular signal transduction pathways","tail vein","alveoli","study","oedema","results","decrease","stretch","pathogenesis","addition"],"language":"en"},

These candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 CHIKV reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects, such as weight loss. Vaccination with either ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik \u0394Cap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection, indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested.

In South Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) account for a quarter of all new HIV infections. Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) is a strategy introduced by the United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by 25% in the programme\u2019s first year, and by 40% in the second year. This study will assess the change in HIV incidence and reduction in risk associated behaviours that can be attributed to the DREAMS initiative in South Africa, using a population-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data will be collected from a household-based representative sample of AGYW (between the ages 12\u201324 years) in four high prevalence districts (more than 10% of the population have HIV in these districts) in South Africa in which DREAMS has been implemented. A stratified cluster-based sampling approach will be used to select eligible participants for a cross-sectional survey with 18,500, to be conducted over 2017/2018. A questionnaire will be administered containing questions on sexual risk behaviour, selected academic and developmental milestones, prevalence of gender based violence, whilst examining exposure to DREAMS programmes. Biological samples, including two micro-containers of blood and self-collected vulvovaginal swab samples, are collected in each survey to test for HIV infection, HIV incidence, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. This study will measure trends in population level HIV incidence using the Limiting antigen (LAg) Avidity Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) and monitor changes in HIV incidence. DISCUSSION: Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic by 2030 requires the continual monitoring and evaluation of prevention programmes, with the aim of optimising efforts and ensuring the achievement of epidemic control. This study will determine the impact DREAMS interventions have had on HIV incidence among AGYW in a \u2018real world, non-trial setting\u2019.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"George, Gavin; Cawood, Cherie; Puren, Adrian; Khanyile, David; Gerritsen, Annette; Govender, Kaymarlin; Beckett, Sean; Glenshaw, Mary; Diallo, Karidia; Ayalew, Kassahun; Gibbs, Andrew; Reddy, Tarylee; Madurai, Lorna; Kufa-Chakezha, Tendesayi; Kharsany, Ayesha B.

Compared with conventional procedures, the uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UniVATS) rises in popularity in thoracic surgery because of less pain and faster recovery. This retrospective study aimed to apply UniVATS to treat severe thoracic scoliosis. Between October 2013 and March 2018, eight scoliotic patients with extremely large Cobb angle and profoundly limited flexibility underwent UniVATS for anterior release, followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.8 \u00B1 2.4 years and the mean follow-up was 2.2 \u00B1 1.3 years. The average levels of anterior thoracic discectomy and posterior fusion were 3.6 \u00B1 0.7 and 11.5 \u00B1 1.2, respectively. The mean coronal and sagittal correction rates were 70 \u00B1 19% and 71 \u00B1 23%, respectively.

That travel to an infected area was the most common epidemiological link with SARS infections supports Rodier\u2019s position. However, as suggested in the Naylor report, issuing a travel advisory does not keep infected individuals from leaving Toronto and such individuals account for 5 of 6 cases where SARS was spread from Canada. That alone would discount Rodier\u2019s argument and the WHO decision on purely logistical grounds. But there is an ethical question as well. Was the travel advisory implemented fairly? This question is best judged using Nancy E. Kass\u2019s framework for public health. From that framework, two points are placed in immediate relief. First, the Toronto authorities were not given an opportunity to state their case to WHO before the travel advisory was implemented. Second, the framework requires that burdens be distributed fairly and the travel advisory did not do that, or even attempt to do so.","publish_time":"2007-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paquin, Leo J.","journal":"Canadian Journal of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf606211bd21e032f73f513a058907333e72c4fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975986/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.M.

This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of low-dose (5\u201310 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the management of hypoxemia after AADA surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3\u201347.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8\u2013110.3), p \u003C 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8\u2013155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0\u2013258.0), p \u003C 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in mortality, complications, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that low-dose iNO improved oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia after AADA surgery and shortened the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidities were observed with iNO treatment. These findings warrant a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the exact efficiency of iNO for hypoxemia after AADA.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hang; Liu, Yaoyang; Meng, Xiangdong; Yang, Dicheng; Shi, Sheng; Liu, Jian; Yuan, Zhongxiang; Gu, Tongtong; Han, Lin; Lu, Fanglin; Xu, Zhiyun; Liu, Yang; Yu, Min","journal":"J Cardiothorac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b2aa0ba21e7dc12712d0766ca7815a67fbe245a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6977331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AADA","PSM","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Postoperative hypoxemia","iNO treatment","AADA surgery","management of hypoxemia","exact efficiency of iNO","low-dose iNO improved oxygenation","postoperative mortality","PSM control","Medical records of patients","efficacy of low","control groups","ICU","retrospective observational study","negative outcomes","durations of mechanical ventilation","durations of ventilator support","acute type","aortic dissection","randomized multicenter controlled trial","complications","findings","group differences","common complication","ppm","BACKGROUND","morbidities","propensity score","nitric oxide","METHODS","effects","length of hospital","Clinical characteristics","analysis","surgical repair","initiation","institutions","vs","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Redox imbalance and excessive release of inflammatory mediators have been intricately linked in obesity-associated phenotypes. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of redox signaling pathways and molecular targets exacerbating oxidative stress is crucial in improving health outcomes. The activation of Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling, and its downstream pathways, by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recently implicated in obesity and subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which causes further production of ROS creating an oxidant amplification loop. Apart from that, numerous studies have also characterized antioxidant properties of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is suppressed in an obese state. The induction of HO-1 restores cellular redox processes, which contributes to inhibition of the toxic milieu. The novelty of these independent mechanisms presents a unique opportunity to unravel their potential as molecular targets for redox regulation in obesity and NASH. The attenuation of oxidative stress, by understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and associated mediators, with a targeted treatment modality may provide for improved therapeutic options to combat clinical disorders.","publish_time":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratt, Rebecca; Lakhani, Hari Vishal; Zehra, Mishghan; Desauguste, Rutmann; Pillai, Sneha S.; Sodhi, Komal","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c7d045c73a10e8b81cc58d86d7cf5d144f83b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6982200.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6982200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROS","NASH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of redox","obesity-associated phenotypes","molecular targets","redox regulation","Redox imbalance","associated mediators","underlying molecular mechanisms","cellular redox processes","NASH","independent mechanisms","attenuation of oxidative stress","downstream pathways","production of ROS","induction of HO","excessive release of inflammatory mediators","impaired mitochondrial biogenesis","improved therapeutic options","adipocyte dysfunction","potential","targeted treatment modality","lipid accumulation","reactive oxygen species","antioxidant properties of heme oxygenase","altered metabolic profile","unique opportunity","clinical disorders","Src","inhibition","subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis","oxidant amplification loop","health outcomes","multifaceted pathophysiological condition","ATPase","numerous studies","activation of Na","toxic milieu","novelty","obese state"],"language":"en"},

Halophilic enzymes of potential interest to biotechnology have opened up the application of this organism in biocatalysis, bioremediation, nanobiotechnology, bioplastics and the biofuel industry. Functionally active halophilic proteins can be easily expressed in a halophilic environment, and an extensive genetic toolkit with options for regulated protein overexpression has allowed the purification of biotechnologically important enzymes from different halophiles in H. volcanii. However, corrosion mediated damage caused to stainless-steel bioreactors by high salt concentrations and a tendency to form biofilms when cultured in high volume are some of the challenges of applying H. volcanii in biotechnology. The ability to employ expressed active proteins in immobilized cells within a porous biocompatible matrix offers new avenues for exploiting H. volcanii in biotechnology. This review critically evaluates the various application potentials, challenges and toolkits available for using this extreme halophilic organism in biotechnology.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haque, R.

Diagnosis remains a cornerstone to the Peste des petits ruminants Global Control and Eradication Strategy, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The present review presents the peste des petits ruminants diagnostic landscape, including the practicality of commercially available diagnostic tools, prototype tests and opportunities for new technologies. The most common peste des petits ruminants diagnostic tools include; agar gel immunodiffusion, counter-immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction either gel-based or real-time, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays, immunochromatographic lateral flow devices, luciferase immunoprecipitation system and pseudotype-based assays. These tests vary in their technical demands, but all require a laboratory with exception of immunochromatographic lateral flow and possibly reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays. Thus, we are proposing an efficient integration of diagnostic tests for rapid and correct identification of peste des petits ruminants in endemic zones and to rapidly confirm outbreaks. Deployment of pen-side tests will improve diagnostic capacity in extremely remote settings and susceptible wildlife ecosystems, where transportation of clinical samples in the optimum cold chain is unreliable.","publish_time":"2020-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kinimi, Edson; Odongo, Steven; Muyldermans, Serge; Kock, Richard; Misinzo, Gerald","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34141b4636dd71b7b61525ac09547d8e7ab66a76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6988203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Control and Eradication Strategy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["petits ruminants diagnostic tools","reverse transcription loop","petits ruminants diagnostic landscape","reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays","petits ruminants virus","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","isothermal amplification","petits ruminants Global Control","diagnostic capacity","common peste","efficient integration of diagnostic tests","available diagnostic tools","prototype tests","correct identification of peste","pseudotype-based assays","immunochromatographic lateral flow devices","exception of immunochromatographic lateral flow","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","World Organisation","Agriculture Organisation","agar gel immunodiffusion","optimum cold chain","luciferase immunoprecipitation system","counter-immunoelectrophoresis","susceptible wildlife ecosystems","transportation of clinical samples","Eradication Strategy","initiative","Animal Health","remote settings","contagious disease","opportunities","enormous economic losses","practicality","domestic animals","Food","laboratory","endemic zones","new technologies","cornerstone","present review","conservation of wild herbivores","technical demands","Deployment of pen","outbreaks","Diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

The level of reachability thus inherently limits the possible extent of any spreading process on the temporal network.

However, research examining this issue among older adults in residential care homes (RCHs) is scant. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of mobile device use on the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). RESULTS: A total of 235 senior residents (aged 82.58 \u00B1 5.54) in four RCHs were surveyed. Users of mobile devices had a significantly higher total MoCA score (25.02 \u00B1 4.14) and a significantly lower GDS-15 score (3.28 \u00B1 2.74) than non-users (MoCA: 19.34 \u00B1 5.21, GDS-15: 4.69 \u00B1 2.90). Multivariate linear regression indicate that mobile device use is significantly associated with total MoCA score, six of the seven sub-scores (visuospatial abilities and execution functions, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation)(P \u003C 0.05).

The primary outcome was selected to be the change in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include other investigator-assessed efficacy measures of disease severity, participant-reported measures of efficacy and safety measures. This manuscript describes in detail the outcomes, sample size, general analysis principles, the pre-specified statistical analysis plan for each of the outcomes, the handling of missing outcome data and the planned sensitivity and supplementary analyses for the second stage of the APRICOT trial. DISCUSSION: This statistical analysis plan was developed in compliance with international trial guidelines and is published to increase transparency of the trial analysis. The results of the trial analysis will indicate whether anakinra has a role in the treatment of PPP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISCRTN, ISCRTN13127147. Registered on 1 August 2016.

The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh mother\u2019s own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed. METHODS: Our prospective multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial will include infants born at \u003C 30 weeks\u2019 gestation and admitted to one of 29 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeks\u2019 corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC \u2265 stage 2 at 32 weeks\u2019 corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC \u2265 stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors. DISCUSSION: Our double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aims to examine whether fresh human milk can improve infant outcomes. The results of this study will impact both Chinese and international medical practice and feeding policy for preterm infants. In addition, data from our study will inform changes in health policy in NICUs across China, such that mothers are encouraged to enter the NICU and express fresh milk for their infants.

Several approaches and tools, such as multi-criteria decision analysis, health technology assessments and evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks, have been proposed to guide decision-makers in selecting the criteria most relevant and appropriate for a transparent decision-making process. This study forms part of the development of the WHO-INTEGRATE EtD framework, a framework rooted in global health norms and values as reflected in key documents of the World Health Organization and the United Nations system. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of criteria used in or proposed for real-world decision-making processes, including guideline development, health technology assessment, resource allocation and others. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews through a combination of systematic literature searches and extensive reference searches. Systematic reviews reporting criteria used for real-world health decision-making by governmental or non-governmental organization on a supranational, national, or programme level were included and their quality assessed through a bespoke critical appraisal tool. The criteria reported in the reviews were extracted, de-duplicated and sorted into first-level (i.e. criteria), second-level (i.e. sub-criteria) and third-level (i.e. decision aspects) categories. First-level categories were developed a priori using a normative approach; second- and third-level categories were developed inductively. RESULTS: We included 36 systematic reviews providing criteria, of which one met all and another eleven met at least five of the items of our critical appraisal tool. The criteria were subsumed into 8 criteria, 45 sub-criteria and 200 decision aspects. The first-level of the category system comprised the following seven substantive criteria: \u201CHealth-related balance of benefits and harms\u201D; \u201CHuman and individual rights\u201D; \u201CAcceptability considerations\u201D; \u201CSocietal considerations\u201D; \u201CConsiderations of equity, equality and fairness\u201D; \u201CCost and financial considerations\u201D; and \u201CFeasibility and health system considerations\u201D. In addition, we identified an eight criterion \u201CEvidence\u201D. CONCLUSION: This overview of systematic reviews provides a comprehensive overview of criteria used or suggested for real-world health decision-making. It also discusses key challenges in the selection of the most appropriate criteria and in seeking to implement a fair decision-making process.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stratil, J.

Therefore, it is important to identify the associated factors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe our experience with a 37-year-old man diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (influenza A). He presented with acute respiratory failure type I on admission. During intubation, his blood pressure and heart rate decreased, and epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered. Although his clinical condition improved 8 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he experienced difficulty weaning. He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength. His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation type I, posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, and syringomyelia, with compression and deformation of the medulla and high cervical cord. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator at 20 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation type I and posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, which aggravate medullary compression and increase the risk of cervical nerve injury, might be a rare factor affecting prolonged weaning in critical illness.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Renyu; Meng, Yulan; Jia, Xingjuan; Ma, Xiaochun","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56304781bfeaf000226ca046c3042d98b4c9bc33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7014774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU admission","prolonged weaning","Chiari malformation","posterior dislocation","odontoid process","days","difficult weaning","Arnold","difficulty weaning","sputum production","cough reflex","medullary compression","acute respiratory failure type","associated factors","bronchoscopic sputum suction","poor spontaneous cough","high cervical cord","risk of cervical nerve injury","rare factor","intensive care unit","weak limb muscle strength","heart rate","severe viral pneumonia","year-old man","abdominal breathing","deformation","critical illness","higher rates of complications","experience","blood pressure","Magnetic resonance imaging","syringomyelia","ventilator","T-tube test","clinical condition","intubation","mortality","influenza","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","CASE PRESENTATION","norepinephrine","patient"],"language":"en"},

The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro; Pardee, Keith; Pena, Lindomar","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7151947d17c83f7764b115d4e21a982738bb12f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019470.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019470/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC","ZIKV","LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infections","lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV","based diagnostics","lab-based equipment","LAMP assays","RT-qPCR","different LAMP methods","gold standard molecular method","POC diagnostic test","low-cost molecular system","recent outbreak of Zika virus","reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction","insect vectors","approved vaccines","neurological manifestations","distribution","tool","patient samples","development of field","Americas","compelling alternative","developing countries","high specificity","sensitivity","handheld","resource-poor settings","care","lack of antivirals","expertise","greater accessibility","early detection of new outbreaks","growing body of evidence","isothermal amplification","efficiency","features","advantages","point","review","Loop","limitations","patients","arboviruses"],"language":"en"},

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. RESULTS: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuammitri, Phongsakorn; Vannamahaxay, Soulasack; Sornpet, Benjaporn; Pringproa, Kidsadagon; Patchanee, Prapas","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f287cdbc6b706443ee5c1a1e50050515d8a613c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7023829.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["CPV","Crandell Reese Feline Kidney"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target genes of miR","potential target genes","gene targets of miR","novel miRNAs","miRNA repertoire of CPV","cognate target genes","miRNA libraries","involvement of miRNA","novel therapeutic targets","diagnostic biomarkers of CPV","altered miRNA profiling","great potential","potential function","sRNA-seq","aforementioned miRNAs","known miRNAs","putative targets","examination of miRNA expression profiles","negative regulation of cytokine production","negative regulation of programed cell death","infected cells","biological process network","gene regulators","Gene Ontology","Control","terms","discovery of potential intervention candidates","cellular defense","enrichment analysis","marginal zone B cell differentiation","high-throughput small RNA-seq","key cellular factor","c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells","lymphocyte activation","IL6","canine parvovirus","technology","tissue culture systems","GATA3","LEF1","DLL1","LFNG","essential role","infection","humoral response","sequence homology algorithms","BCL6","WNT1","total","probing scheme","present study","molecular phenomena","related viruses","MicroRNAs","METHOD","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Several databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register were searched up to November 14, 2019. All randomized trials investigating the use of NMBAs in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and reporting mortality data were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, including respiratory physiological parameters, incidence of barotrauma, ICU-free days, and ventilation-free days. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials enrolling 1598 patients were finally included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that the use of NMBAs in moderate-to-severe ARDS could significantly decrease the mortality truncated to day 28 (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98, P = 0.03) and day 90 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99, P = 0.04). NMBA use could significantly decrease the incidence of barotrauma (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, P = 0.009). No significant difference was observed in ICU-free days or ventilation-free days between the NMBA and control groups. CONCLUSION: The use of NMBAs could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. However, more large-scale randomized trials are needed to further validate the effect of NMBA use in ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Wei; Sun, Qin; Peng, Fei; Xie, Jianfeng; Qiu, Haibo; Yang, Yi","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6383dad32d5b375938a5adede9d482aa5174e98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7027110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7027110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","Cochrane Central Register","NMBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of NMBAs","severe ARDS patients","ventilation-free days","effect of NMBA use","ICU-free days","incidence of barotrauma","RR","up-to-date trials","large-scale randomized trials","reporting mortality data","mechanical ventilation","meta-analysis","RESULTS","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","clinical outcomes","secondary outcomes","respiratory physiological parameters","Web of Science","effects of neuromuscular blocking agent","PubMed","databases","EMBASE","Cochrane Central Register","control groups","total","primary outcome","significant difference","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them, such as competitive replication, which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice, genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However, genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study, which were evaluated by the body weight, airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model, competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary, we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B, and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes.

One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite. METHODS: Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u02B9-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed. RESULTS: Asapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study. Subsequently, the structural features and immunological properties of its coded protein were evaluated by in silico approaches. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant AsAPN-1, which was expressed in Sf9 insect cell line, was equal to 6 unit/\u03BCl. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed that AsAPN-1 is very similar to its counterpart in An. gambiae. In silico evaluation and fundamental data which are necessary for its evaluation as a VIMT-based vaccine in the next steps were acquired in this study and those could be useful for research groups that study on malaria vaccine for countries that An. stephensi is the main malaria vector there.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dadgar Pakdel, Javad; Zakeri, Sedigheh; Raz, Abbasali; Dinparast Djadid, Navid","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8258250cfa2702747fae2f183d320e4e264bf6fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","VIMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["malaria vaccine","malaria disease","malaria transmission","main malaria vector","study","VIMT-based vaccine","Recombinant AsAPN","vector-based vaccine","different malaria regions","successful control of malaria","potent vector-based VIMT","Anopheles stephensi","biological activity","type of VIMT","Sf9 insect cell line","gene","specific features","coded protein","Anopheles gambiae","structural features","Enzymatic activity","silico evaluation","RESULTS","sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite","main reasons of disease survival","considerable inhibition activity","specific regional strategies","sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle","billions of people","preventive strategies","structural analysis","silico approaches","biological characteristics","genome walking methods","high risk areas","World Health Organization reports","diversity of vectors","3\u02B9-RACE","distinct bioinformatics software","rapid amplification of cDNA ends","parasites","sequence determination of apn","Systems","aminopeptidase N","immunological properties","Spodoptera frugiperda","research groups","countries","baculovirus expression system","fundamental data","prevention of reintroduction","recent studies","unit","behaviour","biology","elimination","hybrid condition","VIMTs","steps","\u03BCl","counterpart","BACKGROUND","broad concept","AgAPN","CONCLUSIONS","time","tools"],"language":"en"},

We thus propose that coevolution of microbes with their hosts may favour microbes that induce their host to cooperate. Using computational modelling, we show that microbe-induced cooperation can evolve and be maintained in a wide range of conditions, including when facing hosts\u0027 resistance to the microbial effect. We find that host\u2013microbe coevolution leads the population to a rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors dynamics that enables maintenance of cooperation in a polymorphic state.

Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4nske, Jana; Hammacher, Tim; Grenkowitz, Franziska; Mansfeld, Martin; Dau, Tung Huy; Maksimov, Pavlo; Friedrich, Christin; Zimmermann, Wolfgang; Kammerer, Robert","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e45e30b65fd34a5727e967dda22436bffc2b57e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7042247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7042247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene duplication","gene family members","analysis of gene conversion events","drivers of concerted evolution","entire CEA gene family","escape of CEACAM32","concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs","protein sequences","intron sequences","unique transmembrane domain exon","orthologous genes","sequence similarity of paralogous genes","mature protein","leader exon","Phylogenetic analysis","sufficient sequence differences","recent ancestor of ruminants","cooption","cattle","Bos taurus","paste","homologous recombination","multigene families","exons coding","DNA repair mechanism","testis-specific expression pattern","result","Reasons","descendant species","evolutionary distance","domains","findings"],"language":"en"},

Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(\u2212/\u2212)) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krishna, Smriti M.; Omer, Safraz Mohamed; Li, Jiaze; Morton, Susan K.; Jose, Roby J.; Golledge, Jonathan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2cd49bfcf2c38a171d98cb6688f633f52f4e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAD","HLI","Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging","LDPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stage HLI model","stage HLI procedure","novel model of HLI","new model","stage ischemia induction procedure","relevant animal model of PAD","PAD patients","treadmill test","advanced PAD","PAD research","main preclinical experimental model","stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion","evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies","Ischemia severity","sustained ischemia","Ambulatory ability","deficient mice","vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor","gastrocnemius muscle samples","open field test","lower expression of angiogenesis markers","lower limbs","LDPI","induction of acute hind limb ischemia","gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples","Molecular markers of angiogenesis","lower average distance","main treatments","exercise program","Exercise therapy","shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid","adjunctive medical therapies","established scoring scales","ameroid constrictors","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","days","subsequent excision","Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging","blood","greater improvement","animals","endovascular interventions","blockage of arteries","narrowing","male Apolipoprotein E","sedentary control group","efficacy","findings","sham controls","ApoE","Peripheral arterial disease","higher ischemic score","study"],"language":"en"},

She then suffered from sudden hypoxemia and hemodynamic collapse, on maximal ventilatory support, prompting an emergency cesarean section at bedside. This led to rapid stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and of her overall respiratory status.

Isothermal reaction amplification condition of RCA has an advantage over conventional polymerase chain reaction, because no temperature cycling devices are needed for RCA. Thus, RCA is suitable tool for point-of-care detection of target nucleic acids as well as facile detection of target genes. Combined with various detection methods, RCA could amplify and detect femtomolar scale of target nucleic acids with a specificity of one or two base discrimination.

Here, we report the recovery and characterization of infectious immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses (iVDRV) from diagnostic skin biopsies of four patients. Sequence evolution within PID hosts was studied by comparison of the complete genomic sequences of the iVDRVs with the genome of the vaccine virus RA27/3. The degree of divergence of each iVDRV correlated with the duration of persistence indicating continuous intrahost evolution. The evolution rates for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated to be 5.7 x 10(\u22123) subs/site/year and 8.9 x 10(\u22124) subs/site/year, respectively. Mutational spectra and signatures indicated a major role for APOBEC cytidine deaminases and a secondary role for ADAR adenosine deaminases in generating diversity of iVDRVs. The distributions of mutations across the genes and 3D hotspots for amino acid substitutions in the E1 glycoprotein identified regions that may be under positive selective pressure. Quasispecies diversity was higher in granulomas than in recovered infectious iVDRVs. Growth properties of iVDRVs were assessed in WI-38 fibroblast cultures. None of the iVDRV isolates showed complete reversion to wild type phenotype but the replicative and persistence characteristics of iVDRVs were different from those of the RA27/3 vaccine strain, making predictions of iVDRV transmissibility and teratogenicity difficult. However, detection of iVDRV RNA in nasopharyngeal specimen and poor neutralization of some iVDRV strains by sera from vaccinated persons suggests possible public health risks associated with iVDRV carriers. Detection of IgM antibody to RV in sera of two out of three patients may be a marker of virus persistence, potentially useful for identifying patients with iVDRV before development of lesions. Studies of the evolutionary dynamics of iVDRV during persistence will contribute to development of infection control strategies and antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perelygina, Ludmila; Chen, Min-hsin; Suppiah, Suganthi; Adebayo, Adebola; Abernathy, Emily; Dorsey, Morna; Bercovitch, Lionel; Paris, Kenneth; White, Kevin P.; Krol, Alfons; Dhossche, Julie; Torshin, Ivan Y.; Saini, Natalie; Klimczak, Leszek J.; Gordenin, Dmitry A.; Zharkikh, Andrey; Plotkin, Stanley; Sullivan, Kathleen E.; Icenogle, Joseph","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18592fbe580d07f487157c4f81de8baecd9700e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6837625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658304/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008080","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PID","ADAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iVDRV strains","iVDRV isolates","iVDRV carriers","detection of iVDRV RNA","predictions of iVDRV transmissibility","evolutionary dynamics of iVDRV","infectious iVDRVs","diversity of iVDRVs","persistence characteristics of iVDRVs","patients","duration of persistence","marker of virus persistence","vaccine virus RA27","Growth properties of iVDRVs","sera","vaccine strain","granulomas","evolution rates","Sequence evolution","site","year","continuous intrahost evolution","characterization of infectious immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses","major role","secondary role","complete reversion","nonsynonymous substitutions","PID hosts","development of lesions","Quasispecies diversity","APOBEC cytidine deaminases","ADAR adenosine deaminases","amino acid substitutions","complete genomic sequences","Detection of IgM antibody","development of infection control strategies","vaccinated persons","possible public health risks","wild type phenotype","poor neutralization","nasopharyngeal specimen","children","D hotspots","primary immune deficiencies","genes","regions","signatures","E1 glycoprotein","comparison","diagnostic skin biopsies","genome","antiviral therapies","teratogenicity difficult","Mutational spectra","association","recovery","Studies","positive selective pressure","distributions of mutations","fibroblast cultures","degree of divergence"],"language":"en"},

In order to continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and healthcare workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. Methods This is a non-randomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at one academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow utilization, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. Results The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and healthcare worker staffing. We formalized a COVID-19 transfer system to address patients in need of services at our institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 on our transplant ward and utilized technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible, We also modified our transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in the case of potential exposures. Conclusion Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services. Our experience highlights areas of attention specific to transplant programs, and may provide generalizable solutions to support continued transplantation in the COVID-19 era.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiessen, Carrie; Wisel, Steven A.; Yamaguchi, Seiji; Dietch, Zachary C.; Feng, Sandy; Freise, Chris E.","journal":"Transplant Proc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d818156aa1d66f81eed346a53e7db4165925b49d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134520324830?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134520324830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of California, San Francisco"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transplant ward","transplant fellow staffing","San Francisco abdominal transplant program","essential transplantation services","continued transplantation","University of California","Patient transfers","SARS-CoV","COVID","significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits","patient discharge education","healthcare worker staffing","lifesaving surgical practice","elective surgical practices","healthcare workers","key areas","immunocompromised patients","significant reorganization","fellow utilization","transfer system","need of services","risk of SARS","adequate backup system","standard clinical practices","experience highlights areas of attention specific","inpatient workflows","academic center","aggressive approach","descriptive study","responsibilities","hospital systems","technological approaches","programs","response","virtual telehealth","individualized plan","case of potential exposures","generalizable solutions","institution","programmatic changes","pandemic","Abstract Background","Conclusion","transplantations","Methods","order"],"language":"en"},

Along with other innate immunity, this nonspecific response would either clear the invading viruses or allow the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response at late stages of the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level. The results showed that IBV infection of cultured human and animal cells activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Meanwhile, IBV has developed a strategy to counteract the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of the p38 MAPK, in order to limit the production of an excessive amount of IL-6 and IL-8 in the infected cells. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus.","publish_time":"2011-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Ying; Wang, Xiaoxing; Huang, Mei; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eed5a0cc4fc05708047a6bd4627aac5cf5fdc59f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111953.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221100403X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221100403X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21959016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of IL","expression of IL","p38 MAPK pathway","Abstract Induction of pro-inflammatory response","IBV infection of cultured human","nonspecific response","animal cells","invading viruses","individual infected cells","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","effective antiviral response","pro-inflammatory cytokines","cellular mechanisms","late stages","early stages","expression of dual","DUSP1 feedback loop","crucial cellular process","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","regulation","adaptive immune system","host","specificity phosphatase","interleukin","negative regulator","multiple pathogenic effects","study","innate immunity","production","pathogenesis","results","order","activation","strategy","transcriptional level","objective"],"language":"en"},

Diverse genomic- and proteomic databases have been developed to facilitate research using human and rodent models. Current porcine gene databases, however, lack the robust annotation to study pig models that are relevant to human studies and for comparative evaluation with rodent models. Furthermore, they contain a significant number of errors due to their primary reliance on machine-based annotation. To address these deficiencies, a comprehensive literature-based survey was conducted to identify certain selected genes that have demonstrated function in humans, mice or pigs. RESULTS: The process identified 13,054 candidate human, bovine, mouse or rat genes/proteins used to select potential porcine homologs by searching multiple online sources of porcine gene information. The data in the Porcine Translational Research Database ((http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=6065) is supported by \u003E5800 references, and contains 65 data fields for each entry, including \u003E9700 full length (5\u2032 and 3\u2032) unambiguous pig sequences, \u003E2400 real time PCR assays and reactivity information on \u003E1700 antibodies. It also contains gene and/or protein expression data for \u003E2200 genes and identifies and corrects 8187 errors (gene duplications artifacts, mis-assemblies, mis-annotations, and incorrect species assignments) for 5337 porcine genes. CONCLUSIONS: This database is the largest manually curated database for any single veterinary species and is unique among porcine gene databases in regard to linking gene expression to gene function, identifying related gene pathways, and connecting data with other porcine gene databases. This database provides the first comprehensive description of three major Super-families or functionally related groups of proteins (Cluster of Differentiation (CD) Marker genes, Solute Carrier Superfamily, ATP binding Cassette Superfamily), and a comparative description of porcine microRNAs.

In infected cells, the genome is translated into non-structural polyprotein P1234, an inactive precursor of the viral replicase, which is activated by cleavages carried out by the non-structural protease, nsP2. We have characterized CHIKV nsP2 using both cell-free and cell-based assays. First, we show that Cys478 residue in the active site of CHIKV nsP2 is indispensable for P1234 processing. Second, the substrate requirements of CHIKV nsP2 are quite similar to those of nsP2 of related Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Third, substitution of Ser482 residue, recently reported to contribute to the protease activity of nsP2, with Ala has almost no negative effect on the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2. Fourth, Cys478 to Ala as well as Trp479 to Ala mutations in nsP2 completely abolished RNA replication in CHIKV and SFV trans-replication systems. In contrast, trans-replicases with Ser482 to Ala mutation were similar to wild type counterparts. Fifth, Cys478 to Ala as well as Trp479 to Ala mutations in nsP2 abolished the rescue of infectious virus from CHIKV RNA transcripts while Ser482 to Ala mutation had no effect.

Overall, 2263 plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked.

These asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of disease but go largely undetected and can therefore undermine efforts to control transmission. Understanding the natural history of carriage and its relationship to disease is important for the design of effective interventions to control transmission. Mathematical models of infectious diseases are frequently used to inform decisions about control and should therefore accurately capture the role played by asymptomatic carriers. In practice, incorporating asymptomatic carriers into models is challenging due to the sparsity of direct evidence. This absence of data leads to uncertainty in estimates of model parameters and, more fundamentally, in the selection of an appropriate model structure. To assess the implications of this uncertainty, we systematically reviewed published models of carriage and propose a new model of disease transmission with asymptomatic carriage. Analysis of our model shows how different assumptions about the role of asymptomatic carriers can lead to different conclusions about the transmission and control of disease. Critically, selecting an inappropriate model structure, even when parameters are correctly estimated, may lead to over- or under-estimates of intervention effectiveness. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission and highlight the importance of accurately incorporating carriers into models used to make decisions about disease control.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chisholm, Rebecca H.; Campbell, Patricia T.; Wu, Yue; Tong, Steven Y.

Measures of disease severity in the ferret include weight loss, temperature rise, sneezing, viral shedding and reduced activity. To date, the only available method for activity measurement has been the assignment of an arbitrary score by a \u2018blind\u2019 observer based on pre-defined responsiveness scale. This manual scoring method is subjective and can be prone to bias. In this study, we described a novel video-tracking methodology for determining activity changes in a ferret model of influenza infection. This method eliminates the various limitations of manual scoring, which include the need for a sole \u2018blind\u2019 observer and the requirement to recognise the \u2018normal\u2019 activity of ferrets in order to assign relative activity scores. In ferrets infected with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, video-tracking was more sensitive than manual scoring in detecting ferret activity changes. Using this video-tracking method, oseltamivir treatment was found to ameliorate the effect of influenza infection on activity in ferret. Oseltamivir treatment of animals was associated with an improvement in clinical symptoms, including reduced inflammatory responses in the upper respiratory tract, lower body weight loss and a smaller rise in body temperature, despite there being no significant reduction in viral shedding. In summary, this novel video-tracking is an easy-to-use, objective and sensitive methodology for measuring ferret activity.","publish_time":"2015-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Ding Yuan; Barr, Ian G.; Hurt, Aeron C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62dd39338a12f7b81ae4e79e030c238c9ddaedfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738900/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of ferrets","ferret activity changes","reduced activity","activity measurement","manual scoring method","relative activity scores","ferret model of influenza infection","novel video-tracking methodology","influenza virus infection","available method","effect of influenza infection","temperature rise","body temperature","sensitive methodology","observer","viral shedding","various limitations of manual scoring","lower body weight loss","similar clinical symptoms","Oseltamivir treatment of animals","smaller rise","pdm09 virus","reduced inflammatory responses","preferred animal model","upper respiratory tract","sneezing","transmission","order","virulence","objective","pre-defined responsiveness scale","pathogenesis","assignment","improvement","Measures of disease severity","need","H1N1","arbitrary score","significant reduction","requirement","summary","bias","humans","date","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children\u0027s Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parain\uFB02uenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3\u20137 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus in\uFB02uenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. in\uFB02uenzae contributed as major causes of disease. Commercially available multiplexing real-time PCR allowed for rapid detection of the etiological agent.","publish_time":"2015-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Tie-Gang; Li, Ai-Hua; Lyu, Min; Chen, Meng; Huang, Fang; Wu, Jiang","journal":"Chronic Dis Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af7445b0b1d408a96c5001e1e0ba1f05dc1934ca.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eab5c7409c1afb7a1c6357ed9d4fe4b0c3f2fa16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5643733.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095882X1500033X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29062995/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2015.06.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X1500033X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["RSV","pediatric patients","enrolled patients","rhinovirus","RT-PCR","available multiplexing real-time PCR","respiratory viruses","multiple viruses","multiple bacteria","Streptococcus pneumoniae","prevalence of pediatric CAP","available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR","majority of CAP","common viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","single viral pathogen","Viral pathogens","parain\uFB02uenza virus","etiological agent","bacteria coinfection","years of age","frequent pathogens","adenovirus","single bacterial pathogen","real-time polymerase chain reaction","Haemophilus in\uFB02uenzae","Beijing Children\u0027s Hospital","rapid detection","tracheal aspirate specimens","technique","etiology","major causes of disease","study","RESULTS","kits","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","aim","infections","contrast","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Microvesicles appear mostly to originate from multivesicular bodies or to bud from the plasma membrane. Here, we review the convergence of microvesicle biogenesis and aspects of viral assembly and release pathways. Herpesviruses and retroviruses, amongst others, recruit several elements from the microvesicle biogenesis pathways for functional virus release. In addition, noninfectious pleiotropic virus-like vesicles can be released, containing viral and cellular components. We highlight the heterogeneity of microvesicle function during viral infection, addressing microvesicles that can either block or enhance infection, or cause immune dysregulation through bystander action in the immune system. Finally, endogenous retrovirus and retrotransposon elements deposited in our genomes millions of years ago can be released from cells within microvesicles, suggestive of a viral origin of the microvesicle system or perhaps of an evolutionary conserved system of virus-vesicle codependence. More research is needed to further elucidate the complex function of the various microvesicles produced during viral infection, possibly revealing new therapeutic intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2012-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wurdinger, Thomas; Gatson, NaTosha N.; Balaj, Leonora; Kaur, Balveen; Breakefield, Xandra O.; Pegtel, D.

Presence of disease (treated and non-treated) was assessed clinically by farmers and by a project veterinarian visiting the farms every third week. The median S-Hp of healthy calves was 0.06g/L (80% central range: 0.04\u20130.23), of calves with diarrhoea within the 10 days before sampling 0.07g/L (80% central range: 0.04\u20130.63), and of calves with CRD within the 14 days before sampling 0.09g/L (80% central range: 0.04\u20130.69). Eight different cut-off values were used to define a positive S-Hp analysis result: \u003E0.05, \u003E0.06, \u003E0.07, \u003E0.08, \u003E0.09, \u003E0.10, \u003E0.15 and \u003E0.20g/L. A rectal temperature \u003E39.5\u00B0C was denoted as fever. A positive result of five different diagnostic tests for CRD was defined as: (1) a positive S-Hp with fever absent, (2) a positive S-Hp with fever present, (3) either a positive S-Hp or fever, (4) both a positive S-Hp and fever, and (5) fever (regardless of S-Hp). The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each test were calculated from regression coefficients of generalized linear mixed models of the binary test results, applying a logit link. Apart from CRD status (within the 14 days before sampling; no or yes), the models included sex (bull or heifer), and for the test based on S-Hp alone, also rectal temperature (fever, no or yes). Confidence intervals (CI) of Se and Sp were estimated by simulation. Based on Se, Sp, and areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, test 3 was considered the best. At optimal performance, giving equal importance to type I and II errors, i.e. at a S-Hp cut-off of 0.15g/L in heifer calves, Se was 0.64 (95% CI 0.50\u20130.77) and Sp 0.71 (95% CI 0.60\u20130.80), and at a S-Hp cut-off of 0.08g/L in bulls, Se was 0.52 (95% CI 0.40\u20130.64) and Sp 0.80 (95% CI 0.74\u20130.85). The other tests were judged as unsatisfactory indicators of CRD. In heifers, the proportion of CRD-positive calves in the herd was strongly associated with the proportion of test positives (S-Hp or fever; S-HP and fever), suggesting potential as a herd-level indicator.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Svensson, C.; Liberg, P.; Hultgren, J.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/737426d92c17fae536e2962344d3dfa2fafdd973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110846.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023306001559; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023306001559","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRD","Sp"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["S-Hp cut-off","median S-Hp","potential of S","positive S-Hp analysis result","positive calves","fever absent","fever present","positive result","heifer calves","proportion of CRD","healthy calves","dairy calves","CRD status","sampling","central range","proportion of test positives","unsatisfactory indicators of CRD","days of age","binary test results","rectal temperature","different cut-off values","herd-level indicator","different diagnostic tests","Presence of disease","indicator of clinical respiratory-tract disease","regression coefficients of generalized linear mixed models","areas","Receiver","Characteristics curves","herds","south-west Sweden","specificity","project veterinarian","equal importance","serum concentration of haptoglobin","logit link","farms","optimal performance","farmers","sex","Confidence intervals","group","diarrhoea","week","sensitivity","errors","heifers","simulation","bulls","best"],"language":"en"},

The gene sequence feature and gene expression patterns in various tissues and buds of the species were characterized. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 14 chlorogenic acid and luteolin biosynthesis-related genes were identified from the L. japonica transcriptome assembly. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the function of individual gene could be differentiation and induce active compound diversity. Their orthologous genes were also recognized in L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides genomic datasets, except for LHCHS1 and LMC4H2. The expression patterns of these genes are different in the tissues of L. japonica, L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides. Results also showed that CGAs were controlled in the first step of biosynthesis, whereas both steps controlled luteolin in the bud of L. japonica. The expression of LJFNS2 exhibited positive correlation with luteolin levels in L. japonica.

The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared. Results A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N = 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (p = 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups. The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n = 83) of patients had multiple viral infections. Overall, the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection was detected in multiple viral infections (79%). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was independently associated with multiple viral infections (p = 0.022), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (p = 0.001) and longer hospitalization duration (p = 0.011). Conclusion Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of developing LRTI. However, multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome. More studies are needed to unveil the interplay between the hosts and different viruses in multiple viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, Chun-Yu; Wu, Wan-Tai; Chang, Chia-Yuan; Wong, Ying-Chi; Lai, Chou-Cheng; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Wu, Keh-Gong; Hung, Miao-Chiu","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2480b2d6683049fbd9522d1b2e8dd1ea006fb122.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105047.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607575/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2019.08.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118219301483; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118219301483","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusion Multiple viral infections","single viral infection","Viral etiologies","lower respiratory infections","positive viral detection","negative viral detection","Lower respiratory tract infection","Abstract Background Acute respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","age of patients","xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","duration of fever","evidence of bacterial infection","shorter duration of hospitalization","longer hospitalization duration","younger age","highest percentage of human bocavirus infection","identified virus","clinical data","medical records of hospitalized children","lower rate of leukocytosis","different viruses","human rhinovirus","significant differences","worse disease outcome","higher risk of developing LRTI","test","RVP","antibiotics treatment","hosts","RSV","interplay","year period","Methods","groups","total","studies"],"language":"en"},

Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the PQS classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all PQS present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each PQS in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of PQS abundance.

E2 has complex and mannose-rich-type oligosaccharide side-chains, which are attached by N-glycosidic linkages to the polypeptide. Glycosylation of E2 is initiated at the co-translational level, and it is inhibited by tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-glucose, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose. Thus, E2 belongs to a glycoprotein type found in many other enveloped viruses. E1, in contrast, represents a different class of glycoprotein. The following observations indicate that its carbohydrate side-chains have 0-glycosidic linkage. (1) The constituent sugars of E1 are N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and neuraminic acid; mannose and fucose are absent. (2) The side-chains can be removed by \u03B2-elimination. (3) Glycosylation of E1 is not sensitive to the compounds interfering with N-glycosylation. E1 is the first viral glycoprotein analyzed that contains only 0-glycosidic linkages.

However, the efficacy and the safety of alternative salvage treatments are less guarauteed especially when patient experiences treatment failure and/or an adverse drug reactions (ADR). The purpose of this study is to recognize potential risk factors imitating successful treatment with TMP/SMX among PCP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety one adult patients diagnosed with PCP were included after searching electronical medical records from January 2013 through July 2015 at Asan Medical Center Seoul, Korea. We compared clinical characteristics and laboratory findings including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis in patients who experienced TMP/SMX treatment failure or ADR (the case group) versus those who did not (the control group). RESULTS: Among the enrolled PCP patients, 39 (42.9%) required salvage treatment owing to either treatment failure (28, 28.6%) and/or ADR (17, 18.7%). The BAL lymphocyte percentage (25% [IQR, 8\u201340%] vs. 47% [IQR, 15\u201362%]; P = 0.005) was lower in the case group. Diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.98, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.20\u201318.58), glomerular filtration rate \u226450 mL/min (aOR 4.48, 95% CI 1.08\u201318.66), and BAL lymphocyte percentage \u226445% (aOR 9.25, 95% CI 2.47\u201334.58) were independently associated with the case group in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that BAL lymphocyte count may play some role during PCP treatment. Further studies should be followed to reveal what the role of BAL lymphocyte is in the PCP treatment.","publish_time":"2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Tark; Sung, Heungsup; Chong, Yong Pil; Kim, Sung-Han; Choo, Eun Ju; Choi, Sang-Ho; Kim, Tae Hyong; Woo, Jun Hee; Kim, Yang Soo; Lee, Sang-Oh","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c71b86e38ae06503c1dc05abea7743ef3e7851e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6031595.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968978/; https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2018.50.2.110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Asan Medical Center","BAL"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["PCP treatment","SMX treatment failure","recommended treatment","successful treatment","role of BAL lymphocyte","BAL lymphocyte percentage","enrolled PCP patients","case group","BAL lymphocyte count","patient experiences treatment failure","TMP","aOR","ADR","adult patients","control group","study","IQR","fluid analysis","multivariate analysis","electronical medical records","safety of alternative salvage treatments","Asan Medical Center Seoul","bronchoalveolar lavage","laboratory findings","potential risk factors","adjusted odds ratio","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","clinical characteristics","Diabetes mellitus","Korea","Trimethoprim","sufamethoxazole","adverse drug reactions","confidence interval","efficacy","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","glomerular filtration rate","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","purpose","studies"],"language":"en"},

The structures of both the mPyV and SV40 alone and in complex with receptor fragments have been solved to high resolution. The majority of polyomaviruses recognize terminal sialic acid in either an \u03B12,3 linkage or an \u03B12,6 linkage to the underlying galactose. Studies on virus structure, receptor utilization and mechanisms of entry have led to new insights into how these viruses interact in an active way with cells to ensure the nuclear delivery and expression of their genomes. Critical work on virus entry has led to the discovery of a pH neutral endocytic compartment that accepts cargo from caveolae and to novel roles for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated factors in virus uncoating and penetration of ER membranes. This review will summarize the major findings and compare and contrast the mechanisms used by these viruses to infect cells.","publish_time":"2009-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neu, Ursula; Stehle, Thilo; Atwood, Walter J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d935444a4e3a8af17406c536e5483e63a95bafd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2663363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.12.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19157478/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208008131; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208008131","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BKV","ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus entry","virus uncoating","mechanisms of entry","characterization of virus receptors","characterization of polyomavirus structures","\u03B12","mPyV","monkey polyomavirus SV40","mouse polyomavirus","linkage","cells","review","field\u0027s major findings","receptor utilization","receptor fragments","mechanisms of host cell invasion","human polyomaviruses","majority of polyomaviruses","penetration of ER membranes","cargo","caveolae","novel roles","discovery","factors","pH neutral endocytic compartment","endoplasmic reticulum","terminal sialic acid","nuclear delivery","regard","Studies","complex","active way","new insights","attention","expression","genomes","JCV","BKV","Critical work","high resolution","underlying galactose","family","members"],"language":"en"},

There is a gap of knowledge conerning the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface in different localities in Egypt. Some zoonotic agents are \u201Cexotic\u201D for Egypt (e.g., MERS-CoV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), others are endemic (e.g., Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis and Avian influenza). Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens from and to Egypt occurred via different routes, mainly importation/exportation of apparently healthy animals or migratory birds. Control of the infectious agents and multidrug resistant bacteria in the veterinary sector is on the frontline for infection control in humans. The implementation of control programs significantly decreased the prevalence of some zoonoses, such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, in some localities within the country. Sustainable awareness, education and training targeting groups at high risk (veterinarians, farmers, abattoir workers, nurses, etc.) are important to lessen the burden of zoonotic diseases among Egyptians. There is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of these diseases in Egypt.","publish_time":"2017-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Helmy, Yosra A.; El-Adawy, Hosny; Abdelwhab, Elsayed M.","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d14958c8c606c6abc9d79a20721582b07f1fd704.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5617990.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens6030033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Asia","Europe","Middle East","Northern Africa","Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["infection control","zoonotic agents","epidemiology of zoonotic diseases","burden of zoonotic diseases","implementation of control programs","control regimes of common bacterial","different localities","Schistosomiasis","prevalence","humans","country","sources of human infection","Northern Africa","viral zoonoses","healthy animals","infectious agents","different routes","human-animal interface","old-world continents Africa","training targeting groups","veterinarians","high risk","Middle East","multidrug resistant bacteria","farmers","education","exportation","intervention plans","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus","veterinary sector","collaborative surveillance","highest population density","importation","MERS-CoV","unique geographical location","reservoirs","frontline","abattoir workers","urgent need","Sustainable awareness","gap of knowledge conerning","nurses","Brucellosis","Asia","Europe","migratory birds","Mediterranean basin","Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens","Avian influenza","fascioliasis","Egyptians","review"],"language":"en"},

Here we exhaustively examine all possible intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of HEV by systematic Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and LuMPIS screens, providing a basis for studying the function of these proteins in the viral replication cycle. Key PPIs correlate with the already published HEV 3D structure.

Furthermore, we determined the dissociation constant (K(d)) of ORF3 interactions with the viral helicase, papain-like protease and methylase, which suggest a regulatory function for ORF3 in orchestrating the formation of the replicase complex.

Nasopharyngeal specimens are frequently tested, but their sensitivity is suboptimal. This study evaluated the incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses in expectorated saliva using molecular assays. A total of 258 hospitalized adult patients with suspected respiratory infections were included. Their expectorated saliva was collected without the use of any special devices. In the first cohort of 159 patients whose nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) tested positive for respiratory viruses during routine testing, the viral load was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Seventeen percent of the patients (27/159) had higher viral loads in the saliva than in the NPA. The second cohort consisted of 99 patients whose NPAs tested negative for respiratory viruses using a direct immunofluorescence assay. Their NPA and saliva specimens were additionally tested using multiplex PCR. In these patients, the concordance rate by multiplex PCR between NPA and saliva was 83.8%. Multiplex PCR detected viruses in saliva samples from 16 patients, of which nine (56.3%) had at least one virus that was not detected in the NPA. Decisions on antiviral or isolation precautions would be affected by salivary testing in six patients. Although NPAs have high viral loads and remain the specimen of choice for most patients with respiratory virus infections, supplementary molecular testing of saliva can improve the clinical management of these patients.","publish_time":"2017-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Kelvin KW; Lu, Lu; Yip, Cyril CY; Poon, Rosana WS; Fung, Ami MY; Cheng, Andrew; Lui, Daniel HK; Ho, Deborah TY; Hung, Ivan FN; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1c3da8411eed001028326eb33acfb6bcdac877c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5520312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588283/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPA","Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expectorated saliva","saliva specimens","incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses","saliva samples","supplementary molecular testing of saliva","respiratory virus infections","hospitalized adult patients","multiplex PCR","suspected respiratory infections","avian influenza viruses","routine testing","salivary testing","Microbiological testing","NPAs","high viral loads","higher viral loads","Nasopharyngeal specimens","cohort","quantitative reverse transcription PCR","patient management","clinical management","molecular assays","nasopharyngeal aspirates","infection control","humans","specimen of choice","concordance rate","isolation precautions","epidemiological studies","novel coronaviruses","direct immunofluorescence assay","Emerging infectious diseases","Decisions","study","total","special devices","sensitivity","percent"],"language":"en"},

To date, however, such implants have mainly been developed as scaffolds to promote the regeneration of failing organs due to old age or congenital malformations. In the real world, however, infection or immunological issues often compromise patients. For example, bacterial and viral infections can result in uncontrolled immunopathological damage and lead to organ failure. Hence, there is a need for biomaterials and implants that not only promote regeneration but also address issues that are specific to compromised patients, such as infection and inflammation. Different strategies are needed to address the regeneration of organs that have been damaged by infection or inflammation for successful clinical translation. Therefore, the real quest is for multifunctional biomaterials with combined properties that can combat infections, modulate inflammation, and promote regeneration at the same time. These strategies will necessitate the inclusion of methodologies for management of the cellular and signaling components elicited within the local microenvironment. In the development of such biomaterials, strategies range from the inclusion of materials that have intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, such as the synthetic lipid polymer, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), to silver nanoparticles that have antibacterial properties, to inclusion of nano- and micro-particles in biomaterials composites that deliver active drugs. In this present review, we present examples of both kinds of materials in each group along with their pros and cons. Thus, as a promising next generation strategy to aid or replace tissue/organ transplantation, an integrated smart programmable platform is needed for regenerative medicine applications to create and/or restore normal function at the cell and tissue levels. Therefore, now it is of utmost importance to develop integrative biomaterials based on multifunctional biopolymers and nanosystem for their practical and successful clinical translation.","publish_time":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffith, May; Islam, Mohammad M.; Edin, Joel; Papapavlou, Georgia; Buznyk, Oleksiy; Patra, Hirak K.","journal":"Front Bioeng Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ed809f5b348f735454271411a4bef01bfad0734.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5016531.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2016.00071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multifunctional biomaterials","biomaterials composites","integrative biomaterials","regeneration of organs","inflammation","implants","regeneration of failing organs","inclusion of materials","inclusion of nano","inclusion of methodologies","combined properties","antibacterial properties","successful clinical translation","patients","strategies range","Different strategies","intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties","organ transplantation","multifunctional biopolymers","organ failure","viral infections","kinds of materials","present examples","tissue levels","present review","immunological issues","real quest","real world","severe shortage of available human donor organs","integrated smart programmable platform","uncontrolled immunopathological damage","nanosystem","old age","micro-particles","lead","synthetic lipid polymer","methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine","components","regenerative medicine applications","cell","management","congenital malformations","normal function","active drugs","MPC","generation strategy","group","nanoparticles","utmost importance","scaffolds","development","local microenvironment","need","pros","date","time"],"language":"en"},

It was found that for the use of a minimum ventilation rate of 10.3 L/s/person, the use of desiccant cooling system as compared to conventional system saved 4% of the energy and could achieve the desired space conditions. A parametric study under various ventilation rates indicated that use of desiccant cooling system in wet markets in hot and humid Hong Kong would lead to energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO2 emission reduction amounting from 1% to 13%. The savings were more evident when wet markets were designed for a ventilation rate of 20 L/s/person.

In aging research, mice are maintained until near end of life that, depending on strain and genetic manipulation, can be upwards of 33 months. Aging research has unique welfare issues related to age-related decline, debilitation, fragility, and associated pain of chronic diseases. An effective aging research program includes the collaboration and education of the research, husbandry, and veterinary staff, and of the members of the institution animal care and use committee. This collaborative effort is critical to humanely maintaining older mice and preventing excessive censorship due to non-lethal diseases. Part of the educational process is becoming familiar with how old mice appear clinically, at necropsy and histopathologically. This baseline knowledge is important in making the determination of humane end points, defining health span, contributing causes of death and effects of interventions. The goal of this paper is to introduce investigators to age-associated diseases and lesion patterns in mice from clinical presentation to pathologic assessment.

Over the past decade, a critical role for the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) in counteracting host immune factors during viral infection has emerged. This counteraction is commonly achieved by the expression of viral proteins capable of sequestering host ubiquitin E3 ligases and their regulators. In particular, many viruses hijack members of the Cullin-RING E3 Ligase (CRL) family. Viruses interact in many ways with CRLs in order to impact their ligase activity; one key recurring interaction involves re-directing CRL complexes to degrade host targets that are otherwise not degraded within host cells. Removal of host immune factors by this mechanism creates a more amenable cellular environment for viral propagation. To date, a small number of target host factors have been identified, many of which are degraded via a CRL-proteasome pathway. Substantial effort within the field is ongoing to uncover the identities of further host proteins targeted in this fashion and the underlying mechanisms driving their turnover by the UPS. Elucidation of these targets and mechanisms will provide appealing anti-viral therapeutic opportunities. This review is focused on the many methods used by viruses to perturb host CRLs, focusing on substrate sequestration and viral regulation of E3 activity.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahon, Cathal; Krogan, Nevan J.; Craik, Charles S.; Pick, Elah","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8134e0946079f5ef0bbbd7b65ce13657483b8160.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4279162.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biom4040897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ubiquitin Proteasome System","CRL","UPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","host CRLs","host targets","host pathways","host cells","counteracting host immune factors","Removal of host immune factors","viral infection","viral propagation","small number of target host factors","expression of viral proteins capable of sequestering host ubiquitin E3 ligases","viral regulation of E3 activity","ability of viruses","ligase activity","CRL complexes","UPS","CRL-proteasome pathway","appealing anti-viral therapeutic opportunities","Cullin-RING E3 Ligase","Ubiquitin Proteasome System","underlying mechanisms","key recurring interaction","substrate sequestration","critical role","amenable cellular environment","members","field","disease pathogenesis","order","identities","family","fashion","regulators","Substantial effort","past decade","date","turnover","methods","Elucidation","review","counteraction"],"language":"en"},

Research on CF infection has highlighted differences from other respiratory infections\u2014both in the range and the nature of the organisms\u2014especially in chronic infection. This is a rapidly advancing field of microbiology and is bringing insights into the complexity and adaptations of bacteria causing chronic infection in the respiratory tract. AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND CONTROVERSY: The epidemiology of some infections in CF has changed, with reduction in spread of Burkholderia cenocepacia following patient segregation. Conversely, epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have emerged, which spread between patients; previously, most P. aeruginosa strains were patient-specific. Studies on hypermutators, quorum sensing, biofilm growth and the development of molecular identification have shed light on pathogenicity, microbial adaptation to the host and complexity of infection in CF. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are emerging pathogens in CF; however, there is much to learn about pathogenicity and treatment of these infections. Species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, more commonly encountered in the upper tract, are found in significant numbers in CF sputum. The significance of this is however under debate. Finally, although the clinical relevance of conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing for chronic CF pathogens has been questioned, there are no clear alternatives. EMERGING AREAS FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Much has been learnt about pathogenicity, evolution of CF pathogens and development of antibiotic resistance. The need is to focus on clinical relevance of these observations to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment of CF infection.","publish_time":"2009-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foweraker, Juliet","journal":"Br Med Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d209ab3376e51cbc00442378d02f2538e6ecb95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109666.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldn050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of CF infection","chronic CF pathogens","chronic infection","CF sputum","evolution of CF pathogens","complexity of infection","pathogenicity","emerging pathogens","respiratory infections","patients","respiratory tract","aeruginosa strains","EMERGING AREAS","development of antibiotic resistance","clinical relevance of conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing","adaptations of bacteria","patient segregation","anaerobic bacteria","patient-specific","epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa","DEVELOPING RESEARCH","AREAS OF AGREEMENT","upper tract","development of molecular identification","spread of Burkholderia cenocepacia","biofilm growth","Non-tuberculous mycobacteria","mortality","light","major cause of morbidity","quorum sensing","hypermutators","microbial adaptation","diagnosis","host","prevention","differences","significant numbers","cystic fibrosis","insights","observations","CONTROVERSY","range","reduction","organisms","epidemiology","Studies","Species of aerobic","INTRODUCTION","advancing field of microbiology","nature","need","significance","debate","clear alternatives"],"language":"en"},

Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human.

However, the impact of digestive system diseases have not been issued. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Jin-yin tan hospital, Wuhan, China between January 26th , 2020 and February 21st . The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was used to assess the presence and severity of LPRD. A RSI \u003E13 is considered to be abnormal. RESULTS A total of 95 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, with 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), and 6.3% (6/95) being moderately ill, severely ill, and critically ill, respectively. In this study, 38.9% (37/95) of the patient had a RSI score over 13, which was indicative of LPRD. In a univariable analysis, the age and RSI scores of severely or critically ill patients were statistically significantly higher than patients with moderate disease (p=0.026 and p=0.005, respectively). After controlling for age difference in a multivariable model, the RSI\u003E13, compared with RSI=0, was associated with significantly higher risk of severe infection (p\u003C0.001; OR = 11.411, 95% CI 2.95-42.09) and critical infection (p=0.028; OR = 19.61, 95% CI 1.38-277.99). CONCLUSIONS Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, RSI score greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.

Glial cell function is tightly controlled by cellular interactions in which cytokines are important messengers. Recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. During the course of CNS diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and in the corresponding animal models, the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation, arguing for an important role of these chemokines and their corresponding receptor CXCR3 in glial activation. To clarify the role of this chemokine system in glial cell activation, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 on glial activation in a model of toxic demyelination in which glial activation without a prominent influx of hematogenous cells is prototypical. METHODS: We investigated the impact of CXCR3 on cuprizone-induced demyelination, comparing CXCR3-deficient mice with wild type controls. The clinical course during cuprizone feeding was documented for five weeks and for the subsequent four days withdrawal of the cuprizone diet (5.5 weeks). Glial activation was characterized using histological, histomorphometric and phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis for (de)myelination and neuroinflammation was applied to characterize the effect of cuprizone on CXCR3-deficient mice and control animals. RESULTS: CXCR3-deficient mice displayed a milder clinical course during cuprizone feeding and a more rapid body weight recovery after offset of diet. In the CNS, CXCR3 deficiency significantly attenuated the accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a deficiency of CXCR3 reduced the expression of the microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. Compared to controls, we observed a vast reduction of RNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines like Ccl2, Cxcl10, Tnf and Il6 within the CNS of cuprizone-treated mice. Lastly, CXCR3 deficiency had no major effects on the course of demyelination during cuprizone feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The CXCR3 chemokine system is critically involved in the intrinsic glial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination, which significantly modulates the distribution of glial cells and the local cytokine milieu.","publish_time":"2014-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krauthausen, Marius; Saxe, Simon; Zimmermann, Julian; Emrich, Michael; Heneka, Michael T; M\u00FCller, Marcus","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cdbf5aaebee9f6b33cb9fbbdcd1a68d53727289.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4096537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930935/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-11-109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glial cell activation","intrinsic glial activation","sites of glial activation","CXCR3 deficiency","deficiency of CXCR3","impact of CXCR3","CXCR3-deficient mice","activation of microglia","CNS of cuprizone","cuprizone feeding","distribution of glial cells","cuprizone diet","cuprizone-induced demyelination","CXCR3 chemokine system","course of demyelination","effect of cuprizone","corresponding receptor CXCR3","functional state of glial cells","important modulators of glial cell function","course of CNS diseases","microglial activation markers CD45","course of neuroinflammatory","milder clinical course","particular chemokines","chemokines CXCL9","treated mice","important role","model of toxic demyelination","CXCL10","important messengers","astrocytes","weeks","proinflammatory cytokines","prominent influx of hematogenous cells","neurodegenerative diseases","offset of diet","major effects","beneficial effects","phenotypic analysis","Molecular analysis","corresponding animal models","wild type controls","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","Ccl2","multiple sclerosis","expression","vast reduction of RNA levels","rapid body weight recovery","evidence","cellular interactions","Tnf","Il6","accumulation","days withdrawal","local cytokine milieu","CD11b","histomorphometric","control animals","Recent studies","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","neuroinflammation","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic E.coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways: as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs. An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated E.coli. It is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among E. coli isolates. Growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luppi, Andrea","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ce32d388ce40b7b9645329a2a2f0edfff7367ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5547460.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-017-0063-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28794894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["ETEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis","fimbriae F4","neonatal colibacillosis","differential diagnosis","important disease","Definitive diagnosis","ETEC responsible","coli isolates","heat labile toxin","process of enteric infection","rational use of antibiotics","heat stable toxin b","antimicrobial sensitivity tests","isolation","Intestinal infection","ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea","quantification","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","different methods of control","k88","diagnostic approach","use of antimicrobials","outbreak","confirmation of appropriate virulence factors","increase of antimicrobial resistance","appropriate sampling","results of bacteriology","isolated E","pathogenic E","semi-quantitative bacteriology","potential different causes","porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells","specific receptors","enterocytes","STb","metaphylactic treatment","swine","F5","main ways","therapeutic purposes","presence of characteristic lesions","issues","F6","k99","significant economic losses","F41","antibiotic therapy","demonstration","PCR","epidemiology","fundamental importance","Growing concern","diseased pigs","practitioners","F18","correct understanding","bacteria","enterotoxins","Knowledge","farmers","role","pathogenesis","colonization"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown that PEDV ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein. However, its influence on cell cycle and subcellular structure still require more research. In this study, we developed a Vero cell line that stably expresses PEDV ORF3 gene. Subcellular localization and influences of PEDV ORF3 on host cells were investigated. We further verified whether or not this gene enhances virus production. The results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein localizes in the cytoplasm and affects cell cycle progression by prolonging the S phase. In addition, the ORF3-expressing Vero cells had more vesicles than the host Vero cells. Furthermore, the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV could grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. Methods One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. Results Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (\u03C1=.20 and .19, respectively, P\u003C.05) and physical symptoms (\u03C1=.21 and .19, P\u003C.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (\u03C1=.33, P\u003C.001) and sick days (\u03C1=.21, P\u003C.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator. Conclusions This study corroborates evidence that attachment insecurity is associated with sleep disturbance and extends this association to the occurrence of physical symptoms and time off work due to sickness among workers in a high-stress occupation.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maunder, Robert G.; Hunter, Jonathan J.; Lancee, William J.","journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ba2cfade3c68f45d3720382232de1663365f6db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094288.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.09.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399910003831; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399910003831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physical health","attachment anxiety","attachment avoidance","Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms","occurrence of physical symptoms","high risk of sleep disturbance","measures of health","sleep-related items","health outcomes","global sleep quality acting","health-care workers","Abstract Objective Adult attachment insecurity","sick days","self-report measures of adult attachment","perceived general health","mediation analyses","relationship","hypothesis of mediation","study","nondepressed female hospital workers","partial mediator","stronger mediator","sequential regression analyses","high-stress occupation","impairment","time","association","sickness","group","evidence","Methods","Conclusions","purpose"],"language":"en"},

At \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting sites, several types of pseudoknot have been identified which differ in their organisation and functionality. The pseudoknot found in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is typical of those that possess a long stem 1 of 11-12 bp and a long loop 2 (30-164 nt). A second group of pseudoknots are distinguishable that contain stems of only 5 to 7 bp and shorter loops. The NMR structure of one such pseudoknot, that of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), has revealed that it is kinked at the stem 1-stem 2 junction, and that this kinked conformation is essential for efficient frameshifting. We recently investigated the effect on frameshifting of modulating stem 1 length and stability in IBV-based pseudoknots, and found that a stem 1 with at least 11 bp was needed for efficient frameshifting. Here, we describe the sequence manipulations that are necessary to bypass the requirement for an 11 bp stem 1 and to convert a short non-functional IBV-derived pseudoknot into a highly efficient, kinked frameshifter pseudoknot. Simple insertion of an adenine residue at the stem 1-stem 2 junction (an essential feature of a kinked pseudoknot) was not sufficient to create a functional pseudoknot. An additional change was needed: efficient frameshifting was recovered only when the last nucleotide of loop 2 was changed from a G to an A. The requirement for an A at the end of loop 2 is consistent with a loop-helix contact similar to those described in other RNA tertiary structures. A mutational analysis of both partners of the proposed interaction, the loop 2 terminal adenine residue and two G\u00B7C pairs near the top of stem 1, revealed that the interaction was essential for efficient frameshifting. The specific requirement for a 3\u2032-terminal A residue was lost when loop 2 was increased from 8 to 14 nt, suggesting that the loop-helix contact may be required only in those pseudoknots with a short loop 2.","publish_time":"1999-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liphardt, Jan; Napthine, Sawsan; Kontos, Harry; Brierley, Ian","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4e03c82e343ee7d2b37096dbac5fbf84d783aa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141562.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228369992689X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228369992689X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bp stem","kinked pseudoknot","efficient frameshifting","long stem","frameshifting of modulating stem","short loop","long loop","end of loop","nucleotide of loop","types of pseudoknot","functional pseudoknot","kinked frameshifter pseudoknot","loop-helix contact","short non-functional IBV-derived pseudoknot","IBV-based pseudoknots","ribosomal frameshifting sites","kinked conformation","group of pseudoknots","terminal adenine residue","Abstract RNA pseudoknots","essential feature","junction","specific requirement","proposed interaction","infectious bronchitis virus","RNA tertiary structures","mouse mammary tumor virus","stability","length","structural elements","C pairs","partners","MMTV","Simple insertion","stems","additional change","effect","variety of biological processes","mutational analysis","sequence manipulations","shorter loops","NMR structure","organisation","functionality"],"language":"en"},

Since structural models from experiments are still lacking, computational methods can be challenged to generate such models. In this study, a \u2018sequential approach\u2019 for the assembly is proposed in which the individual TMDs are assembled one by one. This protocol is compared with a concerted protocol in which all TMDs are assembled simultaneously. The role of the loops between the TMDs during assembly of the monomers into a bundle is investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations for 20 ns are performed as a short equilibration to assess the bundle stability in a lipid environment. The results suggest that bundles are likely with the second TMD facing the putative pore. All the putative bundles show water molecules trapped within the lumen of the pore with only occasional events of complete crossing.

Classification of IBV is important for implementation of vaccination strategies to control the disease in commercial poultry. Currently, the lengthy process of sequence analysis of the IBV S1 gene is considered the gold standard for IBV strain identification, with a high nucleotide identity (e.g. \u226595%) indicating related strains. However, this gene has a high propensity to mutate and/or undergo recombination, and alone it may not be reliable for strain identification. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined with high-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis was developed based on the 3\u2032UTR of IBV for rapid detection and classification of IBV from commercial poultry. HRM curves generated from 230 to 435-bp PCR products of several IBV strains were subjected to further analysis using a mathematical model also developed during this study. It was shown that a combination of HRM curve analysis and the mathematical model could reliably group 189 out of 190 comparisons of pairs of IBV strains in accordance with their 3\u2032UTR and S1 gene identities. The newly developed RT-PCR/HRM curve analysis model could detect and rapidly identify novel and vaccine-related IBV strains, as confirmed by S1 gene and 3\u2032UTR nucleotide sequences. This model is a rapid, reliable, accurate and non-subjective system for detection of IBVs in poultry flocks.","publish_time":"2009-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hewson, Kylie; Noormohammadi, Amir H.; Devlin, Joanne M.; Mardani, Karim; Ignjatovic, Jagoda","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/341192a37fe4b204f5c268b4f703db8688fde590.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086978.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0357-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","HRM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UTR of IBV","Classification of IBV","IBV S1 gene","IBV strain identification","HRM curve analysis model","vaccine-related IBV strains","combination of HRM curve analysis","related strains","mathematical model","commercial poultry","S1 gene identities","developed RT-PCR","HRM curves","poultry flocks","rapid detection","lengthy process of sequence analysis","high morbidity","high nucleotide identity","UTR nucleotide sequences","high propensity","bp PCR products","detection of IBVs","non-subjective system","gold standard","reproductive diseases","high-resolution melt","implementation of vaccination strategies","coronavirus","novel","real-time polymerase chain reaction","accordance","comparisons of pairs","Infectious bronchitis virus","study","recombination"],"language":"en"},

An experimental platform was established to test its performance. Results show that the SDEATHP system can obtain higher fresh air supply temperature in winter and lower fresh air supply temperature in summer. The system requires only 3.12 W of power for the fans, and the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach 50.6 and 57.9, respectively. The optimal operating current and voltage of TE modules and photovoltaic system is analyzed, and then the number and types of electrical connections for the TE modules in SDEATHP system are discussed.

To further understand the role of host cell proteins in Vpu function, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening and identified a previously reported Vpu-interacting host factor, small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGTA). While RNAi-mediated depletion of SGTA did not significantly affect levels of tetherin or virus release efficiency, we observed that overexpression of SGTA inhibited HIV-1 release in a Vpu- and tetherin-independent manner. Overexpression of SGTA in the presence of Vpu, but not in its absence, resulted in a marked stabilization and cytosolic relocalization of a 23-kDa, non-glycosylated tetherin species. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that non-glycosylated tetherin is stabilized through the formation of a ternary SGTA/Vpu/tetherin complex. This accumulation of non-glycosylated tetherin is due to inhibition of its degradation, independent of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Because the SGTA-stabilized tetherin species is partially localized to the cytosol, we propose that overexpression of SGTA in the presence of Vpu blocks the translocation of tetherin across the ER membrane, resulting in cytosolic accumulation of a non-glycosylated tetherin species. Although our results do not provide support for a physiological function of SGTA in HIV-1 replication, they demonstrate that SGTA overexpression regulates tetherin expression and stability, thus providing insights into the function of SGTA in ER translocation and protein degradation.","publish_time":"2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waheed, Abdul A.; MacDonald, Scott; Khan, Maisha; Mounts, Megan; Swiderski, Maya; Xu, Yue; Ye, Yihong; Freed, Eric O.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a3a68a67776a01043a6a156b69be803c7118a6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4840321.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27103333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SGTA overexpression","translocation of tetherin","SGTA-stabilized tetherin species","tetherin expression","levels of tetherin","tetherin complex","ternary SGTA","non-glycosylated tetherin species","accumulation of non-glycosylated tetherin","Vpu function","physiological function of SGTA","tetherin-independent manner","presence of Vpu","overexpression of SGTA inhibited HIV","host restriction factor tetherin","reported Vpu","accessory protein Vpu","RNAi-mediated depletion of SGTA","protein degradation","host factor","ER translocation","ER-associated degradation","virus release efficiency","ER membrane","cytosolic accumulation","role of host cell proteins","cytosolic relocalization","small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat","kDa","stability","inhibition","formation","marked stabilization","ERAD","yeast","support","insights","Coimmunoprecipitation studies","replication","hybrid screening","pathway","absence","results"],"language":"en"},

Objective We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. Conclusions Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albarello, Fabrizio; Pianura, Elisa; Di Stefano, Federica; Cristofaro, Massimo; Petrone, Ada; Marchioni, Luisa; Palazzolo, Claudia; Schinin\u00E0, Vincenzo; Nicastri, Emanuele; Petrosillo, Nicola; Campioni, Paolo; Eskild, Petersen; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Abbonizio, Maria Alessandra; Agrati, Chiara; Amadei, Gioia; Amendola, Alessandra; Antonini, Mario; Barbaro, Raffaella; Bartolini, Barbara; Benigni, Martina; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Bordi, Licia; Bordoni, Veronica; Branca, Marta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Caporale, Cinzia; Caravella, Ilaria; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Chiappini, Roberta; Ciaralli, Carmine; Colavita, Francesca; Corpolongo, Angela; Curiale, Salvatore; D\u2019Abramo, Alessandra; Dantimi, Cristina; Angelis, Alessia De; Angelis, Giada De; Lorenzo, Rachele Di; Stefano, Federica Di; Ferraro, Federica; Fiorentini, Lorena; Frustaci, Andrea; Gall\u00EC, Paola; Garotto, Gabriele; Giancola, Maria Letizia; Giansante, Filippo; Giombini, Emanuela; Greci, Maria Cristina; Lalle, Eleonora; Lanini, Simone; Lapa, Daniele; Lepore, Luciana; Lucia, Andrea; Lufrani, Franco; Macchione, Manuela; Marani, Alessandra; Mariano, Andrea; Marini, Maria Cristina; Maritti, Micaela; Matusali, Giulia; Meschi, Silvia; Montaldo, Francesco Messina Chiara; Murachelli, Silvia; Noto, Roberto; Pallini, Emanuele; Passeri, Virgilio; Pelliccioni, Federico; Petrecchia, Antonella; Pisciotta, Maria; Pittalis, Silvia; Proietti, Costanza; Puro, Vincenzo; Rinonapoli, Gabriele; Rueca, Martina; Sacchi, Alessandra; Sanasi, Francesco; Santagata, Carmen; Scarcia, Silvana; Scognamiglio, Paola; Scorzolini, Laura; Stazi, Giulia; Vaia, Francesco; Vairo, Francesco; Valli, Maria Beatrice","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71c14c4b2d5b2a765f43ce1dfbfbfaa80d18c409.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110436.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32112966/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220301016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220301016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["new lung infiltrates","early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment","initial lung deterioration","common early chest imaging findings of lung pathology","early alert radiological sign","multi-segmental extension of lung opacities","pulmonary vessels enlargement","radiological pattern","remarkable imaging findings","follow-up CT scan","enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels","new insurgent pulmonary lesion","MERS-CoV infected patients","increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates","chest X-Rays","CT scans","SARS-COV2","recent case reports","presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy","center","areas","progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome","ARDS","short-axis oval nodes","novel Coronavirus","pleural effusions","sudden caliber reduction","infection","Abstract Introduction","COVID","severe progression","uncommon element","Wuhan","Italy","Objective","China","dichotomic tracts","literature","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of all nine APMV serotypes in hamsters. The hamsters were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for clinical disease, pathology, histopathology, virus replication, and seroconversion. On the basis of one or more of these criteria, each of the APMV serotypes was found to replicate in hamsters. The APMVs produced mild or inapparent clinical signs in hamsters except for APMV-9, which produced moderate disease. Gross lesions were observed over the pulmonary surface of hamsters infected with APMV-2 \u0026 -3, which showed petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages, respectively. Replication of all of the APMVs except APMV-5 was confirmed in the nasal turbinates and lungs, indicating a tropism for the respiratory tract. Histologically, the infection resulted in lung lesions consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity and nasal turbinates with blunting or loss of cilia of the epithelium lining the nasal septa. The majority of APMV-infected hamsters exhibited transient histological lesions that self resolved by 14 days post infection (dpi). All of the hamsters infected with the APMVs produced serotype-specific HI or neutralizing antibodies, confirming virus replication. Taken together, these results demonstrate that all nine known APMV serotypes are capable of replicating in hamsters with minimal disease and pathology.","publish_time":"2011-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samuel, Arthur S; Subbiah, Madhuri; Shive, Heather; Collins, Peter L; Samal, Siba K","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1686765b6847c2b132d0129be10f7263bac5973e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3052182.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345199/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-42-38","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected hamsters","majority of APMV","APMVs","case of APMV","known APMV serotypes","virus replication","pulmonary surface of hamsters","nasal turbinates","clinical disease","Gross lesions","minimal disease","nasal septa","moderate disease","infection of non-avian species","lung lesions consistent","transient histological lesions","days post infection","Avian paramyxoviruses","inapparent clinical signs","bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity","self","capable of replicating","blunting","neutralizing antibodies","histopathology","serotype-specific HI","loss of cilia","wild birds","tropism","epithelium","world","lungs","seroconversion","pathogenicity","human vaccine vectors","ecchymotic hemorrhages","respiratory tract","results","criteria","study","basis"],"language":"en"},

Our previous study showed that the CD8(\u002B) T-cell epitope aa129\u2013aa137 (FVVPILLKA, FA9) of the Hantaan virus (HTNV) nucleoprotein (NP), restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02, induced specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses that controlled HTNV infection in humans. However, the in vivo immunogenicity of peptide FA9 and the effect of FA9-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell immunity remain unclear. Here, based on a detailed structural analysis of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex and functional investigations using HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic (Tg) mice, we found that the overall structure of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex displayed a typical MHC class I fold with Val2 and Ala9 as primary anchor residues and Val3 and Leu7 as secondary anchor residues that allow peptide FA9 to bind tightly with an HLA-A*0201 molecule. Residues in the middle portion of peptide FA9 extruding out of the binding groove may be the sites that allow for recognition by T-cell receptors. Immunization with peptide FA9 in HLA-A2.1/K(b) Tg mice induced FA9-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses characterized by the induction of high expression levels of interferon-\u03B3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, granzyme B, and CD107a. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant reductions in the levels of both the antigens and the HTNV RNA loads were observed in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of Tg mice pre-vaccinated with peptide FA9. Thus, our findings highlight the ability of HTNV epitope-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell immunity to control HTNV and support the possibility that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide, naturally processed in vivo in an HLA-A*02-restriction manner, may be a good candidate for the development HTNV peptide vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Ying; Cheng, Linfeng; Yuan, Bin; Zhang, Yusi; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yun; Tang, Kang; Zhuang, Ran; Chen, Lihua; Yang, Kun; Zhang, Fanglin; Jin, Boquan","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/729e5d420ec1a80d31928dc8bb261610a93aa890.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4976285.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27551282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTNV","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTNV-NP FA9 peptide","immunogenicity of peptide FA9","effect of FA9","middle portion of peptide FA9","FA9-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses","development HTNV peptide vaccines","T-cell immunity","HTNV infection","HLA-A2","T-cell receptors","ability of HTNV epitope-specific CD8","T-cell epitope aa129","HTNV challenge trial","HTNV RNA loads","secondary anchor residues","primary anchor residues","granzyme B","humans","complex","kidneys of Tg mice pre-vaccinated","induction of high expression levels of interferon","high mortality rates","Val3","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","Val2","Leu7","Ala9","good candidate","FVVPILLKA","aa137","severe emerging diseases","significant reductions","Hantaan virus","Hantavirus infections","typical MHC class","detailed structural analysis","liver","sites","spleen","antigens","nucleoprotein","functional investigations","recognition","overall structure","possibility","human leukocyte antigen","binding groove","global public health concern","restriction manner","CD107a","findings","Immunization","previous study","molecule"],"language":"en"},

We obtain the average case fatality ratio and the daily quarantine rate for the Taiwan outbreak. Model simulations is utilized to show that Level A quarantine prevented approximately 461 additional SARS cases and 62 additional deaths, while the effect of Level B quarantine was comparatively minor, yielding only around 5% reduction of cases and deaths.

In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagy-inducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide- and pimozide-treated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy. These findings emphasize the lethal function and potential clinical relevance of hyperactivated autophagy in GBM.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zielke, Svenja; Meyer, Nina; Mari, Muriel; Abou-El-Ardat, Khalil; Reggiori, Fulvio; van Wijk, Sjoerd J.

In response, a decision was made by the neonatal neuro-developmental follow up (NNFU) clinic staff to select patients with scheduled appointments to have a mail/telephone assessment using Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) or to postpone/skip their visit. The objective of this study was to compare the developmental assessment and its outcome in two groups of NNFU clinic patients, SARS versus non-SARS, over three standard clinic appointments. METHODS: We compared the diagnostic accuracy (identification of developmental delay), and patient management (referral for therapy or communication of a new diagnosis) of the strategies used during SARS, April/May 2003, to the standard assessment methods used for patients seen in April/May 2005 (non-SARS). In all cases data were obtained for 3 patient visits: before, during and after these 2 months and were compared using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 95 patients in the SARS group and 99 non-SARS patients. The gestational age, sex, entry diagnosis and age at the clinic visit was not different between the groups. The NNFU clinic staff mailed ASQ to 27 families during SARS, 17 (63%) were returned, and 8 of the 17 were then contacted by telephone. Criteria used to identify infants at risk selected for either mailed ASQ or phone interviews were not clearly defined in the patients\u0027 charts. There was a significant under identification of developmental delay during SARS (18% versus 45%). Of those who responded to the mailed questionnaire, referrals for therapy rates were similar to non-SARS group. The lost to follow up rate was 24% for the SARS group compared with 7% for non-SARS. There was no difference in the overall rate of developmental delay in the two groups as identified at the \u0027after\u0027 visit. CONCLUSIONS: Poor advanced planning led to a haphazard assessment of patients during this infectious disease outbreak. Future pandemic plans should consider planning for outpatient care as well as in hospital management of patients.","publish_time":"2010-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasef, Nehad; O\u0027Brien, Karel; Wylie, Lesley; Unger, Sharon","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa47af75688fa3fab2afde5ed3f1a7fdd9624746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2914048.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-10-51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Stages Questionnaire","NNFU","SARS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["non-SARS patients","non-SARS group","developmental assessment","groups of NNFU clinic patients","haphazard assessment of patients","clinic visit","hospital management of patients","NNFU clinic staff","identification of developmental delay","standard clinic appointments","telephone assessment","ASQ","overall rate of developmental delay","standard assessment methods","mailed questionnaire","neonatal neuro-developmental","patient management","infectious disease outbreak","therapy rates","entry diagnosis","new diagnosis","outpatient clinics","outpatient care","Stages Questionnaire","gestational age","SickKids Hospital","scheduled appointments","patient visits","disease transmission","Poor advanced planning","Toronto","severe acute respiratory syndrome","sex","communication","referrals","diagnostic accuracy","outcome","BACKGROUND","families","decision","Future pandemic plans","CONCLUSIONS","risk","difference","strategies","study","cases data","months","descriptive statistics","Criteria","infants","phone interviews","patients\u0027 charts","response","objective","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. AIM: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. METHODS: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT(90)) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. RESULTS: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT(90) were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT(90) tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. CONCLUSION: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT(90), is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perera, Ranawaka APM; Mok, Chris KP; Tsang, Owen TY; Lv, Huibin; Ko, Ronald LW; Wu, Nicholas C; Yuan, Meng; Leung, Wai Shing; Chan, Jacky MC; Chik, Thomas SH; Choi, Chris YC; Leung, Kathy; Chan, Kin Ho; Chan, Karl CK; Li, Ka-Chi; Wu, Joseph T; Wilson, Ian A; Monto, Arnold S; Poon, Leo LM; Peiris, Malik","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a803382aed35854df7cd56f1e308fbd75681d1b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347204/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.16.2000421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRNT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRNT","MN tests","IgG ELISA","IgM RBD ELISA","age-stratified sera","health systems","age-stratified controls","SARS-CoV","antibody","public health interventions","large-scale sero-epidemiology studies","large-scale sero-epidemiological studies","public health decision making","plaque reduction neutralisation tests","ongoing coronavirus disease","virus challenge dose","IgM antibodies","confirmed COVID","healthy controls","spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","tissue culture infectious dose challenge","estimating disease severity","interpretation of neutralisation test","population","detectable cross-reactivity","pandemic","illness onset","real time","serological assays applicable","receptor-binding domain","combination","herd immunity","infectivity","major impacts","confirmatory microneutralisation","valid approach","specificity","days","economy","RESULTS","infection attack rates","sensitivity","society","BACKGROUND","patients","objective","Heparinised plasma","confirmation","CONCLUSION","AIM","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

A series of independent studies demonstrated that snoRNAs, as well as other noncoding RNAs, serve as the source of various short regulatory RNAs. Some snoRNAs and their fragments can also participate in the regulation of alternative splicing and posttranscriptional modification of mRNA. Alterations in snoRNA expression in human cells can affect numerous vital cellular processes.

Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by post-synthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated with their specific in situ detection. Here, we show that dual-function hemagglutinin-esterase envelope proteins of nidoviruses distinguish between a variety of closely related O-Ac-Sias. By using soluble forms of hemagglutinin-esterases as lectins and sialate-O-acetylesterases, we demonstrate differential expression of distinct O-Ac-sialoglycan populations in an organ-, tissue- and cell-specific fashion.

While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by 15N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the micelle and rotated by \u223C70\u00B0 around its helix axis in the negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might form the basis for peptide\u2013peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively charged microbial cell walls.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kosol, Simone; Zangger, Klaus","journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c811293dba2338156667d3003f2aaf7b6cd204eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128155.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20045466/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2009.12.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847709003530; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847709003530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Maximin"],"organizations":["NMR","DPC","SDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide interactions","residue peptide maximin H6","membrane surrogate","SDS","membrane disruption","DPC","membrane-mimetic systems","N relaxation measurements","paramagnetic relaxation enhancements","Bombinae family","structural properties of cationic \u03B1-helical peptides","micelles","attacks gram-negative bacteria","preferential attack","NMR spectroscopy","sodium dodecyl sulphate","similar structures","skin secretions of frogs","neutral dodecylphosphocholine","microbial cell walls","different membranes","GxxxG motif","order","basis","helix axis","surface","Abstract","addition"],"language":"en"},

These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to provide the editorial team with an enlightened vision to select the best papers. Results: Among the 843 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, two were finally selected as best papers. The first one analyzes the relationship between the disease, social/mass media, and public emotions to understand public overreaction (leading to a noticeable reduction of social and economic activities) in the context of a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea in 2015. The second paper concerns a new methodology to de-identify patient notes in electronic health records based on artificial neural networks that outperformed existing methods.

The disease can cause pulmonary, renal, hematological, and gastrointestinal complications. In this paper, we report neurological complications of MERS-CoV in two adult patients, and we hypothesize the pathophysiology. The first patient had an intracerebral hemorrhage as a result of thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet dysfunction. The second case was a case of critical illness polyneuropathy complicating a long ICU stay. In these cases, the neurological complications were secondary to systemic complications and long ICU stay.

We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p \u003C 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p \u003C 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the top 5% (n = 8) most reactive human samples tested by ELISA were HCoV-NL63 positive by immunofluorescence testing.

None of the top 5% most ELISA reactive livestock samples were positive for HCoV-NL63-related viruses by immunofluorescence confirmation.

The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2\u00B1569.4 vs. 874.9\u00B1589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.5\u00B163.9 vs. 120.2\u00B146.7 pg/mL, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection. These cytokines may act through their respective pro-inflammatory pathways to aggravate the allergic status and induce airway hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia pneumonia in atopic children.","publish_time":"2011-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeong, You-Cheol; Yeo, Mun-Soo; Kim, Joo-Hwa; Lee, Ha-Baik; Oh, Jae-Won","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2ca9692b72a2906ba55413293f79a98a7be0eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3283799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22379604/; https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2012.4.2.92","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia pneumonia","viral pneumonia","pneumonia infection","Serum levels of IL","Serum levels of VEGF","Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","non-atopic children","admission phase","group IV","clinical recovery phase","groups","serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor","changes","airway hypersensitivity","RESULTS","pg","asthma exacerbation","chronic asthma","allergic status","airway remodeling","human studies","Previous studies","development of hypersensitivity","present study","allergic lung inflammation","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","atypical bacterial infections","disease severity","evidence","mechanisms","respective pro-inflammatory pathways","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","cytokine expression","interleukin","PURPOSE","total","CONCLUSIONS","cytokines","METHODS","patients"],"language":"en"},

The mtDNA reference sequences were established on the basis of the complete sequences of two diseased and two nondiseased animals as well as partial sequences of 26 further individuals. The A. jubatus mitochondrial genome is 17,047-bp long and shows a high sequence similarity (91%) to the domestic cat. Based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the control region (CR) and pedigree information, the 18 myelopathic and 12 non-myelopathic cheetahs included in this study were classified into haplotypes I, II and III. In view of the phenotypic comparability of the neurodegenerative disease observed in cheetahs and human mtDNA-associated diseases, specific coding regions including the tRNAs leucine UUR, lysine, serine UCN, and partial complex I and V sequences were screened. We identified a heteroplasmic and a homoplasmic SNP at codon 507 in the subunit 5 (MTND5) of complex I. The heteroplasmic haplotype I-specific valine to methionine substitution represents a nonconservative amino acid change and was found in 11 myelopathic and eight non-myelopathic cheetahs with levels ranging from 29% to 79%. The homoplasmic conservative amino acid substitution valine to alanine was identified in two myelopathic animals of haplotype II. In addition, a synonymous SNP in the codon 76 of the MTND4L gene was found in the single haplotype III animal. The amino acid exchanges in the MTND5 gene were not associated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative disease in captive cheetahs.","publish_time":"2004-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burger, Pamela A; Steinborn, Ralf; Walzer, Christian; Petit, Thierry; Mueller, Mathias; Schwarzenberger, Franz","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e38a20d75af722bbd918bcbafadabd67094865.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126587.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111904003117; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111904003117","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-myelopathic cheetahs","captive cheetahs","myelopathic animals of haplotype","partial sequences","complete sequences","mtDNA reference sequences","heteroplasmic haplotype","V sequences","single haplotype","neurodegenerative demyelinating disease","occurrence of neurodegenerative disease","amino acid exchanges","jubatus mitochondrial genome","homoplasmic conservative amino acid substitution valine","specific valine","nonconservative amino acid change","partial complex","mitochondrial DNA","complete mitochondrial genome of Acinonyx jubatus","codon","MTND5 gene","homoplasmic SNP","human mtDNA-associated diseases","specific coding regions","single nucleotide polymorphisms","methionine substitution","MTND4L gene","nondiseased animals","synonymous SNP","tRNAs leucine UUR","alanine","serine UCN","lysine","control region","SNPs","bp","cause","pedigree information","CR","phenotypic comparability","candidates","subunit","basis","study","levels","high sequence similarity","view","addition","individuals","domestic cat","haplotypes"],"language":"en"},

The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules.

However, analytical methods to support NGS platforms are not as uniformly available. Pathosphere (found at Pathosphere.org) is a cloud - based open - sourced community tool that allows for communication, collaboration and sharing of NGS analytical tools and data amongst scientists working in academia, industry and government. The architecture allows for users to upload data and run available bioinformatics pipelines without the need for onsite processing hardware or technical support. RESULTS: The pathogen detection capabilities hosted on Pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by NGS with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds. Pathosphere analytical pipelines developed by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) identified spiked pathogens within a common sample analyzed by 454, Ion Torrent, and Illumina sequencing platforms. ECBC pipelines also correctly identified pathogens in human samples containing arenavirus in addition to animal samples containing flavivirus and coronavirus. These analytical methods were limited in the detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within NCBI databases, such as parvovirus. Utilizing the pipeline-hosting adaptability of Pathosphere, the analytical suite was supplemented by analytical pipelines designed by the United States Army Medical Research Insititute of Infectious Diseases and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (USAMRIID-WRAIR). These pipelines were implemented and detected parvovirus sequence in the sample that the ECBC iterative analysis previously failed to identify. CONCLUSIONS: By accurately detecting pathogens in a variety of samples, this work demonstrates the utility of Pathosphere and provides a platform for utilizing, modifying and creating pipelines for a variety of NGS technologies developed to detect pathogens in complex sample backgrounds. These results serve as an exhibition for the existing pipelines and web-based interface of Pathosphere as well as the plug-in adaptability that allows for integration of newer NGS analytical software as it becomes available.

In pigs, the newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reported in the US and Asia, as well as the discovery of novel CoVs in wild bats or birds, has necessitated development of improved detection and control measures for these CoVs. Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007\u20132011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (\u03B4-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including \u03B4-CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of \u03B1-, \u03B2-, \u03B3-, and \u03B4-CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the \u03B4-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for \u03B4-CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one \u03B3-CoV and two \u03B4-CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hui; Jung, Kwonil; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda J.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5506b487f28d7d1aac6591855296c424f511a249.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113874.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29499225/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.02.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417304925; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417304925","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["established panCoV RT-PCR assay","new panCoV RT-PCR assay","one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay","designed panCoV RT-PCR assay","PanCoV RT-PCR fragments","conventional RT-PCR","\u03B4-CoVs","animal CoVs","known CoVs","transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays","assay conditions","\u03B3-CoV","avian samples","sequenced samples","animal biological samples","discovery of novel CoVs","serum samples","swine biological samples","\u03B4-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers","PDCoV","known human","PEDV","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","animal pathogens","swine fecal","new primer","specificity","critical human","high sensitivity","re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","emerged porcine deltacoronavirus","development of improved detection","potential","birds","feces","wild bats","severe epidemics of respiratory","intestinal contents","sera","RdRP","control measures","goal","conserved protein domain of \u03B1","enteric diseases","presence","bp-region","Abstract Coronaviruses","previous pancoronavirus","pigs","panel","Phylogenetic analysis","Asia","study","deltacoronaviruses","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response. Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response. We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Chong-Shan; Nabar, Neel R.; Huang, Ning-Na; Kehrl, John H.","journal":"Cell Death Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3319b5fd5749bba0f2fa25f335cc8c19b351a403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6549181.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-019-0181-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aggregated ORF8b","ORF8b triggers cell death consistent","pyroptotic cell death","ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress","caspase-independent cell death","NLRP3 inflammasome","SARS pathology","ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent","intracellular stress pathways","aberrant activation","subsequent activation","SARS-CoV open reading frame","innate immune response","macrophages","Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3","cytosolic dot","epithelial cells","mitochondrial dysfunction","lysosome machinery","autophagy","Transcription factor EB","master regulator","lysosomal damage","endoplasmic reticulum","outbreak","direct cytotoxic effects","severe acute respiratory syndrome","valine","ASC","TFEB","potent signal","structures","residue","coronavirus","mechanisms","ability"],"language":"en"},

The majority of vaccines used contained two influenza A strains and only one influenza B strain (trivalent vaccine). Aim The aim of the study was to compare laboratory confirmed influenza B cases during three consecutive years with respect to vaccination history, clinical symptoms and molecular virology. Methods Partial HA gene sequences were analyzed for lineage determination and complete HA sequence in cases with reported vaccination and in fatal cases. Clinical data were retrieved from patient charts. Findings During the 2015/16 season, 75 influenza B cases were retrieved; 11 in 2016/17, and 274 in 2017/18. The frequency of Yamagata-lineage strains increased from 7.6% to 100%. No difference was detected in the relative frequency of co-morbidities in season 2017/18. 37.7% of the adult patients and 4.5% of pediatric patients were vaccinated against influenza. Interpretation Phylogenetically, Yamagata strains clustered similarly in 2017/2018 when compared to the previous two influenza seasons. While the relative frequency of influenza B cases differed, the clinical symptoms remained similar. Conclusion World Health Organization recommendations for the use of tetravalent vaccines that contain two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) in addition to the two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) should be implemented in national vaccination guidelines.

Initial infection with hMPV usually occurs during early childhood, but re-infections are common throughout life. Due to the slow growth of the virus in cell culture, molecular methods (such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)) are the preferred diagnostic modality for detecting hMPV. A few vaccine candidates have been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease, but none are yet commercially available. Our understanding of hMPV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we will review the currently available information on the molecular biology and epidemiology of hMPV.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yuan; Ning, Zhi; Chen, Yu; Guo, Ming; Liu, Yingle; Gali, Nirmal Kumar; Sun, Li; Duan, Yusen; Cai, Jing; Westerdahl, Dane; Liu, Xinjin; Ho, Kin-fai; Kan, Haidong; Fu, Qingyan; Lan, Ke","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e655c2ad915c4b181014f112510c6a17b08b04bd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2989bf36068372cfedef82f58f4777e60ccbcfaa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","CCU","PUA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["aerosol transmission of SARS","viral SARS-CoV","undetectable airborne SARS-CoV","low airborne SARS-CoV","deposition aerosol","potential source of airborne SARS-CoV","aerosol samples","aerosol RNA concentration","Fangcang patient toilet","virus aerosol deposition","Fangcang MSA","Patient Areas","potential transmission pathway","patient hall","deposition samples","higher concentration","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital","general patient rooms","ICU","Public Areas","PUA","ongoing outbreak of COVID","Medical Staff Areas","RNA genome","disinfection of toilet","effective sanitization","rigorous sanitization","air sample","infected persons","proper use","floor surface","subsequent resuspension","different types","robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction","protective apparel","total suspended particle","open space","ddPCR","contact","human respiratory droplets","size","method","patients number","PAA","bimodal distribution","Room ventilation","asymptomatic carriers","China","crowds","accumulating crowd flow","global concern"],"language":"en"},

In contrast with H5N1 with over 650 confirmed cases over 11 years, H7N9 has infected over 450 persons within 2 years. The case fatality rate for H7N9 (35 %) is lower than for H5N1 (60 %) or H10N8 (67 %) but is comparable to that for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), another emerging zoonosis with travel-associated importations. Exposure to poultry and fomites are considered the likely sources of infection for H7N9, H5N1, and H10N8, with limited human-to-human transmission in close contacts. Most cases have occurred in local populations of affected countries, and travel-related risk can be mitigated by avoiding exposure. Vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics remain in development stage or of modest benefit for dangerous infections carrying high morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazarus, Rajeka; Lim, Poh Lian","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3107bd7faeff9042d603761f6ae66e457160432.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088727.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-014-0456-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia","China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["H5N1 influenza","years","emergence of H7N9","H10N8","Exposure","human transmission","limited human","confirmed cases","travel-associated importations","travel-related risk","new avian influenza threat","MERS CoV","modest benefit","dangerous infections","raised concerns","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","emerging zoonosis","high morbidity","local populations of affected countries","likely sources of infection","development stage","Southeast Asia","therapeutics","mortality","fomites","China","poultry","close contacts","case fatality rate","Vaccines","antivirals","contrast","persons"],"language":"en"},

Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the risk of infection within and beyond the 2-row rule given by public health guidance. Methods We searched the literature for reports of in-flight transmission of infection which included seat maps indicating where the infectious and infected passengers were seated. Findings There is a \u223C 6% risk to passengers seated within the 2-rows of infected individual(s) and there is \u223C 2% risk to passengers seated beyond 2-rows from the infectious individual. Discussion Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2-rows of the infectious individual(s) could fail to detect other cases of infections. This has important consequences for assessing the spread of infectious diseases. Conclusions Infection at a distance from the index case indicates other factors, such as airflow, movement of passenger/crew members, fomites and contacts between passengers in the departure gate before boarding, or after deplaning, are involved.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hertzberg, Vicki Stover; Weiss, Howard","journal":"Annals of Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/295aba564f8a31e7ead091ef523f19d797d24b74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104167.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999616307421; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999616307421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283135/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2016.06.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious individual","in-flight transmission of infectious diseases","infectious passenger","infected passengers","respiratory infectious diseases","spread of infectious diseases","airline passengers","risk of infection","primary transmission risk","instances of in-flight transmission","reports of in-flight transmission of infection","rows of infected individual","factors","public health guidance","public health agencies","Conclusions Infection","important global health concern","movement of passenger","Long-standing guidance","important consequences","air travel","crew members","contacts","fomites","seat maps","departure gate","distance","boarding","airflow","row rule","literature","index case","study","Discussion Contact tracing","Abstract Background","Objective","aim","deplaning","Methods","relative influence","effect of proximity","cases of infections","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this surveillance study was to apply a non-invasive approach using fresh feces to detect viruses circulating within the diverse species of Kenyan bats. We screened for both DNA and RNA viruses; specifically, astroviruses (AstVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), caliciviruses (CalVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), flaviviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), polyomaviruses (PYVs) and rotaviruses. We used family-specific primers, amplicon sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis. Except for filoviruses, eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and positive rates across the five regions (former provinces) studied. AstVs (12.83%), CoVs (3.97%), PMV (2.4%), ADV (2.26%), PYV (1.65%), CalVs (0.29%), rotavirus (0.19%) and flavivirus (0.19%). Novel CalVs were detected in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus while novel Rotavirus-A-related viruses were detected in Taphozous bats and R. aegyptiacus. The two Rotavirus A (RVA) strains detected were highly related to human strains with VP6 genotypes I2 and I16. Genotype I16 has previously been assigned to human RVA-strain B10 from Kenya only, which raises public health concern, particularly considering increased human-bat interaction. Additionally, 229E-like bat CoVs were detected in samples originating from Hipposideros bats roosting in sites with high human activity. Our findings confirm the presence of diverse viruses in Kenyan bats while providing extended knowledge on bat virus distribution. The detection of viruses highly related to human strains and hence of public health concern, underscores the importance of continuous surveillance.

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF \u002B prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF \u002B PF \u002B PPC. The study\u2019s primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study\u2019s primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF \u002B PF \u002B PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. DISCUSSION: Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive.

Emerging evidence suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a major subgroup of the IFN target genes, and further, that the IFN response is subject to regulation by a large number of host- and pathogen-derived lncRNAs. While the vast majority of lncRNAs with potential roles in the IFN response remain unstudied, analysis of a very small subset provides a glimpse of the regulatory impact of this class of RNAs on IFN response.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valadkhan, Saba; Gunawardane, Lalith S.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ea76cd58f2e35e867b52721d5e22163f2973737.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f37c46921622126356850dcf3b0fb221b288abd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4744491.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4744491?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215300794; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215300794; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.09.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26474526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN response","IFN genes","IFN target genes","innate immune response","vast majority of lncRNAs","pathogen-derived lncRNAs","major host defense mechanism","major subgroup","class of RNAs","large number of host","long non-coding RNAs","potential roles","regulation","critical arm","viral infections","analysis","cellular transcriptome","Emerging evidence","regulatory impact","expression of hundreds","transcriptional activation","series","glimpse","events","significant changes","small subset","turn","microbial encounter","interferon"],"language":"en"},

The starting point is the TAM\u2013WG model, combining the Taxon Affordance Model and the World Graph model of spatial navigation. The key here is to reject approaches in which memory is restricted to unanalyzed views from familiar places, and their later recall. Instead, we will seek mechanisms for imagining truly novel scenes and episodes. We thus introduce a specific variant of schema theory and VISIONS, a cooperative computation model of visual scene understanding in which a scene is represented by an assemblage of schema instances with links to lower-level \u201Cpatches\u201D of relevant visual data. We sketch a new conceptual framework for future modeling, Visual Integration of Diverse Multi-Modal Aspects, by extending VISIONS from static scenes to episodes combining agents, actions and objects and assess its relevance to both navigation and episodic memory. We can then analyze imagination as a constructive process that combines aspects of memories of prior episodes along with other schemas and adjusts them into a coherent whole which, through expectations associated with diverse episodes and schemas, may yield the linkage of episodes that constitutes a dream or a narrative. The result is IBSEN, a conceptual model of Imagination in Brain Systems for Episodes and Navigation. The essay closes by analyzing other papers in this Special Issue to assess to what extent their results relate to the research proposed here.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arbib, Michael A.","journal":"Biol Cybern","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34e78e556e161cde23d9e30c5335e8f553d84dd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152744.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00422-020-00829-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse episodes","prior episodes","linkage of episodes","conceptual model of Imagination","WG model","spatial navigation models","models of visual construction","cooperative computation model of visual scene","World Graph model of spatial navigation","episodic memory","Taxon Affordance Model","VISIONS","Visual Integration of Diverse Multi-Modal Aspects","relevant visual data","schemas","aspects of memories","personal essay","static scenes","novel scenes","essay closes","new conceptual framework","assemblage of schema instances","specific variant of schema theory","future modeling","links","patches","Brain Systems","lower-level","familiar places","actions","agents","relevance","extent","papers","unanalyzed views","TAM","objects","constructive process","expectations","IBSEN","starting point","hybrid of review","Special Issue","later recall","dream","results","research","mechanisms","approaches","key","narrative"],"language":"en"},

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Serial chest radiographies (CXRs) were obtained from viral exposure until death or discharge in 35 patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Radiographic scores were calculated by multiplying a four-point scale of involved lung area and three-point scale of abnormal opacification, in each of the six lung zones. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to identify optimal day and radiographic score for the prediction of respiratory distress, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess significant predictive factors for intubation or tracheostomy. Among 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; median age: 48 years), 25 demonstrated abnormal opacity on CXR (MERS pneumonia), whereas no abnormality was detected in 10 patients (MERS upper respiratory tract infection). Seven patients required ventilator support (intubation group) and three of them eventually expired. The average incubation period was 5.4 days (standard deviation, \u00B12.8; range, 2\u201311). Patients in the intubation group had a higher incidence of diffuse lung involvement, higher radiographic scores, and fibrosing sequela on follow up study compared with those in the non-intubation group. However, patients\u2019 age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.726 for the radiographic score on day 10 with an optimal cutoff score of 10 for prediction of intubation, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 67%.

METHODS: This is a single center, observational cohort study. Data of all patients tested positive with COVID-19 and presented with ALI vascular diseases requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database. For this series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (\u003C30 days) re-occlusion, or major amputation or death \u226424 hours. Primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (\u226430 days) and late survival (\u226530 days), postoperative (\u2264 30 days) complications, and limb salvage. RESULTS: We evaluated 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19. Considering the period January-to-March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly higher than 2019 [23/141 (16.3%) vs. 3/163 (1.8%), P \u003C 0.001)]. There were 18 (90%) male and 2 female patients. Mean age was 75 years \u00B1 9 (range, 62-95). All patients had already been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Operative treatment was performed in 17 (85%) patients. Revascularization was successful in 12/17 (70.6%) patients. Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.622), no patients receiving intravenous heparin required reintervention. There were 8 (40%) in-hospital mortalities. Age was significantly higher in those who died (years, 81 \u00B1 10 vs. 71 \u00B1 5, P = 0.008). The use of continued postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardia region. Successful revascularization was lower than expected which we hypothesize is due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state. The use of prolonged systemic heparin may improve surgical treatment efficacy as well as improve limb salvage and overall mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellosta, Raffaello; Luzzani, Luca; Natalini, Giuseppe; Pegorer, Matteo Alberto; Attisani, Luca; Cossu, Luisa Giuseppina; Ferrandina, Camillo; Fossati, Alessandro; Conti, Elena; Bush, Ruth L.; Piffaretti, Gabriele","journal":"J Vasc Surg","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188654.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420310806; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420310806?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["female patients","COVID","successful revascularization","incidence rate of patients","clinical outcomes of patients","incidence of ALI","days","postoperative use of intravenous heparin","use of prolonged systemic heparin","limb salvage","ALI vascular diseases","use of continued postoperative systemic heparin infusion","urgent operative treatment","coronavirus pandemic","years","surgical treatment efficacy","acute limb ischemia","novel coronavirus","Primary outcomes","late survival","absence of early","Mean age","observational cohort study","treated arterial segment","major amputation","single center","re-occlusion","death","preliminary experience","infection","complications","Italian Lombardia region","hours","characteristics","overall mortality","series","reintervention","virus-related hypercoagulable state","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","aim","hospital mortalities","range","pneumonia","RESULTS","database","period"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, relatively little is known concerning the interplay between HIV-1 and microglia. Recent findings suggest that, counter-intuitively, HIV-1 infection may extend the lifespan of microglia. We developed a novel cell line model system to confirm and mechanistically study this phenomenon. We found that transduction of a human microglial cell line with an HIV-1 vector results in a powerful cytoprotective effect following apoptotic challenge. This effect was reproduced by ectopic expression of a single virus-encoded protein, Tat. Subsequent studies showed that the pro-survival effects of intracellular Tat could be attributed to activation of the PI-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the microglial cell line. Furthermore, we found that expression of Tat led to decreased expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI-3-K pathway. Consistent with this, decreased p53 activity and increased E2F activity were observed. Based on these findings, a model of possible regulatory circuits that intracellular Tat and HIV-1 infection engage during the cytoprotective event in microglia has been suggested. We propose that the expression of Tat may enable HIV-1 infected microglia to survive throughout the course of infection, leading to persistent HIV-1 production and infection in the central nervous system.","publish_time":"2007-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chugh, Pauline; Fan, Shongshan; Planelles, Vicente; Maggirwar, Sanjay B.; Dewhurst, Stephen; Kim, Baek","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/973b709be1f105a101100621ae88d48176de58d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127718.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606015403; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606015403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tat"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Tat","persistent HIV","human microglial cell line","course of infection","ectopic expression","infected microglia","lifespan of microglia","decreased expression of PTEN","novel cell line model system","pro-survival effects of intracellular Tat","decreased p53 activity","powerful cytoprotective effect","Akt pathway","cytoprotective event","vector results","Recent findings","interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type","increased E2F activity","central nervous system","model of possible regulatory circuits","single virus-encoded protein","production","negative regulator","kinase","PI3K","apoptotic challenge","transduction","Subsequent studies","CD4","counter","activation","T lymphocytes","interplay","induced cytolysis","contrast","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of eMAG\u2122 and easyMAG(\u00AE) on various clinical specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory (n = 199), whole blood (n = 50), plasma (n = 25) and urine (n = 25) specimens were extracted in parallel on both platforms. Both qualitative (respiratory virus, cell control, CMV, EBV, HHV6 and BKV detection) and quantitative (respiratory virus and cell control cycle thresolds, and CMV, EBV, HHV6 and BKV viral loads) results were compared. RESULTS: Detection of qualitative targets showed good agreement, ranging from 84.6% for whole blood to 95.9% for respiratory specimens.

Early in tumorigenesis, the pathway exerts anti\u2010tumor effects through suppressing cell cycle and inducing apoptosis, while during late stages, it functions as a tumor promoter by enhancing tumor invasiveness and metastasis. This signaling pathway can be perturbed by environmental and genetic factors such as microbial interference and mutation, respectively. In this way, the present review describes the modulation of the TGF\u2010\u03B2 pathway by oncogenic human viral pathogens and other viruses. The main mechanisms by which viruses interferes with TGF\u2010\u03B2 signaling seems to be through (1) the alteration of either TGF\u2010\u03B2 protein expression or activation, (2) the modulation of the TGF\u2010\u03B2 receptors or SMADs factors (by interfering with their levels and functions), (3) the alteration of none\u2010SMAD pathways, and (4) indirect interaction with the pathway by the modulation of transcriptional co\u2010activator/repressor and regulators of the pathway. Given the axial role of this pathway in tumorigenesis, it can be regarded as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Hence, further investigations on this subject may represent molecular targets among either TGF\u2010\u03B2 signaling molecules or viral factors for the treatment and management of viral infection consequences such as cancer.","publish_time":"2018-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mirzaei, Habibollah; Faghihloo, Ebrahim","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3120ea8763d50603309035c1d5843f15a6130de5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29345394/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2 pathway","TGF","\u03B2 receptors","viral factors","\u03B2 protein expression","apoptosis","genetic factors","tumor promoter","tumor invasiveness","SMADs factors","viruses","cancer therapy","tumorigenesis","alteration","functions","anti\u2010tumor effects","oncogenic human viral pathogens","management of viral infection consequences","modulation of transcriptional co\u2010activator","suppressing cell cycle","diseases","treatment","particular organ fibrosis","differentiation","repressor","normal development","proliferation","vascular disorders","regulators","activation","molecules","double\u2010edged sword","mesenchymal transition","vital processes","microbial interference","molecular targets","migration","key network","present review","growth factor","subject","attractive target","metastasis","mutation","indirect interaction","axial role","SMAD pathways","late stages","main mechanisms","investigations","levels"],"language":"en"},

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the duration of cough and sputum production by approximately one-half day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, \u22120.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, \u22120.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, \u22120.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.","publish_time":"1999-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bent, Stephen; Saint, Sanjay; Vittinghoff, Eric; Grady, Deborah","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0c8280395b9ac6b028ef64dd7a64ee05213bcae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124195.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934399001679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934399001679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of antibiotics","antibiotics erythromycin","effectiveness of antibiotics","treatment of acute bronchitis","diagnosis of acute bronchitis","randomized trials","healthy patients","decrease","randomized controlled trials","treatment group","days of cough","meta-analysis of randomized","trimethoprim","doxycycline","sulfamethoxazole","days of purulent sputum","small benefit","summary effect size","sputum production","control group","duration of cough","antibiotic resistance","English-language studies","one-half day","sufficient data","nonsignificant trends","societal cost","medical care","METHODS","placebo","inclusion criteria","Abstract PURPOSE","bibliographies","consultation","SUBJECTS","effects","specific symptoms","risk","work","MEDLINE","experts","intervention","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here we demonstrated that porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is a major causative agent of an emerging and important swine disease complex, PCV2-associated diseases, caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through degradation of cyclin D1 and E followed by reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation in synchronized PCV2-infected cells dependent upon virus replication. This induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest promoted PCV2 replication as evidenced by increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in the synchronized PCV2-infected cells. To delineate a mechanism of miRNAs in regulating PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we determined expression levels of some relevant miRNAs and found that only miR-15a but not miR-16, miR-21, and miR-34a was significantly changed in the PCV2-infected cells. We further demonstrated that upregulation of miR-15a promoted PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via mediating cyclins D1 and E degradation, in which involves PCV2 growth. These results reveal that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favourable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production and that miR-15a is implicated in PCV2-induced cell cycle control, thereby contributing to efficient viral replication.","publish_time":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quan, Rong; Wei, Li; Zhu, Shanshan; Wang, Jing; Cao, Yongchang; Xue, Chunyi; Yan, Xu; Liu, Jue","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bdae8c38f570965cc9a630a44b7089c2a5da0ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4908419.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302568/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 replication","PCV2 growth","G1 cell cycle arrest","PCV2-induced cell cycle control","promoted PCV2-induced G0","PCV2-associated diseases","host cell division cycle","synchronized PCV2-infected cells dependent","upregulation of miR","induction of G0","viral protein expression","virus replication","efficient viral replication","progeny production","E degradation","progeny virus production","expression levels","degradation of cyclin D1","relevant miRNAs","mechanism of miRNAs","mediating cyclins D1","important swine disease complex","reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation","favourable conditions","major causative agent","viruses","porcine circovirus type","results"],"language":"en"},

While pathogen evolution, co-infection, and behavioural changes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks, the effect of public health interventions remains undetermined. METHODS: We develop mean-field and stochastic epidemiological models for disease transmission, and perform simulations to show how control measures, such as drug treatment and isolation of ill individuals, can influence the epidemic profile and generate sequences of infection waves with different characteristics. RESULTS: We demonstrate the impact of parameters representing the effectiveness and adverse consequences of intervention measures, such as treatment and emergence of drug resistance, on the spread of a pathogen in the population. If pathogen resistant strains evolve under drug pressure, multiple outbreaks are possible with variability in their characteristics, magnitude, and timing. In this context, the level of drug use and isolation capacity play an important role in the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks. Our simulations for influenza infection as a case study indicate that the intensive use of these interventions during the early stages of the epidemic could delay the spread of disease, but it may also result in later infection waves with possibly larger magnitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of intervention parameters in the process of public health decision-making, and in evaluating control measures when facing substantial uncertainty regarding the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging infectious pathogen. Critical factors that influence population health including evolutionary responses of the pathogen under the pressure of different intervention measures during an epidemic should be considered for the design of effective strategies that address short-term targets compatible with long-term disease outcomes.","publish_time":"2011-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wessel, Lindsay; Hua, Yi; Wu, Jianhong; Moghadas, Seyed M","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ed0914312a47f0d8c127bc1db47446c1792e1de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3317576.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-s1-s2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21356131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","multiple infection waves","drug pressure","drug treatment","sequences of infection waves","co-infection","later infection waves","control measures","pathogen evolution","pressure of different intervention measures","epidemiological characteristics","multiple outbreaks","population health","different characteristics","spread of disease","level of drug use","occurrence of subsequent outbreaks","pathogen resistant strains","emerging infectious pathogen","adverse consequences of intervention measures","effect of public health interventions","importance of intervention parameters","emergence of drug resistance","disease transmission","epidemic profile","simulations","process of public health decision-making","long-term disease outcomes","isolation capacity","possible mechanisms","intensive use","impact of parameters","stochastic epidemiological models","isolation of ill individuals","past influenza pandemics","short-term targets compatible","important role","effectiveness","mean-field","case study","behavioural changes","variability","evolutionary responses","substantial uncertainty","design of effective strategies","findings","larger magnitudes","BACKGROUND","Epidemics","Critical factors","early stages","human diseases","context","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","timing","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

For the last-named application, gold nanoparticles should be properly fabricated to deliver the cargo into the targeted cells through effective endocytosis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding the selective penetration of gold nanoparticles into immune cells. The interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cell receptors is discussed. As distinct from other published reviews, we present a summary of the immunological properties of gold nanoparticles. This review also summarizes what is known about the application of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant in immunization for the preparation of antibodies in vivo. For each of the above topics, the basic principles, recent advances, and current challenges are discussed. Thus, this review presents a detailed analysis of data on interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells. Emphasis is placed on the systematization of data over production of antibodies by using gold nanoparticles and adjuvant properties of gold nanoparticles. Specifically, we start our discussion with current data on interaction of various gold nanoparticles with immune cells. The next section describes existing technologies to improve production of antibodies in vivo by using gold nanoparticles conjugated with specific ligands. Finally, we describe what is known about adjuvant properties of bare gold or functionalized nanoparticles.

Methods: Consecutive major trauma patients were prospectively enrolled in 2 phases, the first before and the second after the implementation of a paramedic RSI program. Paramedics with experience in this mixed suburban and rural emergency medical services (EMS) system were eligible for RSI training. RSI training consisted of 6 hours of didactic and mannequin training. Operating room intubation experience is required for oral intubation clearance in the system but is not used for RSI training. All trauma patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 3 and 8 and for whom resuscitation was indicated were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included death in the field or ED and inability to obtain outcome information. For both phases, intubation was indicated for trauma patients with a GCS score of 3 to 8. For phase 2, oral intubation was attempted for all patients before RSI. Etomidate and succinylcholine were administered for RSI. RSI was not attempted for patients for whom the alternative airways, esophageal-tracheal twin-lumen airway device (Combitube), cricothyrotomy, or bag-valve-mask ventilation was judged not feasible. The Combitube was used as the primary salvage airway device. Method of airway control, intubation success rates, and survival to hospital discharge were determined. Results: There were 134 patients with outcomes in phase 1: 19 of 21 (90.5%) in arrest at presentation had a definitive airway established, and 19 had additional exclusion criteria, leaving 94 for analysis. There were 386 patients with outcomes in phase 2: 85 of 94 (90.4%) in arrest at presentation had a definitive airway established, and 65 had additional exclusion criteria, leaving 227 for analysis. The oral intubation success rate was improved for phase 2 study versus phase 1 control patients (53.3% versus 14.9%); total definitive airway rate was also greater (59.5% versus 40.4%). RSI was used in 112 patients; 11 were excluded. Oral intubation success for RSI patients was 87.5%; 91.1% had definitive airways established. Survival for patients with oral intubation without RSI was similar for both phases (42.4% versus 42.9%). Survival for study patients was improved during phase 2 (78.0% versus 67.3%). Survival for study RSI patients was 85.1%. Conclusion: EMS protocols for paramedic RSI resulted in improved intubation success rates and improved survival to hospital discharge.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domeier, R.

The objectives of the current study were to detect genetically distinct genotypes and eventually recombinant genotypes in samples collected in Lower Normandy between 2001 and 2013. To this end, we sequenced complete nsp12, S, and N genes of 15 molecular isolates of HCoV-OC43 from clinical samples and compared them to available data from the USA, Belgium, and Hong-Kong. A new cluster E was invariably detected from nsp12, S, and N data while the analysis of nsp12 and N genes revealed the existence of new F and G clusters respectively. The association of these different clusters of genes in our specimens led to the description of thirteen genetically distinct genotypes, among which eight recombinant viruses were discovered. Identification of these recombinant viruses, together with temporal analysis and tMRCA estimation, provides important information for understanding the dynamics of the evolution of these epidemic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2015-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kin, Nathalie; Miszczak, Fabien; Lin, Wei; Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg; Vabret, Astrid","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/616eb9a60a8da572b0a60b6d33f4618c91c7b55c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4452910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7052358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26008694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N genes","recombinant genotypes","analysis of nsp12","N data","HCoV-OC43","distinct genotypes","recombinant viruses","complete nsp12","different clusters of genes","Human coronavirus OC43","human coronaviruses responsible","epidemic coronaviruses","temporal analysis","clinical samples","available data","G clusters","molecular isolates of HCoV","existence of new F","new cluster E","Belgium","tMRCA estimation","important information","dynamics","USA","respiratory infections","specimens","current study","Lower Normandy","evolution","association","description","Hong-Kong","genome\u2019s high plasticity","objectives","end","Identification"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis, network tree, similarity plot analysis, Recombination Detection Program 4(RDP4) and sequence comparison revealed that 12 of the 20 isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. One isolate, ck/CH/LSD/110857, was shown to have originated from recombination events between H120- and 4/91-like vaccine strains that did not result in changes of antigenicity and pathogenicity. The remaining seven IBV isolates were shown to have originated from recombination events between a 4/91-like vaccine strain and a GX-LY9-like virus, which were responsible for the emergence of a novel serotype. A vaccination-challenge test found that vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine strain did not provide protection against challenge with the recombinant viruses. In addition, the results showed that the recombination events between the vaccine and field strains resulted in altered genetics, serotype, antigenicity, and pathogenicity compared with those of their deduced parental viruses. The results are important not only because this virus is of economic importance to poultry industry, but also because it is important for elucidating the origin and evolution of other coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Zongxi; Zhao, Wenjun; Chen, Yuqiu; Xu, Qianqian; Sun, Junfeng; Zhang, Tingting; Zhao, Yan; Liang, Shuling; Gao, Mengying; Wang, Qiuling; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a18d1ecb921ed3e98c0d90d922d4b88fbc36b6f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117474.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.01.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517301438; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517301438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombination Detection Program","IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["vaccine strains","recombination events","reisolated vaccine virus","Phylogenetic analysis","Recombination Detection Program","field strains","infectious bronchitis virus","sequence comparison","IBV isolates","pathogenicity","results","complete genomic sequence analysis","similarity plot analysis","vaccination-challenge test","novel serotype","changes of antigenicity","recombinant viruses","S1 gene comparison","deduced parental viruses","network tree","altered genetics","RDP4","protection","economic importance","study","GX-LY9","poultry industry","ck","LSD","origin","evolution","emergence","H120","coronaviruses","Abstract","addition","China"],"language":"en"},

Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages. Our results may provide new insights into the control of cytokine dysregulation.","publish_time":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, Anna H. Y.; Tam, Alex H. M.; Lee, Davy C. W.; Lau, Allan S.

METHODS: Data were collected at two time points in the winter in Hong Kong, during which influenza is most prevalent. At Time 1, older adults (N = 141) completed self-report measures of SDT (perceived autonomy support from senior center staff, autonomous motivation for influenza prevention) and TPB (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention for influenza prevention) constructs with respect to facemask used to prevent infection. Two weeks later, at Time 2, participants\u2019 acceptance of a facemask to prevent influenza in the presence of an experimenter with flu-like symptoms was recorded. RESULTS: Path analysis found that perceived autonomy support of senior center staff was positively and significantly linked to autonomous motivation for facemask use, which, in turn, was positively related to intentions to wear facemasks through the mediation of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. However, the effect of intention on facemask use was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results generally support the proposed framework and the findings of previous studies with respect to intention, but the non-significant intention-behavior relationship may warrant future research to examine the reasons for older adults not to wear facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza despite having positive intentions to do so.","publish_time":"2017-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, Pak-Kwong; Zhang, Chun-Qing; Liu, Jing-Dong; Chan, Derwin King-Chung; Si, Gangyan; Hagger, Martin S.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5534058.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4608-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Time","TPB"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["influenza prevention","seasonal influenza","facemask use","use of facemasks","perceived behavioral control","perceived autonomy support of senior center staff","effect of intention","Hong Kong older adults","subjective norm","respect","non-significant intention-behavior relationship","TPB","autonomous motivation","time points","RESULTS","theory of planned behavior","mediation of attitude","theoretical framework","proposed framework","self-determination theory","positive intentions","self-report measures of SDT","findings of previous studies","future research","Path analysis","constructs","effectiveness","experimenter","reasons","winter","presence","participants\u2019 acceptance","study","Data","turn","BACKGROUND","symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","infection","METHODS","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants for use with recombinant S protein: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization; and Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) agonists, which have previously been shown to be an effective adjuvant in an ultraviolet\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV vaccine. All the mice immunized with more than 0.5 \u00B5g S protein without adjuvant escaped from SARS after infection with mouse\u2010adapted SARS\u2010CoV; however, eosinophilic infiltrations were observed in the lungs of almost all the immunized mice. The AuNP\u2010adjuvanted protein induced a strong IgG response but failed to improve vaccine efficacy or to reduce eosinophilic infiltration because of highly allergic inflammatory responses. Whereas similar virus titers were observed in the control animals and the animals immunized with S protein with or without AuNPs, Type 1 interferon and pro\u2010inflammatory responses were moderate in the mice treated with S protein with and without AuNPs. On the other hand, the TLR agonist\u2010adjuvanted vaccine induced highly protective antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations, as well as Th1/17 cytokine responses.

Methods: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. Results: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. 3 of them were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days.

This study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 2 such technologies, PCR\u2013electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS, with respect to phenotypic and biochemical profiling as a reference standard method. A positive challenge set of blood culture bottles was used to compare PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS performance on a matched set of samples. METHODS: We performed characterization of bloodstream infections from blood cultures using the Ibis T5000 PCR-ESI/MS and the Bruker MALDI Biotyper 2.0 (MALDI-TOF/MS) platforms for microbial identification. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by independent comparison of each method to phenotypic and biochemical characterization with Vitek2 analysis as the reference standard identification. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy, represented as positive agreement, at the genus level was 0.965 (0.930\u20130.984) for PCR-ESI/MS and 0.969 (0.935\u20130.987) for MALDI-TOF/MS, and at the species level was 0.952 (0.912\u20130.974) with PCR-ESI/MS and 0.943 (0.902\u20130.968) for MALDI-TOF/MS. No statistically significant difference was found between PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS in the ability to rapidly identify microorganisms isolated from blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS are equivalent in their ability to characterize bloodstream infections with respect to the reference standard, and highlight key differences in the methods that allow for each method to have a unique niche as a tool for rapid identification of microbes in blood cultures.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaleta, Erin J; Clark, Andrew E; Cherkaoui, Abdessalam; Wysocki, Vicki H; Ingram, Elizabeth L; Schrenzel, Jacques; Wolk, Donna M","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/323b11bfca3d12e39a43db47694d155218f2b00f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108470.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2011.161968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS performance","MALDI-TOF","Ibis T5000 PCR-ESI","reference standard identification","Bruker MALDI Biotyper","microbial identification","blood cultures","reference standard method","methods","diagnostic accuracy","rapid identification of microbes","biochemical characterization","blood culture bottles","biochemical profiling","characterization of bloodstream infections","respect","ability","RESULTS","Vitek2 analysis","semiquantitative analysis of microbial proteins","Emerging technologies","positive agreement","positive challenge","genus level","species level","matched set of samples","molecular testing algorithms","shift","mass spectrometry","tool","independent comparison","electrospray ionization","platforms","genetic elements","unique niche","BACKGROUND","key differences","significant difference","microorganisms","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

Accordingly, bio-logic suggests that new genome structures will emerge among the lentiviruses, most notably HIV-1.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wain-Hobson, Simon","journal":"Origin and Evolution of Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78208703f7f2c5eb00102d2db1a51792930c6622.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149677.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741530000138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123741530000138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new genome structures","rich ensemble of genome structures","emergence of novel genome structures","ABSTRACT Retroviruses","fixation rates","evolution of retroviruses","fixation of point mutations","bio-logic","lentiviruses","lentivirus subgroup","scene","HIV","fold"],"language":"en"},

Bioterrorism remains a real threat, but because actual incidents remain at a low level, complacency is a constant enemy; hence the continuing background of false alarms may indeed be beneficial, encouraging responding agencies to keep practiced and alert.

The Australian microbial forensic capability is reliant on the combined and coordinated efforts of numerous government facilities, departments, and agencies within law enforcement and public health at the state, territory, and commonwealth levels, as well as the private sector. It is a shining example of how a coordinated effort can provide a comprehensive capability that does well to protect the Australian community. The AFP and Australian Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Data Center also work closely with international law enforcement partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.

Most of the viral and bacterial infections that traditionally affected children have been drastically reduced thanks to national immunization programs in developed countries.

Such challenges include crowded dormitories, shared lavatories, limited medical and isolation resources, daily entry and exit of staff members and visitors, continual introduction of newly incarcerated or detained persons, and transport of incarcerated or detained persons in multiperson vehicles for court-related, medical, or security reasons (2,3). During April 22-28, 2020, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases were reported to CDC by 37 of 54 state and territorial health department jurisdictions. Thirty-two (86%) jurisdictions reported at least one laboratory-confirmed case from a total of 420 correctional and detention facilities. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,893 incarcerated or detained persons and 2,778 facility staff members, resulting in 88 deaths in incarcerated or detained persons and 15 deaths among staff members. Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures, such as symptom screening and quarantine, are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons and staff members.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallace, Megan; Hagan, Liesl; Curran, Kathryn G; Williams, Samantha P; Handanagic, Senad; Bjork, Adam; Davidson, Sherri L; Lawrence, Robert T; McLaughlin, Joseph; Butterfield, Marilee; James, Allison E; Patil, Naveen; Lucas, Kimberley; Hutchinson, Justine; Sosa, Lynn; Jara, Amanda; Griffin, Phillip; Simonson, Sean; Brown, Catherine M; Smoyer, Stephanie; Weinberg, Meghan; Pattee, Brittany; Howell, Molly; Donahue, Matthew; Hesham, Soliman; Shelley, Ellen; Philips, Grace; Selvage, David; Staley, E Michele; Lee, Anthony; Mannell, Mike; McCotter, Orion; Villalobos, Raul; Bell, Linda; Diedhiou, Abdoulaye; Ortbahn, Dustin; Clayton, Joshua L; Sanders, Kelsey; Cranford, Hannah; Barbeau, Bree; McCombs, Katherine G; Holsinger, Caroline; Kwit, Natalie A; Pringle, Julia C; Kariko, Sara; Strick, Lara; Allord, Matt; Tillman, Courtney; Morrison, Andrea; Rowe, Devin; Marlow, Mariel","journal":"MMWR.

METHODS: Cats ranged from 3.4\u201373 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. RESULTS: Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2\u20135 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3\u201384 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GS-441524 was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for FIP. The optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Niels C; Perron, Michel; Bannasch, Michael; Montgomery, Elizabeth; Murakami, Eisuke; Liepnieks, Molly; Liu, Hongwei","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7037460cc980744603573744bf370ee8f49a4ffe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6435921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755068/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x19825701","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["remaining cats","cats re-","relapsing cats","neurological disease","higher dosage","severe disease","disease relapses","optimum dosage","non-effusive disease","effusive FIP","time of publication","SC q24h","original lower dosage","weeks","days","unrelated heart disease","ocular FIP","effective treatment","round of treatment","nucleoside analog GS","months of age","feline infectious peritonitis","various forms","safety","efficacy","study","long-time survivors","OBJECTIVES","aim","CONCLUSIONS","RELEVANCE","OnlineFirst","group","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Methods We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People\u0027s Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Findings Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589\u00B75, 49\u00B73, and 37\u00B75 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2\u00B72 million. Interpretation Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Huai-liang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J.P.; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-Kit","journal":"EClinicalMedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/019d4817c1bb20299f7bcd20248bd85ad0f59a2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292898/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537020300730; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020300730; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission","Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["facemask policy","facemask supply","different universal facemask","severe facemask shortage","global facemask shortage","country-wide universal facemask","domestic facemask supplies","major facemask producer","policy scenarios","policy implementation","largest daily facemask shortages","policy review","N95 mask shortage","regions of mainland China","facemasks","mathematical modelling shortage analyses","effective public communication","People\u0027s Republic of China","Disease Control","novel coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","effective measure","epicentre","COVID","affected regions","high-risk regions","healthcare workers","Public health measures","prediction period","novel infectious disease outbreaks","proper hand hygiene","effectiveness of outbreak control","severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus","global production","National Health Commission","risk of asymptomatic transmission","government websites","data","GAC","Ministry of Industry","NHC","MIIT","CDC","Prevention","priority","Information Technology","General Administration of Customs","Abstract Background","enormous burden","social concern","infection","governments","Hubei province","worldwide demand","societal panic","increased demands","Findings","Interpretation","Methods","respect","duration","pandemic","days"],"language":"en"},

We applied a precision public health strategy to syndromic surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Uganda by combining spatiotemporal analytics with genomic sequencing to detect and characterize viral respiratory pathogens with epidemic potential. METHODS: Using a national surveillance network we identified patients with unexplained, influenza-negative SARI from 2010 to 2015. Spatiotemporal analyses were performed retrospectively to identify clusters of unexplained SARI. Within clusters, respiratory viruses were detected and characterized in naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples using a novel oligonucleotide probe capture (VirCapSeq-VERT) and high-throughput sequencing platform. Linkage to conventional epidemiologic strategies further characterized transmission dynamics of identified pathogens. RESULTS: Among 2901 unexplained SARI cases, 9 clusters were detected, accounting for 301 (10.4%) cases. Clusters were more likely to occur in urban areas and during biannual rainy seasons. Within detected clusters, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of measles-associated SARI; sequence analysis implicated cocirculation of endemic genotype B3 and genotype D4 likely imported from England. We also detected a likely nosocomial SARI cluster associated with a novel picobirnavirus most closely related to swine and dromedary viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Using a precision approach to public health surveillance, we detected and characterized the genomics of vaccine-preventable and zoonotic respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in Uganda. Future studies are needed to assess the feasibility, scalability, and impact of applying similar approaches during real-time public health surveillance in low-income settings.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, Matthew J; Tokarz, Rafal; Bakamutumaho, Barnabas; Kayiwa, John; Byaruhanga, Timothy; Owor, Nicholas; Namagambo, Barbara; Wolf, Allison; Mathema, Barun; Lutwama, Julius J; Schluger, Neil W; Lipkin, W Ian; O\u2019Donnell, Max R","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d259dce085930f831390ee1f66b1b33504611b2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6424078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30099510/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy656","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Uganda","England"],"keyphrases":["detected clusters","clusters of unexplained SARI","associated SARI","unexplained SARI cases","clusters of severe respiratory infections","real-time public health surveillance","precision public health strategy","zoonotic respiratory viruses","likely nosocomial SARI cluster","viral respiratory pathogens","influenza-negative SARI","syndromic surveillance","severe acute respiratory infection","novel set of methods","national surveillance network","novel picobirnavirus","Uganda","precision approach","dromedary viruses","transmission dynamics of identified pathogens","novel oligonucleotide probe capture","genotype D4","genomic sequencing","spatiotemporal analytics","Spatiotemporal analyses","high-throughput sequencing platform","sequence analysis implicated cocirculation of endemic genotype B3","disease prevention","VirCapSeq-VERT","similar approaches","oropharyngeal swab samples","patients","mitigation interventions","unrecognized outbreak of measles","conventional epidemiologic strategies","impact","urban areas","low-income settings","high-risk subpopulations","biannual rainy seasons","naso","genomics of vaccine","swine","epidemic potential","feasibility","Linkage","scalability","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","England","CONCLUSIONS","Future studies","accounting"],"language":"en"},

Previous phylogeny-based typing methods are mainly based on multiple sequence alignments of specific genes in the HEVs, but the results are not stable with respect to different choices of genes. Here we report a novel method for identification and typing of HEVs based on information derived from their whole genomes. Specifically, we calculate the k-mer based barcode image for each genome, HEV or other human viruses, for a fixed k, 1\u003Ck\u003C7, where a genome barcode is defined in terms of the k-mer frequency distribution across the whole genome for all combinations of k-mers. A phylogenetic tree is constructed using a barcode-based distance and a neighbor-joining method among a set of 443 representative non-HEV human viruses and 395 HEV sequences. The tree shows a clear separation of the HEV viruses from all the non-HEV viruses with 100% accuracy and a separation of the HEVs into four distinct clads with 93.4% consistency with a multiple sequence alignment-based phylogeny. Our detailed analyses of the HEVs having different typing results by the two methods indicate that our results are in better agreement with known information about the HEVs.","publish_time":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Chengguo; Wang, Guoqing; Chen, Xin; Huang, Honglan; Liu, Bin; Xu, Ying; Li, Fan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3d75d7baf118918395a6950b724215ec2c8023c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3194813.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22022592/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEVs","non-HEV viruses","barcode-based distance","representative non-HEV human viruses","HEV sequences","genome barcode","different typing results","Previous phylogeny-based typing methods","multiple sequence alignment-based phylogeny","human enterovirus","barcode image","Identification","different choices of genes","multiple sequence alignments of specific genes","known information","clear separation","novel method","phylogenetic tree","mer frequency distribution","set","respect","neighbor","accuracy","better agreement","consistency","pathogen detection","terms","detailed analyses","therapy","combinations","mers","genomes"],"language":"en"},

Children infected with MTB are more likely to progress to active TB (ATB); however, the molecular mechanism behind this process has long been a mystery. We employed the label-free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize differences in plasma proteins between ATB and latent TB infection (LTBI) in children. To detect differences that are indicative of MTB infection, we first selected proteins whose expressions were markedly different between the ATB and LTBI groups and the control groups (inflammatory disease control (IDC) and healthy control (HC) groups). A total of 521 proteins differed (\u003E 1.5-fold or \u003C 0.6-fold) in the LTBI group, and 318 proteins in the ATB group when compared with the control groups. Of these, 49 overlapping proteins were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed most proteins had a cellular and organelle distribution. The MTB infection status was mainly related to differences in binding, cellular and metabolic processes. XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A were selected and further verified by qPCR and western blot. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with LTBI. At the protein level, the expression of all these proteins by western blot in ATB/LTBI was consistent with the trends from proteomic detection. Our results provide important data for future mechanism studies and biomarker selection for MTB infection in children.","publish_time":"2017-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jieqiong; Sun, Lin; Xu, Fang; Xiao, Jing; Jiao, Weiwei; Qi, Hui; Shen, Chen; Shen, Adong","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5732728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262562/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.21179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["MTB","ATB","LTBI","ATB/LTBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LTBI groups","ATB group","selected proteins","control groups","plasma proteins","overlapping proteins","indicative of MTB infection","MTB infection status","differences","Children","latent TB infection","healthy control","inflammatory disease control","expression of XRCC4","active TB","western blot","fold","PCF11and SEMA4A","molecular mechanism","proteomic detection","infectious disease","mRNA level","protein level","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","future mechanism studies","label-free quantitative proteomic technology","biomarker selection","IDC","increased trend","important data","results","binding","trends","analysis","HC","expressions","metabolic processes","ATP11A","organelle distribution","Gene Ontology","qPCR","mystery","total"],"language":"en"},

During 11 weeks of the influenza epidemic period in January\u2013March 2012, consecutive adult patients suspected to be septic (n = 432) were analyzed with cultures from blood and nasopharynx plus multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses on the nasopharyngeal specimen. The results were compared with those from microbiology analyses ordered as part of standard care. During the winter season, viral respiratory pathogens, mainly influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were clinically underdiagnosed in 70% of patients positive by the multiplex PCR assay. During the first four weeks of the influenza epidemic, few tests for influenza were ordered by clinicians, indicating low awareness that the epidemic had started. Nasopharyngeal findings of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae by culture correlated to pneumonia diagnosis, and in those patients laboratory signs of viral co-infections were common but rarely suspected by clinicians. The role of respiratory viral infections in patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis is underestimated. Specific antiviral treatment might be beneficial in some cases and may reduce spread in a hospital setting. Diagnosing viral infections may promote reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use. It can also be a tool for decisions concerning patient logistics, in order to minimize exposure of susceptible patients and personnel.

To initiate the infective cycle, the viral genome must therefore translocate from the viral particle to the cytoplasm. Via distinct proteins or motifs in their outermost shell, the particles attach initially to specific molecules on the host cell surface. These virus receptors thus mediate penetration of the viral genome inside the cell, where the intracellular infective cycle starts. The presence of these receptors on the cell surface is a principal determinant of virus host tropism. Viruses can use diverse types of molecules to attach to and enter into cells. In addition, virus-receptor recognition can evolve over the course of an infection, and virus variants with distinct receptor-binding specificities and tropism can appear. The identification of virus receptors and the characterization of virus-receptor interactions have been major research goals in virology for the last two decades.

We detected fifteen substitutions of nucleotides by comparisons with the seventeen published SARS-CoV genome sequences, eight (53.3%) of which are non-synonymous mutations leading to amino acid alternations with predicted physiochemical changes. The possible antigenic determinants of the S protein are predicted, and the result is confirmed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with synthesized peptides. Another profound finding is that three disulfide bonds are defined at the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the E (envelope) protein, based on the typical sequence and positions, thus establishing the structural connection with these two important structural proteins, if confirmed.

Most of the suspected viral zoonotic diseases affecting human patients remain unidentified with regard to their aetiological agent. The aim of this study is to summarize the state of knowledge of the viral richness associated with wild mammals in Mexico throughout 1900\u20132018 and their relationship with human cases. We compiled two databases, one of them containing all available published studies on potentially zoonotic viruses in wild mammals and another with human cases related to zoonotic viruses. The database on wild mammals covers the period of 1900\u20132018; the human case database spans 2000\u20132013. We calculated the richness of viral potential zoonotic agents and evaluated their geographical distribution. We found 262 records of 42 potential zoonotic viral species associated with 92 wild mammal species in 28 states across Mexico. Records of human viral cases were only found in 29 states, which did not overlap with the reports in wild mammals. We detected 25.6% (42/164) of viral zoonotic agents reported worldwide.

This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-\u03B1 mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-\u03B3 mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24\u201348 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1\u20132 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 induction. A combination of IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B3 gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.","publish_time":"2005-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castilletti, Concetta; Bordi, Licia; Lalle, Eleonora; Rozera, Gabriella; Poccia, Fabrizio; Agrati, Chiara; Abbate, Isabella; Capobianchi, Maria R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3e6434f5049b3a509e05f5d7119b835ed060b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111739.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205004241; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205004241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOI","PBMC","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV virus","IFN induction","fixed SARS-CoV","IFN-\u03B3 mRNA","eliciting IFN-\u03B1","inhibited SARS-CoV replication","IFN-\u03B1 mRNA induction","combination of IFN","efficient IFN expression","capability of SARS","\u03B3 induction","\u03B3 expression","coordinate induction of IFN","Concomitant activation of IFN","Virus replication","\u03B3 gene expression","strong inhibition of SARS","\u03B3 mRNA accumulation","infected cells","infected Vero cells","Cocultivation of PBMC","direct effect of viral replication","cocultivation of normal PBMC","live virus","infectious virus progeny","produced viral genomic RNA","infected cultures","days of infection","study","lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration","transient peak of negative strand viral RNA","emerging infection","immunomediated damage","tissue damage","prolonged observation time","time course curve","over-exuberant immune response","protein release","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","proliferation","exposure","lymphomonocytes","dose-dependent manner","Abstract Background","tissues","healthy donors","novel coronavirus","evidence","possible involvement","result of combined cytokine action","disease","MOI","single cytokines","Results","day period","pathogenesis","Conclusions","types","plateau"],"language":"en"},

A decade later, One Health advocates face increasing pressure to translate the approach from theory into action. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A qualitative case study methodology was used to examine the emerging relationships between international One Health dialogue and its practical implementation in the African health policy context. A series of Key Informant Interviews (n = 32) with policy makers, government officials and academics in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda are presented as three separate case studies. Each case examines a significant aspect of One Health operationalisation, framed around the control of both emerging and Neglected Zoonotic Diseases including HPAI, Human African Trypanosomiasis and rabies. The research found that while there is general enthusiasm and a strong affirmative argument for adoption of One Health approaches in Africa, identifying alternative contexts away from a narrow focus on pandemics will help broaden its appeal, particularly for national or regionally significant endemic and neglected diseases not usually addressed under a \u201Cglobal\u201D remit. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to achieving the intersectoral collaboration, significant resource mobilisation and political co-operation required to realise a One Health approach. Individual country requirements cannot be underestimated, dismissed or prescribed in a top down manner.

Key to these efforts is public access to information that is understandable, reliable and meets their needs for informed decision-making on protective health behaviours. Learning from the trends in sources used in previous outbreaks will enable improvements in information access in future outbreaks. Two separate random-digit dialled telephone surveys were conducted in Alberta, Canada, to explore information sources used by the public, together with their perceived usefulness and credibility, during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic (n = 1209) and 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic (n = 1206). Traditional mass media were the most used information sources in both surveys. Although use of the Internet increased from 25% during SARS to 56% during H1N1, overall use of social media was not as high as anticipated. Friends and relatives were commonly used as an information source, but were not deemed very useful or credible. Conversely, doctors and health professionals were considered credible, but not consulted as frequently. The use of five or more information sources increased by almost 60% between the SARS and H1N1 surveys. There was a shift to older, more educated and more affluent respondents between the surveys, most likely caused by a decrease in the use of landlines amongst younger Canadians. It was concluded that people are increasingly using multiple sources of health risk information, presumably in a complementary manner. Subsequently, although using online media is important, this should be used to augment rather than replace more traditional information channels. Efforts should be made to improve knowledge transfer to health care professionals and doctors and provide them with opportunities to be more accessible as information sources. Finally, the future use of telephone surveys needs to account for the changing demographics of the respondents accessed through such surveys.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jardine, Cynthia G.; Boerner, Franziska U.; Boyd, Amanda D.; Driedger, S.

Efficient live attenuated vaccines against classical swine fever virus (CSFV) are used routinely in endemic countries.

Molecular epidemiology studies in these regions suggests that the virus circulating in the field has evolved under the positive selection pressure exerted by the immune response to the vaccine, leading to new attenuated viral variants. Recent work by our group demonstrated that a high proportion of persistently infected piglets can be generated by early postnatal infection with low and moderately virulent CSFV strains. Here, we studied the immune response to a hog cholera lapinised virus vaccine (HCLV), C-strain, in six-week-old persistently infected pigs following post-natal infection. CSFV-negative pigs were vaccinated as controls. The humoral and interferon gamma responses as well as the CSFV RNA loads were monitored for 21 days post-vaccination. No vaccine viral RNA was detected in the serum samples and tonsils from CSFV postnatally persistently infected pigs for 21 days post-vaccination. Furthermore, no E2-specific antibody response or neutralising antibody titres were shown in CSFV persistently infected vaccinated animals. Likewise, no of IFN-gamma producing cell response against CSFV or PHA was observed.

Some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to Charadriiformes lineages, but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses. Australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses, but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available.

Following a PED outbreak that occurred in China in 2010, the disease was identified for the first time in the United States in April 2013, and was reported in many other countries worldwide from 2013 to 2014. As a novel approach to elucidate the epidemiological relationship between PEDV strains, we explored their genome sequences to identify the motifs that were shared within related strains. Of PED outbreaks reported in many countries during 2013\u20132014, 119 PEDV strains in Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Korea were selected and used in this study. We developed a motif mining program, which aimed to identify a specific region of the genome that was exclusively shared by a group of PEDV strains. Eight motifs were identified (M1\u2013M8) and they were observed in 41, 9, 18, 6, 10, 14, 2, and 2 strains, respectively. Motifs M1\u2013M6 were shared by strains from more than two countries, and seemed to originate from one PEDV strain, Indiana12.83/USA/2013, among the 119 strains studied. BLAST search for motifs M1\u2013M6 revealed that M3\u2013M5 were almost identical to the strain ZMDZY identified in 2011 in China, while M1 and M2 were similar to other Chinese strains isolated in 2011\u20132012. Consequently, the PED outbreaks in these six countries may be closely related, and multiple transmissions of PEDV strains between these countries may have occurred during 2013\u20132014. Although tools such as phylogenetic tree analysis with whole genome sequences are increasingly applied to reveal the connection between isolates, its interpretation is sometimes inconclusive. Application of motifs as a tool to examine the whole genome sequences of causative agents will be more objective and will be an explicit indicator of their relationship.","publish_time":"2016-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamamoto, Takehisa; Suzuki, Tohru; Ohashi, Seiichi; Miyazaki, Ayako; Tsutsui, Toshiyuki","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55248fb2e12f9712b35a26e3fdb723baea0ac775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4726493.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808527/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PED"],"locations":["United States","Mexico","China"],"keyphrases":["related strains","group of PEDV strains","Chinese strains","countries","Motifs M1","multiple transmissions of PEDV strains","Application of motifs","PED outbreaks","genome sequences of causative agents","M6","China","epidemiological relationship","strain ZMDZY","positive-sense RNA virus","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Mexico","infectious gastroenteritis","phylogenetic tree analysis","Canada","M3","M2","Japan","Germany","M5","BLAST search","time","isolates","interpretation","tools","explicit indicator","novel approach","pigs","Indiana12","motif mining program","United States","connection","Korea","disease","specific region","M8","study"],"language":"en"},

No studies in children have tested for an extended panel of upper airway respiratory viruses and bacteria to identify whether they predict cough outcomes, irrespective of clinical diagnosis at the time of acute respiratory illness (ARI). We therefore determined whether upper airway microbes independently predicted hospitalization and persistent cough 28\u2010days later in children presenting with an ARI, including cough as a symptom. Methods: A cohort study of children aged \u003C15\u2010years were followed for 28\u2010days after presenting to a pediatric emergency department with an ARI where cough was also a symptom. Socio\u2010demographic factors, presenting clinical features and a bilateral anterior nasal swab were collected at enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction assays tested for seven respiratory bacteria and 17 viruses. Predictors of hospitalization and persistent cough at day\u201028 were evaluated in logistic regression models. Results: Eight hundred and seventeen children were included in the analysis; median age 27.7\u2010months. 116 (14.2%, 95%CI 11.8, 16.6) children were hospitalized and 163 (20.0%, 95%CI 17.2, 22.7) had persistent cough at day\u201028. Hospitalized children were more likely to have RSV A or B detected on nasal swab than those not admitted (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.8, 95%CI 1.0, 3.3). M. catarrhalis was the only microbial difference between children with and without cough persistence (aRR for those with cough at day 28: 2.1, 95%CI 1.3, 3.1). Discussion: An etiologic role for M. catarrhalis in the pathogenesis of persistent cough post\u2010ARI is worth exploring, especially given the burden of chronic cough in children and its relationship with chronic lung disease.

No, or not yet, is the qualified answer based on the evidence available. Although more than 200 viruses - some of them deadly zoonotic viruses - have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moratelli, Ricardo; Calisher, Charles H","journal":"Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51b8bdc5f732c68e830a09eb2ecd73191e6df2dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4371215.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742261/; https://doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760150048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bats","bat viruses","emerging viruses","deadly zoonotic viruses","evidence available","competent hosts","epidemiology of diseases","human diseases","disease outbreaks","mammalian intermediate hosts","aspects of bat biology","evolutionary-based hypotheses","viral transmission route","ecology","indirect roles","supposed connections","historical synthesis","medical investigations","geographic concentration","qualified answer","speculations","formal assessment","review","rabies","direction","point","asked question"],"language":"en"},

HCMV is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infected patients with AIDS, and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients. Current treatments for HCMV-associated diseases are insufficient due to the emergence of drug-induced resistance and cytotoxicity, necessitating novel approaches to limit HCMV infection. The aim of this study was to develop therapeutic peptides targeting glycoprotein B (gB), a major glycoprotein of HCMV that is highly conserved across the Herpesviridae family, that specifically inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane preventing HCMV entry and infection. RESULTS: Using the Wimley-White Interfacial Hydrophobicity Scale (WWIHS), several regions within gB were identified that display a high potential to interact with lipid bilayers of cell membranes and hydrophobic surfaces within proteins. The ability of synthetic peptides analogous to WWIHS-positive sequences of HCMV gB to inhibit viral infectivity was evaluated. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI), preincubated with peptides at a range of concentrations (78 nm to 100 \u03BCM), and GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy and analyzed quantitatively by flow cytometry. Peptides that inhibited HCMV infection demonstrated different inhibitory concentration curves indicating that each peptide possesses distinct biophysical properties. Peptide 174-200 showed 80% inhibition of viral infection at a concentration of 100 \u03BCM, and 51% and 62% inhibition at concentrations of 5 \u03BCM and 2.5 \u03BCM, respectively. Peptide 233-263 inhibited infection by 97% and 92% at concentrations of 100 \u03BCM and 50 \u03BCM, respectively, and 60% at a concentration of 2.5 \u03BCM. While peptides 264-291 and 297-315, individually failed to inhibit viral infection, when combined, they showed 67% inhibition of HCMV infection at a concentration of 0.125 \u03BCM each. CONCLUSIONS: Peptides designed to target putative fusogenic domains of gB provide a basis for the development of novel therapeutics that prevent HCMV infection.","publish_time":"2011-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melnik, Lilia I; Garry, Robert F; Morris, Cindy A","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d92312dac3822da87cb86d3de9fe818e0ee2874.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3050824.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21342525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["inhibition of HCMV infection","\u03BCM","limit HCMV infection","HCMV entry","inhibition of viral infection","inhibited infection","major glycoprotein of HCMV","HCMV-associated diseases","prevalent congenital viral infection","WWIHS-positive sequences of HCMV gB","hours post-infection","Towne-GFP strain of HCMV","therapeutic peptides","viral envelope","viral infectivity","ability of synthetic peptides analogous","Human cytomegalovirus","range of concentrations","putative fusogenic domains of gB","different inhibitory concentration curves","host cell membrane","human immunodeficiency virus","GFP-positive cells","Human foreskin fibroblasts","lipid bilayers of cell membranes","novel approaches","glycoprotein B","infected patients","allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients","development of novel therapeutics","solid organ","United States","significant morbidity","cytotoxicity","AIDS","immunocompromised individuals","HIV","Europe","basis","induced resistance","hydrophobic surfaces","fluorescence microscopy","Wimley-White Interfacial Hydrophobicity Scale","mortality","emergence of drug","opportunistic pathogen","mother","HFF","proteins","fusion","Current treatments","MOI","high potential","distinct biophysical properties","Herpesviridae family","study","regions","nm","BACKGROUND","flow cytometry","child","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Darong; Li, Nan L.; Wei, Dahai; Liu, Baoming; Guo, Fang; Elbahesh, Husni; Zhang, Yunzhi; Zhou, Zhi; Chen, Guo-Yun; Li, Kui","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/576b829eeb6838282aa2ffdfa925301e2888bb9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6623546.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","NHL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction","ZIKV infection","depletion of TRIM56","Overexpression of TRIM56","inhibited ZIKV RNA replication","ZIKV restriction factor","RNA-binding protein","RNA binding protein","recombinant TRIM56 fragment","short C-terminal portion","C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology","viral RNA levels","short C-terminal tail portion","antiviral activity","NHL proteins","cells of neural","E3 ligase-dead mutant","miRNA activity","antiviral mechanism","infected cells","E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections","NHL repeat of TRIM","indicative of direct interaction","host tripartite motif","host intrinsic mechanisms","concomitant","cell-free reactions","new insights","knockout of Dicer","demonstrable effect","loss","residues","line of defense","neurological disorders","production of miRNAs","significant health threat","barrier","fibroblast origins","invading pathogens","microcephaly","Zika virus","deletion","study","Innate immunity"],"language":"en"},

Our results showed that (\u002B)-catechin exerts an inhibitory effect on TGEV proliferation in vitro and is involved its antioxidation.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Wulong; He, Lei; Ning, Pengbo; Lin, Jihui; Li, Helin; Lin, Zhi; Kang, Kai; Zhang, Yanming","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd0247398430745d6a336f3b7dc642144292987b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528815300588; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528815300588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26679792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catechin treatment","TGEV genome","TGEV infection","TGEV proliferation","TGEV RNA replication","catechin-treated cultures","catechin alleviated ROS conditions","TGEV-infected ST cells","inhibitory effect","antiviral effect","post-treatment application","dose-dependent rescue effect","ABSTRACT Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Intracellular reactive oxygen species","Quantitative real-time PCR analysis","detection","newborn piglets","worldwide pig industry","log10 units","viral yields","Viability assays","antioxidation","study","results"],"language":"en"},

A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.

If new mutants of SARS coronavirus do initiate another epidemic, administration of prophylactic antibodies to risk groups may supplement the stringent isolation procedures that contained the first SARS outbreak. Method We developed a mathematical model to investigate the effects of hospital admission and targeted antibody prophylaxis on the reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary cases generated by an index case, during different SARS outbreak scenarios. Results Assuming a basic reproduction number R 0=3, admission of patients to hospital within 4.3 days of symptom onset is necessary to achieve outbreak control without the need to further reduce community-based transmission. Control may be enhanced by providing pre-exposure prophylaxis to contacts of hospitalized patients, and through contact tracing and provision of post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibody prophylaxis may also be employed to reduce R below one and thereby restrict outbreak size and duration. Conclusions Patient isolation alone can be sufficient to control SARS outbreaks provided that the time from onset to admission is short. Antibody prophylaxis as supplemental measure generally allows for containment of higher R 0 values and restricts both the size and duration of an outbreak.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogaards, Johannes Antonie; Putter, Hein; Jan Weverling, Gerrit; ter Meulen, Jan; Goudsmit, Jaap","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/438d02d1c5996c9c93d865d3c048e9e0c097ed0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106269.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893906000202; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893906000202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak control","outbreak size","SARS outbreaks","targeted antibody prophylaxis","different SARS outbreak scenarios","pre-exposure prophylaxis","basic reproduction number R","admission of patients","new mutants of SARS coronavirus","provision of post-exposure prophylaxis","effects of hospital admission","containment of higher R","duration","number of secondary cases","hospitalized patients","days of symptom onset","stringent isolation procedures","Conclusions Patient isolation","risk groups","contact tracing","index case","Summary Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","administration of prophylactic antibodies","epidemic","time","supplemental measure","values","viruses","need","Results","mathematical model","community-based transmission","animal reservoirs","Method"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the KRG extract on the ILI incidence in healthy adults. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza seasons. A total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. The subjects will be instructed to take 9 capsules per day of either the KRG extract or a placebo for a period of 3 months. The primary outcome measure is to assess the frequency of ILI onset in participated subjects. Secondary variable measures will be included severity and duration of ILI symptoms. The ILI symptoms will be scored by subjects using a 4-point scale. DISCUSSION: This study is a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the KRG extract compared to placebo and will be provided valuable new information about the clinical and physiological effects of the KRG extract on reduction of ILI incidence including flu and upper respiratory tract infections. The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if KRG extract can be shown to be an effective reduction strategy in ILI incidence.

As many as 40% of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are reported to be infected with more than one type of virus. However, it is not clear whether these infections are more severe than single viral infections. Mathematical models can be used to help us understand the dynamics of respiratory viral coinfections and their impact on the severity of the illness. Most models of viral infections use ordinary differential equations (ODE) that reproduce the average behavior of the infection, however, they might be inaccurate in predicting certain events because of the stochastic nature of viral replication cycle. Stochastic simulations of single virus infections have shown that there is an extinction probability that depends on the size of the initial viral inoculum and parameters that describe virus-cell interactions. Thus the coinfection dynamics predicted by the ODE might be difficult to observe in reality. RESULTS: In this work, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model is formulated to investigate probabilistic outcomes of coinfections. This CTMC model is based on our previous coinfection model, expressed in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations. Using the Gillespie method for stochastic simulation, we examine whether stochastic effects early in the infection can alter which virus dominates the infection. CONCLUSIONS: We derive extinction probabilities for each virus individually as well as for the infection as a whole. We find that unlike the prediction of the ODE model, for similar initial growth rates stochasticity allows for a slower growing virus to out-compete a faster growing virus.

Unlike most members of the T-box family, TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors which function as transcriptional repressors, mediated by the repression domain in the C-terminal. In addition to a role in development, recent evidence suggests that TBX2 and TBX3 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers. However, there is little information about the mechanisms for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis. Upregulation of TBX2 and TBX3 suppresses the expression of p14ARF and p21CIP1 and promotes bypass of senescence through inactivation of p53 pathway. TBX2 functionally interacts with pRb, and pRb modulates TBX2 functional specificity. In addition, TBX2 is a player of Wnt signaling while TBX3 is a downstream target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 represses the expression of E-cadherin, which is demonstrated to be a prerequisite for epithelial tumor cell invasion. Moreover, TBX2 is shown to interact with EGR1 to block multiple downstream tumor suppressors.

There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known. Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. Results A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012\u2013October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%\u201381.8%). Overall, the detection rate of MERS infection among asymptomatic contacts was 1-3.9% in studies included in this review. Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases. Of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation. Conclusions The proportion of asymptomatic MERS cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime. Those patients were less likely to have comorbid disease and may contribute to the transmission of the virus.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae7e5e5093d61a99b23cbca955555f7884011ec2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110966.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550839/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893918303430; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893918303430; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.12.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["proportion of asymptomatic MERS cases","proportion of asymptomatic cases","asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection","extent of asymptomatic MERS infection","confirmed cases","pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases","transmission of MERS","role of asymptomatic individuals","fatal cases","early cases","identified pediatric cases","policy of testing asymptomatic contacts","detection rate of MERS infection","review","comorbid disease","relevant papers","exact role","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","change","Abstract Background","Scopus databases","increasing frequency","multiple healthcare associated outbreaks","underlying condition","PCR laboratory","MEDLINE","PubMed","Conclusions","international attention","clear explanation","Method","overtime","final analysis","patients","studies","total"],"language":"en"},

MERS-CoV is primarily diagnosed using a real-time RT-PCR assay, with at least two different genomic targets required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition of The World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 July 2013. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow stable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a genetic diagnostic method used widely for the detection of viral pathogens, which requires only a single temperature for amplification, and can be completed in less than 1 h. This study developed a novel RT-LAMP assay for detecting MERS-CoV using primer sets targeting a conserved nucleocapsid protein region. RESULTS: The RT-LAMP assay was capable of detecting as few as 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA, and was highly specific, with no cross-reaction to other respiratory viruses. Pilot experiments to detect MERS-CoV from medium containing pharyngeal swabs inoculated with pre-titrated viruses were also performed. The RT-LAMP assay exhibited sensitivity similar to that of MERS-CoV real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the RT-LAMP assay described here is a useful tool for the diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance of human MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2014-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shirato, Kazuya; Yano, Takuya; Senba, Syouhei; Akachi, Shigehiro; Kobayashi, Takashi; Nishinaka, Takamichi; Notomi, Tsugunori; Matsuyama, Shutoku","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/767767546b54da4b2a51840674c68adfd4e1a0bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4132226.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103205/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV real-time RT-PCR","copies of MERS","CoV RNA","novel RT-LAMP assay","stable diagnosis of MERS","real-time RT-PCR assay","epidemiologic surveillance of human MERS-CoV infections","positive diagnosis","specific genetic diagnostic methods","respiratory viruses","RESULTS","case definition","isothermal amplification","pre-titrated viruses","documented case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","medium containing pharyngeal swabs","primer sets","sensitivity similar","conserved nucleocapsid protein region","Reverse transcription-loop","useful tool","different genomic targets","World Health Organization","detection of viral pathogens","cross-reaction","study","Pilot experiments","single temperature","BACKGROUND","Saudi Arabia","CONCLUSIONS","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

Indigo-dyed textiles were widely traded along the legendary Silk Road that linked China to Europe. Today, due to the labor-intensive nature of indigo extraction at the household level, lifestyle changes and the widespread availability of commercially produced indigo paste, traditional indigo extraction methods have declined in villages. Yet Li textile weavers on Hainan Island are internationally recognized as producers of indigo-dyed textile using warp ikat techniques. In contrast, Hainan Miao weavers produce indigo-dyed textiles using batik (wax resist) techniques. The aim of this study was to document the indigenous knowledge on indigo-yielding plant species used by both Hainan Miao and Li people on Hainan Island, China. METHOD: Ethnic uses were documented during three field surveys, through a questionnaire survey of 193 respondents, comprising 144 Hainan Miao and 49 Li traditional dyers. Mention index (QI), Availability index (AI), and Preference ranking (PR) of each indigo-yielding plant species were calculated to screen out plant resources with potential development value. RESULTS: Five indigo-yielding plant species (from four plant families and four genera) were historically used by Hainan Miao and Li dyers. However, just four species are still in use. Strobilanthes cusia was the main indigo source for Hainan Miao dyers. Li dyers also commonly use Indigofera species (I. tinctoria and I. suffruticosa) for indigo extraction. Wrightia laevis is less commonly used as a contemporary indigo source. Indigo extraction by steeping in water to which lime is added to increase the pH is sharing by the five indigo-yielding plant species. Strobilanthes cusia had the highest QI, AI and PR values in Hainan Miao villages. Indigofera tinctoria had the highest QI and AI values, but Indigofera suffruticosa was preferred by Li dyers. CONCLUSION: In the process of modernization and urbanization, some Hainan Miao and Li dyers retain the traditional indigo extraction methods. We found that Strobilanthes cusia and Indigofera tinctoria have the most potential for sustainable indigo production in the future. Furthermore, this study documents the details of extraction method from Wrightia laevis for the first time and the use of Ricinus communis seeds in that process. As one of the last places globally where Wrightia laevis is still used for indigo production, the may also be a nice market among textile collectors and museums that keeps the tradition of Wrightia laevis production and use for indigo extraction alive.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Libin; Wang, Lu; Cunningham, Anthony B.; Shi, Yuru; Wang, Yuhua","journal":"J Ethnobiol Ethnomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de5427785ad1385b62f0fbf18af129dc8cff303f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6609400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-019-0314-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hainan Miao","Li"],"organizations":["Indigofera"],"locations":["Central Asia","United States","Central America","Europe","Hainan Island","China"],"keyphrases":["indigo paste","producers of indigo","indigo-yielding plant species","indigo extraction alive","Indigo-dyed textiles","traditional indigo extraction methods","sustainable indigo production","Hainan Miao dyers","main indigo source","contemporary indigo source","labor-intensive nature of indigo extraction","Li dyers","Hainan Miao weavers","Hainan Miao villages","Hainan Island","Indigofera species","Li traditional dyers","plant resources","plant families","Li textile weavers","Li people","Indigofera tinctoria","details of extraction method","Indigofera suffruticosa","tradition of Wrightia laevis production","Strobilanthes cusia","AI values","highest QI","PR values","textile collectors","Availability index","China","study","use of Ricinus communis seeds","Central Asia","Central America","widespread availability","Mention index","process of modernization","warp ikat techniques","potential development value","important cash crops","southern United States","museums","household level","batik","lifestyle changes","indigenous knowledge","wax resist","time","urbanization","field surveys","questionnaire survey","legendary Silk Road","nice market","Preference ranking","respondents","contrast","Ethnic uses","Europe","future","genera","water","RESULTS","lime","CONCLUSION","pH","places","BACKGROUND","aim"],"language":"en"},

Although exposure to some microbes is considered to be beneficial for health, more research is needed to properly assess their potential health hazards including inter-individual susceptibility, interactions with non-biological agents, and many proven/unproven health effects (e.g., atopy and atopic diseases).","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ki-Hyun; Kabir, Ehsanul; Jahan, Shamin Ara","journal":"Journal of Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45e7c863c8a0bf2f373a64c3d7ba1546ca26d672.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2017.08.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S100107421731478X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100107421731478X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health impacts","potential health hazards","unproven health effects","Abstract Bioaerosols","risk assessment of bioaerosols","exposure standards","respiratory diseases","fragments of microorganisms","atopic diseases","complexity of microorganisms","inter-individual susceptibility","interactions","non-biological agents","quantification","atopy","lack of valid quantitative criteria","identification","allergies","dose","effect relationships","conventional culture methods","distribution","techniques","metabolites","toxins","cancer","locations of sampling","pool of knowledge","purpose","derivatives","microbes","International interests","research","environment","factors"],"language":"en"},

However, the availability of human cadaver organs is limited and the demand for transplants is still on the rise. Also, there is a recognised lack of cells and human tissues for generalised use in transplantation for the treatment of diseases that are characterised by failure of specialised cells (such as pancreatic cells to cure diabetes). Xenotransplantation, which is the transplant of cells, tissues or organs from other species, became the focus of attention in the nineteen-nineties as a solution to the lack of organs and tissues for transplantation. Previous clinical studies using nonhuman primates produced poor outcomes (survival from days to a few months) and confirmed the difficulty of obtaining organs from these species. Since then, progress in xenotransplantation has been slow and still now various immunological and non-immunological barriers need to be overcome. These barriers are reviewed in this chapter and the various approaches explored to date to overcome them, in particular those based on the genetic modification of pigs. Also, cell transplant studies such as those of pancreatic islets in monkeys have led to even more hopeful results. The range of possibilities offered by this technology will be unlimited, making it possible for xenotransplantation to be a clinical reality in a not very distant future.","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa Vall\u00E9s, Cristina; M\u00E1\u00F1ez Mendiluce, Rafael","journal":"Stem Cell Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6186b922823e9d4da56c2b20bf24643c1e00f19b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-2098-9_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pancreatic cells","transplant of cells","lack of organs","Xenotransplantation","human tissues","recognised lack of cells","failure of specialised cells","solid organ transplantation","availability of human cadaver organs","species","Previous clinical studies","cell transplant studies","non-immunological barriers","treatment of choice","cases of irreversible organ failure","clinical reality","treatment of diseases","various approaches","pancreatic islets","nonhuman primates","poor outcomes","survival","generalised use","days","century","technology","immunosuppressive treatments","decades","months","monkeys","date","nineties","demand","chapter","difficulty","solution","genetic modification of pigs","distant future","focus of attention","transplants","range of possibilities","dvances","progress","diabetes","hopeful results","rise"],"language":"en"},

This study explored methods of follow up and sample collection for a proposed randomised controlled trial of influenza vaccination in children attending childcare. Methods: The study was conducted in four Sydney childcare centres during 2007. Healthy children aged 6\u201359 months eligible for vaccination were recruited in two centres, with another two acting as controls. Data on influenza\u2010like illness (ILI: \u226537.8\u00B0C plus at least one respiratory symptom) occurrence were collected weekly. In those children with an ILI, parents were asked to collect nasal swabs and send via surface mail for viral polymerase chain reaction. Vaccine efficacy (VE) for ILI was estimated overall and for subgroups aged 6\u201323 and 24\u201359 months using the formula VE = 1 \u2212 relative risk (RR). Results: Sixty\u2010three per cent (151/238) of eligible children had parents give consent. Sixty\u2010three children received influenza vaccine and 88 participated as controls. Of 26 specimens returned, a virus was detected in 18 (69%); none with influenza. Two symptomatic children had positive near\u2010patient influenza tests in general practice (one a vaccine failure). The RR with 95% confidence interval in all children and those aged 6\u201323 months were less than one, 0.56 (0.32\u20131.02) and 0.46 (0.15\u20131.45), respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of parent\u2010collected and mailed respiratory specimens for VE research in the childcare setting. Two\u2010thirds of parent\u2010collected swabs proved positive for at least one virus. Finding ways to reduce reluctance of parents to submit samples could improve the representativeness of samples collected and the power of the study.

The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. Methods A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (\u00B118,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (\u00B13298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (\u00B11819) deaths. This would overwhelm India\u0027s healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (\u00B133,735) total infections, 10,214 (\u00B11649) hospitalizations, 2121 (\u00B1334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (\u00B1169) deaths. Conclusion At the current growth rate of epidemic, India\u0027s healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by the end of May.

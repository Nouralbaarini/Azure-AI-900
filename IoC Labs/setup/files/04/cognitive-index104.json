The activation of a number of serine proteases, including GzmA and B, is predominately mediated by cathepsin C (CatC). Deficiencies in CatC\u2010null mice were therefore expected to replicate the defects observed in GzmAB\u2010deficient mice. We have previously determined that GzmAB\u2010deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Here, we have compared the ability of CatC(\u2212/\u2212) mice to control MCMV infection with that of GzmAB\u2010deficient animals. We found that CatC(\u2212/\u2212) mice have organ\u2010specific defects in the ability to control MCMV replication, a phenotype that is distinct to that observed in GzmAB(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Significantly, the cytolytic function of CatC\u2010deficient NK cells and CTLs elicited during infection was indistinguishable from that of wild\u2010type cells. Hence, CatC is involved in limiting MCMV replication; however, this effect is independent of its role in promoting effector cytolytic activity. These data provide evidence for a novel and unexpected role of CatC during viral infection.","publish_time":"2010-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andoniou, Christopher E; Fleming, Peter; Sutton, Vivien R; Trapani, Joseph A; Degli\u2010Esposti, Mariapia A","journal":"Immunol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72fa523e4c5437e88d4fe41d90b5292f277802ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2010.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20975734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deficient mice","ability of CatC","MCMV infection","GzmAB","null mice","deficient NK cells","unexpected role of CatC","cytolytic function of CatC","MCMV replication","type cells","viral infection","deficient animals","CTLs","Destruction of target cells","number of serine proteases","family of serine proteases","specific defects","effector cytolytic activity","increased susceptibility","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","murine cytomegalovirus","coordinated action","natural killer","Pfp","protein perforin","pore","granzyme","novel","evidence","organ","activation","phenotype","Deficiencies","cathepsin C","data"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. Aim of the work This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patients and methods This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99\u00B113.03years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. Results The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P \u003C0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P \u003C0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P \u003C0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P \u003C0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r =0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P \u003C0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P \u003C0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11\u00B13.70 vs 24.21\u00B13.82), SOFA score (5.83\u00B12.64 vs 8.85\u00B12.17) and CPIS (7.55\u00B11.14 vs 8.64\u00B11.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P \u003C0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P \u003E0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r =0.633), obesity (r =0.712), diabetes mellitus (r =0.685), renal failure (r =0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r =0.523), malignancy (r =0.692), kidney transplantation (r =0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r =0.525) (P \u003C0.05). There was a statistically (P \u003C0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r =0.735). Conclusions Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients\u2019 hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halim, Ashraf Abdel; Alsayed, Badr; Embarak, Sameh; Yaseen, Taha; Dabbous, Salwa","journal":"Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbab61c03b58e81082109fa56830f400890485fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132710.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763815301199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288128/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763815301199; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2015.11.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","APACHE II","CPIS"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["expired patients","MERS corona patients","included patients","MERS corona virus infected patients","survivors","expired group","significant difference","new corona virus","smoking severity","significant positive correlation","confirmed MERS-CoV infection","presence of abdominal symptoms","Current smoking","significant decrease","Prolonged duration of symptoms","presence of associated co-morbidities","renal failure","sputum","main symptoms","vs","number of associated co-morbidities","poor outcome of ICU","hypoxemic respiratory failure","renal transplantation","sore throat","old age","mean age","abdominal pain","bilateral pulmonary infiltrates","novel respiratory illness","prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation","bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates","throat swab","unilateral infiltrates","severe acute respiratory illness","diabetes mellitus","chronic heart diseases","COPD","malignancy","obesity","strong predictors of mortality","liver cirrhosis","fever","dyspnea","clinical characteristics","cough","statistical difference","runny nose","bad prognosis","work","results","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","total hospital","patients\u2019 hospitalization","outcome of intensive care unit","kidney transplantation","SOFA score","chest pain","mean values of APACHE","rRT-PCR","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","tracheal aspirate","test","laboratory","PaO2","O2 saturation","increased bronchovascular markings","normal radiology","PH","differences","study","bronchoalveolar lavage specimens","HCO3","Saudi Arabia","Diagnosis","methods","PaCO2","people","comparison","Conclusions","nausea","myalgia","hemoptysis","vomiting","headache","years","CPIS","diarrhea","subjects","females"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, \u002B46, and \u002B79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of atopy on the course of disease in children hospitalised with viral pneumonia. Methods Children between the ages of 1 and 6 years hospitalised due to viral pneumonia between the years of 2013 and 2016 were included to this multicentre study. Patients were classified into two groups as mild\u2013moderate and severe according to the course of pneumonia. Presence of atopy was evaluated with skin prick tests. Groups were compared to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe viral pneumonia. Results A total of 280 patients from nine centres were included in the study. Of these patients, 163 (58.2%) were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), Influenza A (20.5%), rhinovirus (18.9%), adenovirus (10%), human metapneumovirus (8%), parainfluenza (5.2%), coronavirus (6%), and bocavirus (1.6%) were isolated from respiratory samples. Eighty-five (30.4%) children had severe pneumonia. Atopic sensitisation was found in 21.4% of the patients.

Endotoxin concentrations were measured with the chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Assay and used as a direct measure of bacterial products whilst soluble CD14 (sCD14), measured with ELISA was selected as an indicator of the early host response to endotoxins. Endotoxin concentrations in this cohort were generally elevated but did not differ with the presentation of fever. Further stratification of the febrile episodes based on the microbiological findings revealed significantly (p = 0.0077) elevated endotoxin concentrations in FUO episodes compared with episodes with documented bacterial and viral findings. sCD14 concentrations were however, elevated in febrile episodes (p = 0.0066) and no association was observed between sCD14 concentration and microbiological findings. However, FUO episodes and episodes with Gram-negative bacteraemia were associated with higher median sCD14 concentrations than episodes with Gram-positive bacteraemia (p = 0.030).

We used experimental human pneumococcal carriage to investigate whether upper respiratory tract viral infection predisposes individuals to carriage. A total of 101 healthy subjects were screened for respiratory virus before pneumococcal intranasal challenge. Virus was associated with increased odds of colonization (75% virus positive became colonized vs. 46% virus-negative subjects; P=0.02). Nasal Factor H (FH) levels were increased in virus-positive subjects and were associated with increased colonization density. Using an in vitro epithelial model we explored the impact of increased mucosal FH in the context of coinfection. Epithelial inflammation and FH binding resulted in increased pneumococcal adherence to the epithelium. Binding was partially blocked by antibodies targeting the FH-binding protein Pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC). PspC epitope mapping revealed individuals lacked antibodies against the FH binding region. We propose that FH binding to PspC in vivo masks this binding site, enabling FH to facilitate pneumococcal/epithelial attachment during viral infection despite the presence of anti-PspC antibodies. We propose that a PspC-based vaccine lacking binding to FH could reduce pneumococcal colonization, and may have enhanced protection in those with underlying viral infection.","publish_time":"2015-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glennie, S; Gritzfeld, J F; Pennington, S H; Garner-Jones, M; Coombes, N; Hopkins, M J; Vadesilho, C F; Miyaji, E N; Wang, D; Wright, A D; Collins, A M; Gordon, S B; Ferreira, D M","journal":"Mucosal Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcc562cf2076fa55f32a63255fa5f71d0bed4f14.json; document_parses/pdf_json/04790b58fb060d76409de5a847b4b1f69a328bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4703943.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25921341/; https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2015.35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Binding"],"organizations":["Nasal Factor H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FH binding region","pneumococcal colonization","increased pneumococcal adherence","impact of increased mucosal FH","increased colonization density","FH-binding protein Pneumococcal surface protein C","increased odds of colonization","respiratory virus","virus positive","virus-positive subjects","virus-negative subjects","pneumococcal intranasal challenge","experimental human pneumococcal carriage","presence of anti-PspC antibodies","underlying viral infection","PspC epitope mapping","PspC-based vaccine","nasopharyngeal colonization density","upper respiratory tract viral infection","individuals","epithelial attachment","healthy subjects","Epithelial inflammation","epithelial model","levels","enhanced protection","masks","Nasal Factor H","site","context of coinfection","epithelium","total","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

In the United States, inactivated and subunit PEDV vaccines for pregnant sows are available, but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from PEDV na\u00EFve sows. A safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC22A at the 100th cell culture passage level - Clone no. 4 (P100C4) and at the 120th passage level (P120), in weaned pigs. RESULTS: Four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with PEDV PC22A-P3 (virulent), -P100C4, -P120, and mock, respectively, and challenged with the P3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). After inoculation, P3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral RNA shedding. P100C4 and P120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs, although viral RNA was detected in feces of all pigs, except for one P100C4-inoculated pig. Compared with the P120 group, P3- and P100C4-inoculated pigs had higher serum PEDV-specific IgG and viral neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers at 14 dpi. After the challenge, no pigs in the P3 group but all pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups had diarrhea. Compared with the P120 group, pigs in the P100C4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers, higher titers of serum PEDV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs, and higher numbers of intestinal IgA Ab-secreting cells. CONCLUSIONS: PEDV PC22A P100C4 and P120 were fully attenuated in weaned pigs but failed to elicit protection against virulent P3 challenge. P100C4 induced higher PEDV-specific antibody responses than P120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge. Therefore, P100C4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics. It also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a PEDV vaccination regimen, whose efficacy can be tested in the future.

Based on the negative/positive cut-off median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of 2800, the microsphere immunoassay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% compared to ELISA. The immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against both BVDV-1 and the atypical pestivirus. This novel microsphere immunoassay has the potential to be multiplexed for simultaneous detection of antibodies against different bovine pathogens in a high-throughput and economical way.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijayaraghavan, Balaje; Xia, Hongyan; Harimoorthy, Rajiv; Liu, Lihong; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40e8efb2cb002dc7fb4b5a1dc7cb6c18d7e4f450.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119539.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412002303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766180/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412002303; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.06.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycoprotein Erns"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BVDV","atypical pestivirus","atypical bovine pestivirus Th","Abstract Atypical bovine pestiviruses","novel microsphere immunoassay","different bovine pathogens","simultaneous detection of antibodies","bovine viral diarrhea viruses","ELISA","Glycoprotein Erns","recombinant Erns protein","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","positive cut-off median fluorescence intensity","MFI","value","high-throughput","KhonKaen","potential","antigen","baculovirus expression system","new method","diagnostic performance","total","economical way","serum samples","sensitivity","affinity chromatography","clinical manifestations","animals","specificity"],"language":"en"},

In this review article, we examine the new picture of the evolution of RNA viruses, the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome, that is emerging from metagenomic data analysis. The major expansion of many groups of RNA viruses through metagenomics allowed the construction of substantially improved phylogenetic trees for the conserved virus genes, primarily, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). In particular, a new superfamily of widespread, small positive-strand RNA viruses was delineated that unites tombus-like and noda-like viruses. Comparison of the genome architectures of RNA viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon. Most dramatically, inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp resulted in the identification of numerous, strongly supported groups that encompass RNA viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists, animals and plants. Notwithstanding potential caveats, in particular, incomplete and uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa, these highly unexpected findings reveal horizontal virus transfer (HVT) between diverse hosts as the central aspect of RNA virus evolution. The vast and diverse virome of invertebrates, particularly nematodes and arthropods, appears to be the reservoir, from which the viromes of plants and vertebrates evolved via multiple HVT events.","publish_time":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dolja, Valerian V.; Koonin, Eugene V.","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5801114.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217306007; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29103997/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217306007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of RNA viruses","groups of RNA viruses","Virus metagenomics","RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","central aspect of RNA virus evolution","diverse virus genomes","genome architectures of RNA viruses","diverse hosts","small positive-strand RNA viruses","horizontal virus transfer","conserved virus genes","understanding of virus diversity","diverse virome of invertebrates","new picture","new level","RdRp","eukaryotic virome","different groups of protists","new superfamily of widespread","metagenomic data analysis","phylogenetic trees","phylogenetic analyses","viromes of plants","multiple HVT events","uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa","unexpected findings","extent of gene module","dominant component","traditional methods","construction","connections","previous appreciation","animals","nematodes","ecology","major expansion","arthropods","evolutionary phenomenon","potential caveats","identification of numerous","Comparison","inclusion","young research","tombus","review article","reservoir","noda"],"language":"en"},

Camels are the likely animal source for zoonotic infection, although exact transmission modes remain to be determined. Human-to-human transmission occurs sporadically. The wide geographic distribution of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels and ongoing transmissions to humans provides concern for the evolution of a MERS-CoV variant with efficient human-to-human transmission capabilities. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has occurred by analysis of full-length genomes or multiple concatenated genome fragments, which is time-consuming, costly and limited to high viral load samples. Objective To develop a simple, reliable MERS-CoV variant typing assay to facilitate monitoring of MERS-CoV diversity in animals and humans. Study Design Phylogenetic analysis of presently known full-length MERS-CoV genomes was performed to identify genomic regions with sufficient phylogenetic content to allow reliable MERS-CoV variant typing. RT-PCR assays targeting these regions were designed and optimized. Results A reverse-transcription PCR assay for MERS-CoV targeting a 615bp spike fragment provides a phylogenetic clustering of MERS-CoV variants comparable to that of full-length genomes. The detection limit corresponds to a cycle treshold value of \u223C35 with standard upE real time PCR assays on RNA isolated from MERS-CoV EMC. Nasal swabs from RT-PCR positive camels (Ct values 12.9\u201332.2) yielded reliable sequence information in 14 samples.

The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine. In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015. An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined. This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response. Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations. In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine. Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks. All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.

There are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel antiviral drugs to combat LASV. This task would be facilitated by the implementation of high throughput screens (HTS) to identify inhibitors of the activity of the virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) responsible for directing virus RNA genome replication and gene transcription. The use of live LASV for this purpose is jeopardized by the requirement of biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. We have developed a virus-free cell platform, where expression levels of reporter genes serve as accurate surrogates of vRNP activity, to develop cell-based assays compatible with HTS to identify inhibitors of LASV and LCMV mammarenavirus vRNP activities.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cubitt, Beatrice; Ortiz-Riano, Emilio; Cheng, Benson YH.; Kim, Yu-Jin; Yeh, Charles D.; Chen, Catherine Z.; Southall, N.O.E.; Zheng, Wei; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; de la Torre, Juan C.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84e52da5894b060f5642f40b6eac9d6df16a56c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954049.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219305170; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31786250/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219305170","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","FDA","LASV","HTS","LCMV"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of LASV","mammarenavirus Lassa","LCMV mammarenavirus vRNP activities","virus ribonucleoprotein","use of live LASV","prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","HTS","virus-free cell platform","high morbidity","virus RNA genome replication","accurate surrogates of vRNP activity","current anti-mammarenavirus therapy","high number of Lassa fever","implementation of high throughput screens","significant mortality","label use of ribavirin","cell-based assays compatible","licensed vaccines","FDA","LF","expression levels of reporter genes","febrile disease","Drug Administration","cases","novel antiviral drugs","gene transcription","neglected human pathogen of clinical significance","BSL4","requirement of biosafety level","unmet need","purpose","containment","Food","West Africa","Mounting evidence","effects","individuals","task"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cross-sectional nationwide telephone survey of 1,650 community-dwelling Korean adults aged 19 years and older was conducted in the later stage of the 2009\u20132010 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. The questionnaire identified the demographics, vaccination status of participants and all household members, barriers to non-vaccination, perceived threat, and preventive behaviors. In Korea, the overall rate of pandemic influenza vaccination coverage in the surveyed population was 15.5%; vaccination coverage in the high-risk group and non\u2013high-risk group was 47.3% and 8.0%, respectively. In the high-risk group, the most important triggering event for vaccination was receiving a notice from a public health organization. In the non\u2013high-risk group, vaccination was more strongly influenced by previous experience with influenza or mass media campaigns. In both groups, the most common reasons for not receiving vaccination was that their health was sufficient to forgo the vaccination, and lack of time. There was no significant difference in how either group perceived the threat or adopted preventive behavior. The predictive factors for pandemic influenza vaccination were being elderly (age \u226565 years), prior seasonal influenza vaccination, and chronic medical disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With the exception of vaccination coverage, the preventive behaviors of the high-risk group were not different from those of the non\u2013high-risk group during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic. For future pandemic preparedness planning, it is crucial to reinforce preventive behaviors to avoid illness before vaccination and to increase vaccination coverage in the high-risk group.","publish_time":"2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heo, Jung Yeon; Chang, Soung Hoon; Go, Min Jung; Kim, Young Mee; Gu, Sun Hye; Chun, Byung Chul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a13c79aab29bf6afdf2fe0cbd6269b1941e77ee0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3656839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23691175/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-vaccination","exception of vaccination coverage","prior seasonal influenza vaccination","overall rate of pandemic influenza vaccination coverage","vaccination status of participants","outbreak of pandemic influenza","preventive behaviors","high-risk groups","H1N1","future pandemic preparedness planning","barriers","years","perceived threat","public health organization","public perception","cross-sectional nationwide telephone survey","household members","community","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","surveyed population","previous experience","notice","chronic medical disease","important triggering event","mass media campaigns","Korean adults","demographics","motivation","predictive factors","illness","METHODOLOGY","SIGNIFICANCE","questionnaire","common reasons","later stage","CONCLUSIONS","significant difference","lack of time","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Eventhough China achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history achieved; health inequality remains endemic in China. Lessons from the effect of market crisis on health equity in Europe and other places has reignited interest in exploring the potential healthcare market aberrations that can trigger distributive injustice in healthcare resource allocation among China\u2019s provinces. Recently, many healthcare investors in China have become more concerned about capital preservation, and are responding by abandoning long term investments strategies in healthcare. This investment withdrawal en mass is perceived to be influenced by herding tendencies and can trigger or consolidate endemic health inequality. METHODS: Our study simultaneously employs four testing models (two state spaced models and two return dispersion models) to establish the existence of procyclical (herding) behavior among the stocks and its health equity implications. These are applied to a large set of data to compare and contrast results of herd formation among investors in fourteen healthcare sectors in China. RESULTS: The study reveals that apart from the cross sectional standard deviation (CSSD) model, the remaining two models and our augmented state space model yields significant evidence of herding in all subsectors of the healthcare market. We also find that the herding effect is more prominent during down movements of the market. CONCLUSION: Herding behavior may lead to contemporaneous loss of investor confidence and capital withdrawal and thereby deprive the healthcare sector of the much needed capital for expansion. Thus there may be obvious delay in efforts to bridge the gap in access to healthcare facilities, medical support services, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and advanced medical equipment across China. Moreover, a potential crash in the healthcare market is possible in the healthcare sector as a result of persistent herding tendencies among investors and that may have more damaging consequences for health inequality in China.","publish_time":"2016-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lulin, Zhou; Antwi, Henry Asante; Wang, Wenxin; Yiranbon, Ethel; Marfo, Emmanuel Opoku; Acheampong, Patrick","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96cd80ad6f658fdc8b0d5e8ce4e1eb1f1daa87f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4950590.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-016-0393-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Europe","China"],"keyphrases":["healthcare investors","largest healthcare market","healthcare facilities","healthcare sectors","potential healthcare market aberrations","healthcare resource allocation","endemic health inequality","Eventhough China","Herding behavior","herding effect","World Health Organization","health equity implications","universal health insurance coverage","effect of market crisis","significant evidence of herding","medical laboratory","medical supplies","testing models","capital withdrawal","result of persistent herding tendencies","state spaced models","medical support services","advanced medical equipment","return dispersion models","largest expansion of insurance coverage","needed capital","capital preservation","study","augmented state space model","potential crash","contrast results of herd formation","investment withdrawal en mass","pharmaceuticals","diagnostic substances","biotechnology","distributive injustice","human history","recent report","CSSD","access","contemporaneous loss of investor confidence","cross sectional standard deviation","gap","Europe","stocks","subsectors","China\u2019s provinces","damaging consequences","efforts","long term investments strategies","existence of procyclical","large set of data","movements","Lessons","places","obvious delay","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenesis of CRS involves many factors including genetics, status of the sinonasal microbiome, infections and environmental influences. Comorbidities associated with CRS include asthma, allergic rhinitis, bronchiectasis and certain kinds of immunodeficiency. CRS can be divided into different subtypes based on endotypes and phenotypes. Infectious CRS is one such category. The etiology of infectious CRS is usually secondary to chronic bacterial infection which commonly begins with a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Humoral antibody deficiencies can underlie difficult-to-treat or recurrent CRS. Infectious CRS can be treated with antimicrobials, topical or oral corticosteroids and nasal saline irrigations. Patients with CRS and humoral immunodeficiency may require an aggressive treatment approach including immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

However, they have not been described in the dog. The aim of this study was to document the HBPs of canine seminal plasma. Six pooled samples of seminal plasma from three crossbred dogs were used. The HBPs were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography and the fractions recovered were pooled. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on 12 and 18% vertical minigels. The stained gels were scanned and the molecular weight (kDa) values for each band within a lane were calculated by image analysis software. The electrophoresis analysis of the pooled eluded fractions identified 19 bands, with molecular weights varying from 61.5 to 5.2kDa. Previous studies, using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, identified two bands (67 and 58.6kDa), which were positively correlated with some semen parameters (sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal sperm and plasma membrane integrity). The 61.5kDa band detected in the present study apparently corresponded to the 58.6kDa band identified previously. Canine seminal plasma contained HBP; since HBP modulate the acrosome reaction in other species, they may have the same function in the dog. Further studies are necessary to better characterize this protein and determine if it is associated with fertility in the dog.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Souza, Fabiana Ferreira; Martins, Maria Isabel Mello; Fernandes, Carlos Eurico dos Santos; Ribolla, Paulo Eduardo Martins; Lopes, Maria Denise","journal":"Theriogenology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/505003a36bb8367a1d34b4c7b9e30b25f338c96c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103112.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X06001129; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X06001129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kDa band","HBPs of canine seminal plasma","pooled samples of seminal plasma","plasma membrane integrity","sperm vigor","normal sperm","sperm motility","one-dimensional SDS-PAGE","electrophoresis analysis","bands","pooled eluded fractions","species","fertility","molecular weights","acrosome reaction","present study","Previous studies","acrosomal reaction","heparin affinity chromatography","One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","image analysis software","Abstract Heparin-binding proteins","percentage","lane","values","semen parameters","crossbred dogs","stained gels","modulation","vertical minigels","aim","function"],"language":"en"},

A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR. 194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative. The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%. However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Lei; Liu, Wanbing; Zheng, Yaqiong; Jiang, Xiaojing; Kou, Guomei; Ding, Jinya; Wang, Qiongshu; Huang, Qianchuan; Ding, Yinjuan; Ni, Wenxu; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Tan, Li; Hu, Zhenhong; Xu, Weitian; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Bo; Tang, Zhongzhi; Zhang, Xinhua; Li, Honghua; Rao, Zhiguo; Jiang, Hui; Ren, Xingfeng; Wang, Shengdian; Zheng, Shangen","journal":"Microbres infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16cbc30ba04eaeaed964386b1c0a85fad245f52f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425648/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457920300861; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300861?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected SARS-CoV","positive rates of viral RNA","antibody positive rates","positive rate of viral RNA","suspected patients","positive rate of antibodies","initial onset of symptoms","days","confirmed patients","combination of serological assay","ELISA assay","diagnostic value of serological assay","confirmation of viral infection","N protein of SARS","day post-disease onset","IgG antibodies","IgM","admitted hospital patients","serums","nucleic acid tests","diagnostic efficacy","key","pharyngeal swab specimens","diagnosis","real time RT-PCR","difference","Abstract","study"],"language":"en"},

Its definition appears somewhat ambiguous since angina is a symptom, whereas tonsillitis is due to a tonsil infection. The classification of angina is rather arbitrary, as angina presents various clinical aspects. Conversely, the same clinical aspects can also be due to different infectious agents. Clinical examination will define some aspects follows: erythematous angina of the oropharynx or erthematopultaceous tonsillitis, pseudomembranous, ulcerous and ulcero-necrotic or vesiculose angina. The etiology of angina is only partially understood and only very few studies have been reported. Viruses make up the main etiology. Group A streptococci is the main cause of angina. Group A streptococcus, particularly in children, is considered as a predominant factor, with a peak occuring between 5 and 10 years of age, while 30 % to 50 % of angina infections appear to be of viral origin in adults.

Accompanying MHV-1 infection we observe an increase in the number of neutrophils infiltrating the BAL and an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the lung draining lymph nodes of ps20\u2212/\u2212 compared with ps20\u002B/\u002B mice. Gene expression levels for the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2 are elevated in the lungs of ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice post-MHV-1 infection. Characterization of the immune cell profile in na\u00EFve ps20\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed an increase in circulating neutrophils compared to ps20\u002B/\u002B mice.

The cytokines secreted following inflammasome activation, which include IL-1 and IL-18, regulate cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system, guiding the subsequent immune responses. In this study we used murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection of the central nervous system and liver to assess of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines on pathogenesis and host defense during viral infection. Mice lacking all inflammasome signaling due to the absence of caspase-1 and -11 were more vulnerable to infection, with poor survival and elevated viral replication compared to wild type mice. Mice lacking IL-1 signaling experienced elevated viral replication but similar survival compared to wild type controls. In the absence of IL-18, mice had elevated viral replication and poor survival, and this protective effect of IL-18 was found to be due to promotion of interferon gamma production in \u03B1\u03B2 T cells.

Major advances in the study of the molecular biology of IBV have resulted from the development of reverse genetics systems for the highly attenuated, cell culture-adapted, IBV strain Beaudette. However, most IBV strains, amongst them virulent field isolates, can only be propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, and not in continuous cell lines. METHODS: We established a reverse genetics system for the IBV strain H52, based on targeted RNA recombination in a two-step process. First, a genomic and a chimeric synthetic, modified IBV RNA were co-transfected into non-susceptible cells to generate a recombinant chimeric murinized (m) IBV intermediate (mIBV). Herein, the genomic part coding for the spike glycoprotein ectodomain was replaced by that of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), allowing for the selection and propagation of recombinant mIBV in murine cells. In the second step, mIBV was used as the recipient. To this end a recombination with synthetic RNA comprising the 3\u2032-end of the IBV genome was performed by introducing the complete IBV spike gene, allowing for the rescue and selection of candidate recombinants in embryonated chicken eggs. RESULTS: Targeted RNA recombination allowed for the modification of the 3\u2032-end of the IBV genome, encoding all structural and accessory genes. A wild-type recombinant IBV was constructed, containing several synonymous marker mutations. The in ovo growth kinetics and in vivo characteristics of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental IBV strain H52. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted RNA recombination allows for the generation of recombinant IBV strains that are not able to infect and propagate in continuous cell lines. The ability to introduce specific mutations holds promise for the development of rationally designed live-attenuated IBV vaccines and for studies into the biology of IBV in general.

To guide vaccine policy decisions, we conducted a survey of laboratory workers to assess demand for HPAI vaccination. METHODS: We designed an anonymous web survey (EpiInfo 7.0) to collect information on demographics, type of work and time spent with HPAI viruses, and interest in HPAI vaccination. Eligible participants were identified from 42 entities registered with United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Select Agent program in 2016 and emailed electronic surveys.

One hundred respondents reported working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occurred with a mean time of 5.1\u201311.7 h per week. Overall, 49% were interested in receiving an A(H5N1) vaccine. By role, interest was highest among students (80%) and among those who spent \u003E50% of their time in a BSL-3E area (64%). Most (61%) of those who said they might be or were not interested in vaccine believed it would not provide additional protection to current safety practices. CONCLUSIONS: Half of responding laboratory workers was interested in receiving an influenza A(H5N1) vaccine. HPAI vaccination of laboratory workers at risk of occupational exposure could be used along with existing safety practices to protect this population.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Kate E.; Bresee, J.S.; Katz, J.M.; Olsen, S.J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f663de9a2ea65a8e0a356b0ad74de465208e0a78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5759037.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199043/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17315360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17315360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Immunization Practices","HPAI","United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Select Agent"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPAI vaccination of laboratory workers","HPAI viruses","HPAI experiments","laboratory personnel","survey of laboratory workers","BSL","laboratory access","H5N1","E area","vaccine policy decisions","Immunization Practices","current safety practices","existing safety practices","mean time","principal investigators","students","risk of occupational exposure","pathogenic avian influenza","licensed ASO3-adjuvanted influenza","anonymous web survey","Agent program","inter-pandemic periods","consideration of use","United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural","ACIP","data","persons","humans","entities","type of work","poultry","demand","research scientists","additional protection","technicians","information","EpiInfo","wild birds","Advisory Committee","demographics","Biosafety Level","emailed electronic surveys","postdoctoral fellows","BACKGROUND","responses","population","CONCLUSIONS","Half","estimated response rate","serious disease","Eligible participants","METHODS","role","Descriptive analysis","week","RESULTS","respondents"],"language":"en"},

Examples of such structures are viruses, some bacterial micro-compartments and eukaryotic vaults. Peptide/protein-based nanoparticles are emerging in synthetic biology for a variety of biomedical applications, mainly as drug targeting and delivery systems or as vaccines. Our self-assembling peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) are formed by a single peptide chain that consists of two helical coiled-coil segments connected by a short linker region. One helix is forming a pentameric coiled coil while the other is forming a trimeric coiled coil. RESULTS: Here, we were studying in vitro and in silico the effect of the chain length and of point mutations near the linker region between the pentamer and the trimer on the self-assembly of the SAPNs. 60 identical peptide chains co-assemble to form a spherical nanoparticle displaying icosahedral symmetry. We have stepwise reduced the size of the protein chain to a minimal chain length of 36 amino acids. We first used biochemical and biophysical methods on the longer constructs followed by molecular dynamics simulations to study eleven different smaller peptide constructs. We have identified one peptide that shows the most promising mini-nanoparticle model in silico. CONCLUSIONS: An approach of in silico modeling combined with in vitro testing and verification yielded promising peptide designs: at a minimal chain length of only 36 amino acids they were able to self-assemble into proper nanoparticles. This is important since the production cost increases more than linearly with chain length. Also the size of the nanoparticles is significantly smaller than 20 nm, thus reducing the immunogenicity of the particles, which in turn may allow to use the SAPNs as drug delivery systems without the risk of an anaphylactic shock.

In general, human rhinovirus was the most frequent among individuals from the community, and respiratory syncytial virus among hospitalized patients. Detection rates of other respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza viruses have been much lower. On the basis of an interference mechanism, human rhinovirus may contribute to modulate the pandemic wave, although available data are not conclusive to support this hypothesis. In contrast, the epidemic wave of respiratory syncytial virus during 2009\u20132010 was similar to previous seasons. Overall, incidence rates of respiratory viruses other than influenza did not change significantly during the pandemic season compared to other seasons. No association has been found between coinfection of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses with the prognosis of patients with influenza.

Moreover, it has been suggested that ER stress crosstalks with toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is the pathogen that causes Zika viral disease, and it is a mosquito-borne virus. However, its pathogenesis, especially the interaction between ZIKV and target cells during the early stages of infection, is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that infecting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with ZIKV triggers cellular autophagy. We observed both an increase in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and increased accumulation of fluorescent cells with LC3 dots, which are considered to be the two key indicators of autophagy. The ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH in each group was significantly increased at different times after ZIKV infection at different MOIs, indicating that the production of lipidated LC3-II increased. Moreover, both the ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH and the expression of viral NS3 protein increased with increasing time of viral infection. The expression level of p62 decreased gradually from 12 h post-infection. Expression profile of double fluorescent protein labelling LC3 indicated that the autophagy induced by ZIKV infection was a complete process. We further investigated the role of autophagy in ZIKV replication. We demonstrated that either the treatment with inhibitors of autophagosomes formation or short hairpin RNA targeting the Beclin-1 gene, which is critical for the formation of autophagosomes, significantly reduced viral production. Taken together, our results indicate that ZIKV infection induces autophagy of HUVEC, and inhibition of ZIKV-induced autophagy restrains viral replication.","publish_time":"2018-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Haoran; Liu, Bin; Yves, Toure Doueu; He, Yanhua; Wang, Shijie; Tang, Hailin; Ren, Hao; Zhao, Ping; Qi, Zhongtian; Qin, Zhaoling","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2e2beb6ce9597d9a4162f1399ed1a92cc010b66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5977252.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infection","ZIKV replication","autophagy of HUVEC","induced autophagy","ZIKV triggers cellular autophagy","inhibition of ZIKV","role of autophagy","viral replication","ratio of LC3","viral production","LC3 dots","conversion of LC3","increasing time of viral infection","key indicators of autophagy","production of lipidated LC3","expression of viral NS3 protein","Zika viral disease","early stages of infection","h post-infection","increased accumulation of fluorescent cells","Expression profile of double fluorescent protein labelling LC3","target cells","formation of autophagosomes","GAPDH","Zika virus","inhibitors of autophagosomes formation","expression level of p62","different times","different MOIs","human umbilical vein endothelial cells","short hairpin RNA","viruses","cell protection","Beclin","common strategy","interaction","turn","treatment","group","complete process","results","mosquito","pathogenesis","study"],"language":"en"},

The self-aggregating AA protein responsible for this disease is a byproduct of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein degradation. Transcriptional induction of the SAA1 gene is dependent on both C/EBP\u03B2 and NF-\u03BAB cis-acting elements within the promoter region. In cheetahs, 2 alleles exist for a single guanine nucleotide deletion in the putative NF-\u03BAB binding site. In this study, a novel genotyping assay was developed to screen for the alleles. The results show that the SAA1A(\u221297delG) allele is associated with decreased SAA protein concentrations in the serum of captive cheetahs (n = 58), suggesting genetic differences at this locus may be affecting AA amyloidosis prevalence. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the SAA1A(\u221297delG) allele between individuals confirmed AA amyloidosis positive versus AA amyloidosis negative at the time of necropsy (n = 48). Thus, even though there is evidence that having more copies of the SAA1A(\u221297delG) allele results in a potentially protective decrease in serum concentrations of SAA protein in captive cheetahs, genotype is not associated with this disease within the North American population. These results suggest that other factors are playing a more significant role in the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis among captive cheetahs.","publish_time":"2015-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franklin, Ashley D; Schmidt-K\u00FCntzel, Anne; Terio, Karen A; Marker, Laurie L; Crosier, Adrienne E","journal":"Journal of Heredity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6a4e5bb096c02107ee35adeda5d0b0137514ca7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5994965.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article-pdf/107/2/115/25024532/esv089.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AA amyloidosis negative","AA amyloidosis positive","pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis","AA amyloidosis prevalence","serum of captive cheetahs","serum concentrations of SAA protein","allele results","SAA1A","delG","self-aggregating AA protein responsible","decreased SAA protein concentrations","protein degradation","disease","byproduct of serum amyloid","alleles","significant role","significant difference","NF-\u03BAB cis-acting elements","putative NF-\u03BAB binding site","protective decrease","single guanine nucleotide deletion","individuals","major cause of morbidity","SAA1 gene","EBP\u03B2","mortality","locus","genotype","time of necropsy","novel genotyping assay","screen","Transcriptional induction","promoter region","study","North American population","frequency","factors","genetic differences","copies","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Adenovirus-derived vectors are also commonly chosen for gene therapy in human clinical trials. We have shown in previous work that homologous recombination between adenoviral genomes of human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), the largest and fastest growing HAdV species, is responsible for the rapid evolution of this species. Because adenovirus infection initiates in mucosal epithelia, particularly at the gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and ocular surfaces, we sought to determine a possible role for mucosal microbiota in adenovirus genome diversity. By analysis of known recombination hot spots across 38 human adenovirus genomes in species D (HAdV-D), we identified nucleotide sequence motifs similar to bacterial Chi sequences, which facilitate homologous recombination in the presence of bacterial Rec enzymes. These motifs, referred to here as Chi(AD), were identified immediately 5\u2032 to the sequence encoding penton base hypervariable loop 2, which expresses the arginine-glycine-aspartate moiety critical to adenoviral cellular entry. Coinfection with two HAdV-Ds in the presence of an Escherichia coli lysate increased recombination; this was blocked in a RecA mutant strain, E. coli DH5\u03B1, or upon RecA depletion. Recombination increased in the presence of E. coli lysate despite a general reduction in viral replication. RecA colocalized with viral DNA in HAdV-D-infected cell nuclei and was shown to bind specifically to Chi(AD) sequences. These results indicate that adenoviruses may repurpose bacterial recombination machinery, a sharing of evolutionary mechanisms across a diverse microbiota, and unique example of viral commensalism. IMPORTANCE Adenoviruses are common human mucosal pathogens of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and ocular surface. Here, we report finding Chi-like sequences in adenovirus recombination hot spots. Adenovirus coinfection in the presence of bacterial RecA protein facilitated homologous recombination between viruses. Genetic recombination led to evolution of an important external feature on the adenoviral capsid, namely, the penton base protein hypervariable loop 2, which contains the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif critical to viral internalization. We speculate that free Rec proteins present in gastrointestinal secretions upon bacterial cell death facilitate the evolution of human adenoviruses through homologous recombination, an example of viral commensalism and the complexity of virus-host interactions, including regional microbiota.","publish_time":"2018-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jeong Yoon; Lee, Ji Sun; Materne, Emma C.; Rajala, Rahul; Ismail, Ashrafali M.; Seto, Donald; Dyer, David W.; Rajaiya, Jaya; Chodosh, James","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9cd10250bab75a881cb23146ea83b8dee7bb302.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6010623.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozcz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chi","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homologous recombination","adenovirus recombination hot spots","Genetic recombination","bacterial recombination machinery","human adenovirus genomes","Adenovirus coinfection","adenoviral genomes of human adenovirus species D","Adenovirus infections","bacterial Chi sequences","presence of bacterial RecA protein","evolution of human adenoviruses","Escherichia coli lysate increased recombination","growing HAdV species","adenovirus genome diversity","adenovirus infection initiates","Adenovirus-derived vectors","analysis of known recombination hot spots","mucosal microbiota","presence of bacterial Rec enzymes","HAdV-Ds","viral internalization","viral DNA","viral replication","common human mucosal pathogens","bacterial cell death","unique example of viral commensalism","RecA depletion","human clinical trials","gastrointestinal secretions","adenoviral capsid","mucosal epithelia","diverse microbiota","coli DH5\u03B1","arginine-glycine","IMPORTANCE Adenoviruses","regional microbiota","rapid evolution","penton base protein hypervariable loop","penton base hypervariable loop","RecA mutant strain","adenoviral cellular entry","nucleotide sequence motifs similar","genitourinary tracts","ocular surfaces","aspartate moiety critical","infected cell nuclei","aspartic acid motif critical","free Rec proteins present","complexity of virus","sharing of evolutionary mechanisms","important external feature","host interactions","general reduction","gene therapy","possible role","previous work","humans","results"],"language":"en"},

Although IFITM3 induction occurs concomitantly with late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) cholesterol accumulation, the functional significance of this process is not well understood.

We demonstrate that inducing LE/L cholesterol accumulation is antiviral in non-IFN-primed cells, restricting incoming IAV particles and impairing mixing of IAV/endosomal membrane lipids.

In this study, we generated recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (rNDVs) expressing the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV using reverse genetics technology. Our results showed that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV provided better protection than the rNDV expressing S1 or S2 protein of IBV, indicating that the S protein is the best protective antigen of IBV.

Identifying where poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry might help the government better plan how to disseminate avian influenza prevention and control recommendations. METHODS: In order to identify where backyard poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry, we conducted in-depth and informal interviews: 70 with backyard poultry raisers and six with local poultry healthcare providers in two villages, and five with government veterinary professionals at the sub-district and union levels in two districts during June\u2013August 2009. RESULTS: Most (86% [60/70]) raisers sought care for their backyard poultry locally, 14% used home remedies only and none sought care from government veterinary professionals. The local poultry care providers provided advice and medications (n = 6). Four local care providers had shops in the village market where raisers sought healthcare for their poultry and the remaining two visited rural households to provide poultry healthcare services. Five of the six local care providers did not have formal training in veterinary medicine. Local care providers either did not know about avian influenza or considered avian influenza to be a disease common among commercial but not backyard poultry. The government professionals had degrees in veterinary medicine and experience with avian influenza and its prevention. They had their offices at the sub-district or union level and lacked staffing to reach the backyard raisers at the village level.

Binding to mucus decoy receptors and receptors on epithelial host cells is determined by a receptor-binding hemagglutinin (HA), a receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) and a complex in vivo receptor-repertoire. The crucial but poorly understood dynamics of these multivalent virus-receptor interactions cannot be properly analyzed using equilibrium binding models and endpoint binding assays. In this study, the use of biolayer interferometric analysis revealed the virtually irreversible nature of IAV binding to surfaces coated with synthetic sialosides or engineered sialoglycoproteins in the absence of NA activity. In addition to HA, NA was shown to be able to contribute to the initial binding rate while catalytically active. Virus-receptor binding in turn contributed to receptor cleavage by NA. Multiple low-affinity HA-SIA interactions resulted in overall extremely high avidity but also permitted a dynamic binding mode, in which NA activity was driving rolling of virus particles over the receptor-surface. Virus dissociation only took place after receptor density of the complete receptor-surface was sufficiently decreased due to NA activity of rolling IAV particles. The results indicate that in vivo IAV particles, after landing on the mucus layer, reside continuously in a receptor-bound state while rolling through the mucus layer and over epithelial cell surfaces driven by the HA-NA-receptor balance. Quantitative BLI analysis enabled functional examination of this balance which governs this dynamic and motile interaction that is expected to be crucial for penetration of the mucus layer and subsequent infection of cells by IAV but likely also by other enveloped viruses carrying a receptor-destroying enzyme in addition to a receptor-binding protein.","publish_time":"2018-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Hongbo; Rabouw, Huib; Slomp, Anne; Dai, Meiling; van der Vegt, Floor; van Lent, Jan W.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms in a Singaporean pediatrics hospital. Upon consent, residual respiratory samples from pediatric inpatients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were collected and further screened for WU and KI using qPCR. The amplicons of positive samples were sequenced for confirmation. The severity of a patient\u0027s illness was assessed by chart review post-discharge looking for clinical markers of respiratory status such as presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and interventions. Results: From December 2016 to April 2017, 201 patients with residual respiratory samples were enrolled in the study. The average age of all participants recruited was 45 months. WU and KI were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients, respectively. Conducting bivariate and multivariate modeling, patients with WU or KI positivity were not at increased risk of SARI, need for additional oxygen, intravenous fluids, and did not receive additional oral antibiotics or bronchodilators during admission. In contrast, patients with RSV detections were at increased risk of requiring supplemental oxygen during hospital admission.

The etiology of this disease is not known. We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities. In this study, we screened egg layer flocks, in the provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), with and without a history of SES for the presence of IBV infection. During 2015\u20132016, a total of 27 egg layer flocks were screened in AB (n = 7) and SK (n = 20). Eighty-one percent of the screened flocks (n = 22) were positive for IBV infection. Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types. Since the majority of the IBV isolates included within the Mass type, we used a Mass type IBV isolate to reproduce SES in specific pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens in lay. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether other IBV isolates can cause SES, to clarify the pathogenesis of SES and to develop a vaccine in order to prevent SES as observed in Western Canadian layer flocks.","publish_time":"2018-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amarasinghe, Aruna; Popowich, Shelly; De Silva Senapathi, Upasama; Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; Marshall, Frank; van der Meer, Frank; Cork, Susan C.; Gomis, Susantha; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb5d7caba7ff8afec3c1fde62cadf65db745ce35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6116215.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6116215/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Conn"],"organizations":["SES","IBV","SK"],"locations":["Alberta"],"keyphrases":["IBV isolates","Mass type IBV","IBV replicates","history of SES","pathogenesis of SES","presence of IBV infection","screened flocks","Western Canada egg layer flocks","egg production","egg syndrome","Western Canadian layer flocks","shell gland","genetic characteristics of Mass","study","disease","majority","Conn types","partial S1 gene variability","SPF","specific pathogen free","uncharacterized genotype","white leghorn chickens","variable spike","genotypes","sudden drop","strain","infectious bronchitis virus","provinces of Alberta","various eggshell abnormalities","molecular tools","rest","Saskatchewan","Connecticut","vaccine","percent","Massachusetts","total","order","etiology","studies"],"language":"en"},

However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Qiang-Hua; Deng, Chuang-Zhong; Chen, Jie-Ping; Huang, Kang-Bo; Liu, Ting-Yu; Yao, Kai; Liu, Zhuo-Wei; Qin, Zi-Ke; Li, Yong-Hong; Guo, Sheng-Jie; Ye, Yun-Lin; Zhou, Fang-Jian; Huang, Wenlin; Liu, Ran-Yi; Han, Hui","journal":"Cancer Manag Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd2dac1db0e974c27b6b7b5a17aaab35fc8d36c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6118283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6118283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSCC","LN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PSCC tissues","stage PSCC patients","LN metastasis of PSCC cells","LAMC2 expression level","PSCC cell migration","level of sLAMC2","serum LAMC2","Upregulated LAMC2","Elevated LAMC2 levels","mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells","primary cancer tissues","stage penile cancer","sLAMC2 concentration","survival analysis","predictive value of sLAMC2","early penile cancer","cancer diagnosis","penile squamous cell carcinoma","stratification analysis","prediction of survival","higher predictive value","shorter disease-specific survival","squamous cell carcinoma antigen","valuable prognostic factors","serologic factors","Meier analysis","nude mice","invasion","log-rank test","chi-squared test","potential serologic prognostic marker","suitable prognostic factor","clinical parameters","risk stratification","advanced clinicopathologic parameters","metastatic lymph node","Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction","C-reactive protein","Western blotting","Kaplan","Cox proportional hazards regression model","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","death","immunohistochemistry","association","Transwell assay","Molecular biomarkers","experiment","laminin gamma","study","hazard ratio","PURPOSE","patient follow-up","findings","METHODS","authors","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Despite a large body of evidence supporting mutagenesis as a conceivable antiviral strategy, there are currently no data on the sensitivity to increased mutagenesis for Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two emerging flaviviral threats. In this study, we demonstrate that both viruses are sensitive to three ribonucleosides, favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil, that have shown mutagenic activity against other RNA viruses while remaining unaffected by a mutagenic deoxyribonucleoside. Serial cell culture passages of ZIKV in the presence of these compounds resulted in the rapid extinction of infectivity, suggesting elevated sensitivity to mutagenesis. USUV extinction was achieved when a 10-fold dilution was applied between every passage, but not in experiments involving undiluted virus, indicating an overall lower susceptibility than ZIKV. Although the two viruses are inhibited by the same three drugs, ZIKV is relatively more susceptive to serial passage in the presence of purine analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin), while USUV replication is suppressed more efficiently by 5-fluorouracil. These differences in sensitivity typically correlate with the increases in the mutation frequencies observed in each nucleoside treatment. These results are relevant to the development of efficient therapies based on lethal mutagenesis and support the rational selection of different mutagenic nucleosides for each pathogen. We will discuss the implications of these results to the fidelity of flavivirus replication and the design of antiviral therapies based on lethal mutagenesis.","publish_time":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Sempere, Raquel Navarro; Meyn, Prashansa; Polacek, Charlotta; Arias, Armando","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/161f78640afedeaf77c5994e593871a71ee00c8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6125542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USUV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lethal mutagenesis","USUV replication","USUV extinction","Usutu virus","Zika virus","undiluted virus","serial passage","mutagenic activity","favipiravir","ribavirin","elevated sensitivity","mutagenic deoxyribonucleoside","results","RNA viruses","fluorouracil","Serial cell culture passages of ZIKV","design of antiviral therapies","rational selection of different mutagenic nucleosides","presence of purine analogues","development of efficient therapies","fidelity of flavivirus replication","conceivable antiviral strategy","rapid extinction of infectivity","disease","growing numbers of pathogens","increasing source of public health concern","geographic spread","overall lower susceptibility","mutation frequencies","temperate climates","ribonucleosides","compounds","large body of evidence","emerging flaviviral threats","nucleoside treatment","Flaviviruses","increases","experiments","data","fold dilution","implications","drugs","study","differences"],"language":"en"},

The number of protein structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. RESULTS: Focusing on the \u03B1-helical coiled coils, which are ubiquitous protein-structure and protein\u2013protein interaction motifs, we present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies. iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called \u03B1-helical barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented alongside a partial enumeration of the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of coiled-coil structures; i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket). This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein graphs.

The discovery of new antivirals is a good approach to control new outbreaks that cause such death. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity against Measles virus (MeV) of Polyphenol-rich extracts (PPs) coming from five seaweeds collected and cultivated in Mexico. An MTT assay was performed to determine cytotoxicity effect, and antiviral activity was measured by syncytia reduction assay and confirmed by qPCR. PPs from Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea, Phaeophyceae) and Solieria filiformis (Rhodophyta) showed the highest Selectivity Index (SI), \u003E3750 and \u003E576.9 respectively. Both PPs extracts were selected to the subsequent experiments owing to their high efficacy and low cytotoxicity compared with ribavirin (SI of 11.57). The combinational effect of PPs with sulphated polysaccharides (SPs) and ribavirin were calculated by using Compusyn software. Synergistic activity was observed by combining both PPs with low concentrations of Solieria filiformis SPs (0.01 \u00B5g/mL). The antiviral activity of the best combinations was confirmed by qPCR. Virucidal assay, time of addition, and viral penetration evaluations suggested that PPs act mainly by inactivating the viral particle.

Most childhood deaths in hospital often occur within the first 24 h of admission. Many of these deaths are from preventable causes. This study aims to describe the patterns of mortality in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: This was a five-year chart review of deaths in pediatric patients aged 7 days to 13 years presenting to the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Tertiary Hospital (TASTH) from January 2012 to December 2016. Data were collected using a pretested, structured checklist, and analyzed using the SPSS Version 20. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression was carried out to estimate any measures of association between variables of interest and the primary outcome of death. RESULTS: The proportion of pediatric emergency department (PED) deaths was 4.1% (499 patients) out of 12,240 PED presentations. This translates to a mortality rate of 8.2 deaths per 1000 patients per year. The three top causes of deaths were pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) and sepsis. Thirty two percent of the deaths occurred within 24 h of presentation with 6.5% of the deaths being neonates and the most common co-morbid illness was malnutrition (41.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed that shortness of breath [AOR=2.45, 95% CI (1.22-4.91)], late onset of signs and symptoms [AOR=3.22, 95% CI (1.34-7.73)], fever [AOR=3.17, 95% CI (1.28-7.86)], and diarrhea [AOR=3.36, 95% CI (1.69-6.67)] had significant association with early mortality. CONCLUSION: The incidence of pediatric emergency mortality was high in our study. A delay in presentation of more than 48 hours, diarrheal diseases and shortness of breath were significantly associated with early pediatric mortality. Early identification and intervention are required to reduce pediatric emergency mortality.","publish_time":"2018-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jofiro, Gemechu; Jemal, Kemal; Beza, Lemlem; Bacha Heye, Tigist","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b2c75b7d91b9790cde7b3148a395c177c3cd665.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6167843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tikur Anbessa Specialized","PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early pediatric mortality","childhood deaths","causes of deaths","early mortality","pediatric patients","incidence of pediatric emergency mortality","Childhood mortality","patterns of mortality","mortality rate","AOR","proportion of pediatric emergency department","five-year chart review of deaths","shortness of breath","Multivariate analysis","Early identification","h of presentation","study","Tertiary Hospital","PED presentations","significant association","measures of association","preventable causes","h of admission","congestive heart failure","pneumonia","CHF","common co-morbid illness","Tikur Anbessa","symptoms","resource","children","malnutrition","variables","TASTH","years","hours","diarrheal diseases","neonates","intervention","days","late onset of signs","sepsis","logistic regression","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","primary outcome of death","structured checklist","world countries","METHODS","fever","SPSS Version","Data","delay","percent"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, based on similarity index analysis, codon adaptation index analysis and relative codon deoptimization index analysis, we found that PCV3 might pose a potential risk to public health though with unknow pathogenicity.

Evaluated responses included phagocytosis, bacteria-killing, gene expression of cell surface molecules (cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), CD80, CD83, and CD197) and antimicrobial effectors (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX-1), interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3), LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 factor (LITAF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10), and production of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). RESULTS: GA increased the internalization of both fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and ST by HD11 cells and markedly decreased the intracellular survival of ST. We found that the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell surface molecules (CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD197) and cytokines (IFN-\u03B3, IL-6, and IL-10) of HD11 cells was up-regulated following GA exposure. The expression of iNOS and NOX-1 was induced by GA and thereby the productions of NO and H(2)O(2) in HD11 cells were enhanced. Notably, it was verified that nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways were responsible for GA-induced synthesis of NO and IFN-\u03B3 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggested that GA exhibits a potent immune regulatory effect to activate chicken macrophages and enhances Salmonella-killing capacity.

To identify molecular signatures of sALS we performed genome-wide expression profiling in laser capture microdissection-enriched surviving motor neurons (MNs) from lumbar spinal cords of sALS patients with rostral onset and caudal progression. After correcting for immunological background, we discover a highly specific gene expression signature for sALS that is associated with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) pathology. Transcriptome\u2013pathology correlation identified casein kinase 1\u03B5 (CSNK1E) mRNA as tightly correlated to levels of pTDP-43 in sALS patients. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation in human sALS patient- and healthy control-derived frontal cortex, revealed that TDP-43 binds directly to and regulates the expression of CSNK1E mRNA. Additionally, we were able to show that pTDP-43 itself binds RNA. CK1E, the protein product of CSNK1E, in turn interacts with TDP-43 and promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of pTDP-43 in human stem-cell-derived MNs. Pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation is therefore, reciprocally regulated by CK1E activity and TDP-43 RNA binding. Our framework of transcriptome\u2013pathology correlations identifies candidate genes with relevance to novel mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

The herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) vaccine is one of the most widely used MD vaccines in poultry industry. Vaccines can be adjuvanted with Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-Ls) to enhance their efficacy. In this study, we examined whether combining TLR-Ls with HVT can boost host immunity against MD and improve its efficacy.

The virus circulates as many different types (168), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. In total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species A, B and C, respectively. HRV types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. Spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks. Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.","publish_time":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morobe, John Mwita; Nyiro, Joyce U.; Brand, Samuel; Kamau, Everlyn; Gicheru, Elijah; Eyase, Fredrick; Otieno, Grieven P.; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Agoti, C.N.; Nokes, D.J.","journal":"Wellcome Open Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d05dbf38f98918269d71020f0c9ff616548c2df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6234744.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Demographic Surveillance System","HRV","NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV types","HRV species","clustering of types","identical types","transmission patterns of HRV","evidence of similar types","HRV type spatial distribution","high prevalence of HRV","close health facilities","type partitioning","independent community invasion of different types","Spatial patterns","high type diversity","patient facilities","Patterns of occurrence","type-specific population immunity","heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence","significant public health burden","significant evidence","positive samples","NPS samples","clinical features of ARI","Temporal differences of persistence","close proximity","road systems","patient presentations","rapid spread","Demographic characteristics","similar times","local spread","major road networks","Demographic Surveillance System","symptoms of acute respiratory infection","predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections","patients","variation","VP2 genomic region","VP4","G-test statistic","wide distance","multiple invasions","Classification models","study","real-time RT-PCR","Nasopharyngeal swabs","Human rhinovirus","Background","influence","Methods","Conclusion","Results","Phylogenetic analysis","total"],"language":"en"},

Attachment of virus-derived nuclear localization sequences facilitates nuclear entry of DNA. Improvements in DNA vaccine design include the use of APC-specific promotors for transcriptional targeting, the arrangement of multiple antigen sequences, the co-delivery of molecular adjuvants to prevent tolerance induction, and strategies to circumvent potential inhibitory effects of the vector backbone.

Using this strategy, picornaviruses can evade the host immune response and replicate inside host cells.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yining; Ma, Lina; Stipkovits, Laszlo; Szathmary, Susan; Li, Xuerui; Liu, Yongsheng","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f72c004e5517cc9cf54b882cb1b817f21cce515c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6297142.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6297142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cells","host immune response","brief overview of host","host antiviral responses","pathways","strategy","picornavirus non-structural proteins","IFN production","inhibition of IFN","effects of IFNs","innate immune system","Co-evolution of viruses","hosts","suppression","important role","development of various strategies","Viral infections","interferons","picornaviruses","review"],"language":"en"},

Infected patients frequently present with pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome with high rates of intensive care unit admission and death. Neurological complications, such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome(GBS), and intensive care unit-acquired weakness, including critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy, have only rarely been reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we report on two Chinese patients with H7N9 severe pneumonia presenting neurological complications. These two patients had non-immune diseases prior to the onset of virus infection. A 56-year-old female patient (case 1) and a 78-year-old female patient (case 2) were admitted because of fever, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath. These patients were confirmed to have H7N9 infection soon after admission followed by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and various severe bacterial and fungal infections. The case 1 patient was found to have muscle weakness in all extremities after withdrawing the mechanical ventilator, and the case 2 patient was found when withdrawing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, both of these conditions prolonged ventilator-weaning time. Furthermore, the case 1 patient carried the H7N9 virus for a prolonged period, reaching 28 days, and both of them stayed in the hospital for more than two months. A clinical diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness could be confirmed. However, based on results from electrophysiological testing and needle electromyography of these 2 patients, it is difficult to differentiate critical illness polyneuropathy from GBS, since no lumbar puncture or muscle and nerve biopsy were conducted during hospitalization. Following a long-term comprehensive treatment, the patients\u2019 neurological condition improved gradually. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is great improvement in saving severe patients\u2019 lives from fatal respiratory and blood infections, it is necessary to pay sufficient attention and to use more methods to differentiate GBS from intensive care unit-acquired weakness. This unusual neurological complication could result in additional complications including ventilator associated pneumonia, prolonged hospital stay and then would further increase the death rate, and huge costs.","publish_time":"2018-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Chao-Nan; Tang, Ling-Ling","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6eb78fc0c66c0840cd32152d7d612106d01c993f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6302428.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6302428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus","Neurological complications","CASE PRESENTATION","H7N9 severe pneumonia","GBS","H7N9 infection","Chinese patients","muscle weakness","Infected patients","year-old female patient","clinical diagnosis of intensive care unit","high rates of intensive care unit admission","prolonged hospital","patients\u2019 neurological condition","acute respiratory disorder syndrome","development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe patients\u2019 lives","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","additional complications","onset of virus infection","critical illness polyneuropathy","prolonged period","mechanical ventilator","unusual neurological complication","conditions prolonged ventilator-weaning time","blood infections","fungal infections","death rate","emerging avian influenza","subtype of influenza viruses","lumbar puncture","chest tightness","nerve biopsy","needle electromyography","great improvement","non-immune diseases","methods","Guillain","long-term comprehensive treatment","cough","results","electrophysiological testing","fever","extremities","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","shortness of breath","sufficient attention","huge costs","BACKGROUND","study","myopathy","hospitalization","CONCLUSIONS","days","months","China"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we report our experience with the use of NIV in mild to moderate ARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study involving consecutive subjects of ARDS treated with NIV using an oronasal mask. Patients were monitored clinically with serial arterial blood gas analysis. The success of NIV, duration of NIV use, Intensive Care Unit stay, hospital mortality, and improvement in clinical and blood gas parameters were assessed. The success of NIV was defined as prevention of endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: A total of 41 subjects (27 women, mean age: 30.9 years) were included in the study. Tropical infections followed by abdominal sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS. The use of NIV was successful in 18 (44%) subjects, while 23 subjects required intubation. The median time to intubation was 3 h. Overall, 19 (46.3%) deaths were encountered, all in those requiring invasive ventilation. The mean duration of ventilation was significantly higher in the intubated patients (7.1 vs. 2.6 days, P = 0.004). Univariate analysis revealed a lack of improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 1 h and high baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) as predictors of NIV failure. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NIV in mild to moderate ARDS helped in avoiding intubation in about 44% of the subjects.

They are thus in constant natural contact with humans and animals. However, the clinical and technological use of bacteriophages has also become more frequent, which is why all aspects of phage\u2013mammal interactions need to be explored. Bacteriophages are able to interact with mammalian phagocytes. They may inhibit the phagocytosis of bacteria, but they may also undergo phagocytosis themselves. The ability of bacteriophages to reduce reactive oxygen species production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of bacteria or their endotoxins was also confirmed. Studies show that the high immunogenicity of bacteriophages may also be employed in anti-tumor treatment. The present knowledge of phage interactions with cellular components of the mammalian immune system is sparse and insufficient, especially considering the increasing interest in the application of these viruses in human life.

However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3\u0027 coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses.

METHODS A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSION Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michelena, Xabier; Borrell, Helena; L\u00F3pez-Corbeto, Mireia; L\u00F3pez-Lasanta, Mar\u00EDa; Moreno, Estefan\u00EDa; Pascual-Pastor, Mar\u00EDa; Erra, Alba; Serrat, Mayte; Espartal, Esther; Ant\u00F3n, Susana; A\u00F1ez, Gustavo Adolfo; Caparr\u00F3s-Ruiz, Raquel; Pluma, Andrea; Trallero-Aragu\u00E1s, Ernesto; Barcel\u00F3-Bru, Mireia; Almirall, Miriam; De Agust\u00EDn, Juan Jos\u00E9; Segura, Jordi Llad\u00F3s; Juli\u00E0, Antonio; Marsal, Sara","journal":"Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bd7744e1fc4a121de2f9161a459cbf33d57f5ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425260/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017220301311?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049017220301311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["rheumatic diseases","incidence of COVID","paediatric patients","cohort of adult","adult cohort","paediatric cohort","rheumatic patient cohort","confirmed positive cases","governmental COVID","tDMARDs proportions","non-suspected cases","Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases","anti-rheumatic drugs","clinical expression of COVID","higher risk of COVID","CONCLUSION Adult","general population","confirmed SARS-CoV","synthetic disease","disease activity","incidence rates","severe disease outcome","positive PCR test","related symptoms","health database","compatible symptoms","electronic health records review","targeted biologic","telephone survey","large rheumatology tertiary centre","Barcelona","contact history data","treatments","cross-sectional study","Spain","criteria","city districts","significant differences","start","possible effect","Demographics","RESULTS","ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES","METHODS","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods We included infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis from 2004 to 2014. All infants underwent a nasal washing for virus detection. A regional agency network collected meteorological data (mean temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and the following air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 \u00B5m (PM10) and less than 2.5 \u00B5m (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child\u0027s home address. Overdispersed Poisson regression model was fitted and adjusted for seasonality of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, to evaluate the impact of individual characteristics and environmental factors on the probability of a being positive RSV. Results Of the 723 nasal washings from the infants enrolled, 266 (68%) contained RSV, 63 (16.1%) rhinovirus, 26 (6.6%) human bocavirus, 20 (5.1%) human metapneumovirus, and 16 (2.2%) other viruses. The number of RSV-positive infants correlated negatively with temperature (p \u003C 0.001), and positively with relative humidity (p \u003C 0.001).

The notification was based on a serological diagnosis in a small farm with a morbidity rate of 2.3% without enteric clinical signs. In order to determine if TGEV was circulating before the official report, a retrospective study on cases of neonatal diarrhea was performed. The selection criteria was a sudden increase in mortality in 1- to 21-day-old piglets with watery diarrhea that did not respond to antibiotics. Based on these criteria, three clinical cases were identified during 2010\u20132015. RESULTS: All animals that were evaluated presented histological lesions consistent with enteric viral infection. The feces and ultrathin sections of intestine that were evaluated by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of round particles of approximately 80 nm in size and characterized by finely granular electrodense nucleoids consistent with complete particles of coronavirus. The presence of the TGEV antigen was confirmed by monoclonal specific immunohistochemistry, and final confirmation of a metabolically-active virus was performed by in situ hybridization to detect a TGE mRNA encoding spike protein. All sections evaluated in this case were negative for PEDV and rotavirus A. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case series describing neonatal mortality with etiological confirmation of TGEV in Argentina. The clinical diagnosis of TGEV infections in endemic regions is challenging due to the epidemiological distribution and coinfection with other enteric pathogens that mask the clinical presentation.

To assess the distribution of AvRVs in chickens and turkeys, we have developed specific PCR protocols. These protocols were applied in two field studies investigating faecal samples or intestinal contents of diseased birds derived from several European countries and Bangladesh. In the first study, samples of 166 chickens and 33 turkeys collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by PAGE and conventional RT-PCR and AvRVs were detected in 46.2%. In detail, 16.1% and 39.2% were positive for AvRVs of groups A or D, respectively. 11.1% of the samples contained both of them and only four samples (2.0%) contained rotaviruses showing a PAGE pattern typical for groups F and G. In the second study, samples from 375 chickens and 18 turkeys collected between 2009 and 2010 were analyzed using a more sensitive group A-specific and a new group D-specific real-time RT-PCR. In this survey, 85.0% were AvRV-positive, 58.8% for group A AvRVs, 65.9% for group D AvRVs and 38.9% for both of them. Although geographical differences exist, the results generally indicate a very high prevalence of group A and D rotaviruses in chicken and turkey flocks with cases of diarrhoea, growth retardation or RSS.

Data analysis using percent agreement, kappa, and prevalence\u2010adjusted and bias\u2010adjusted kappa (PABAK) values was performed for comparisons among the three RV assays. RESULTS: Of the 201 samples, AP, AD, and RQ detected 105 (52.2%), 99 (49.3%), and 95 (47.3%) positive cases respectively. The overall agreement, kappa, and PABAK values for the three assays ranged between 97%\u201098%, 0.76\u20100.86, and 0.93\u20100.96 respectively.

The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pennisi, Maria-Grazia; Cardoso, Lu\u00EDs; Baneth, Gad; Bourdeau, Patrick; Koutinas, Alek; Mir\u00F3, Guadalupe; Oliva, Gaetano; Solano-Gallego, Laia","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2405180506967da1f4007e49ad653c3c356a823a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4462189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041555/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0909-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Meglumine"],"organizations":["IHC","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical illness","clinical experience","clinical manifestations","common clinical signs","infantum infection","clinical signs compatible","feline leishmaniosis","prevention of clinical relapses","PCR","prevention of infection","diagnosis of leishmaniosis","Follow-up of treated cats","nodular lesions","prevalence rates of feline infection","common treatment","Leishmania infantum","skin lesions","ocular lesions","cytology","serology","histology","canine leishmaniosis","subclinical feline infections","based studies","IHC","recommendations","culture","feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome","molecular-based surveys","case reports","nodular dermatitis","serological testing","immunosuppressive therapy","consensus of opinions","secondary reservoir","clinicopathological abnormalities compatible","case of retroviral coinfections","comprehensive review of evidence","critical consensus discussions","primary natural reservoir","hypergammaglobulinaemia","areas endemic","lymph node enlargement","routine laboratory tests","low positive","uveitis","monitoring","current knowledge","mild normocytic normochromic anaemia","head","dogs","polymerase chain reaction","epidemiological role","prognosis","additional diagnostic methods","distal limbs","impaired immunocompetence","immunohistochemistry","Limited data","Specific preventative measures","management","sand flies","order","LeishVet group","disease","allopurinol","Meglumine antimoniate","reported cases","drugs"],"language":"en"},

The results indicate that the use of Bokashi as feed additives resulted in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6, which increase the protective capacity of the colostrum by stimulating cellular immune mechanisms protecting the sow and neonates against infection. At the same time, the increased concentrations of cytokines IL-4, IL-10, TGF-\u03B2, and of immunoglobulins in the colostrum and milk from sows in the experimental group demonstrate the immunoregulatory effect of Bokashi on Th2 cells and may lead to increased expression of regulatory T cells and polarization of the immune response from Th1 to Th2.","publish_time":"2018-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laskowska, Ewa; Jarosz, \u0141ukasz; Gr\u0105dzki, Zbigniew","journal":"Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5a2d3550cfa6c07e3a376f03ce1cc135f87afe4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6449489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305686/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12602-017-9380-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EM Bokashi"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of colostrum","serum of sows","milk samples","increased concentrations of cytokines IL","use of Bokashi","study","Th2 cells","EM Bokashi","immunoregulatory effect of Bokashi","effect of Bokashi formulation","increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1","anti-inflammatory cytokines","pregnancy","Blood samples","increased expression of regulatory T cells","stimulated polymorphonuclear cells","immune response","feed additives","use of probiotics","peripheral blood","sows\u2019 feed","cellular immune mechanisms","polarization","experimental group","lactation","offspring","neonates","Th1","impact","PMNs","immunoglobulins","rearing period","health conditions","TGF-\u03B2","time","protective capacity","infection","material","culture","days","results","attention of researchers","parturition","gestation","aim","years"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we identified amino acid residue in MERS-CoV nsp1 that differ from those of SARS-CoV nsp1, and that appear to be crucial for circumventing the translational shutoff. In addition, reverse genetics analysis suggested the presence of a cis-acting element at the 5\u2032-terminus of the nsp1-coding region, which contributes to the specific recognition of viral RNA that is required for an efficient viral replication.

The cutaneous lesions, caused by the virus, spread to the nervous system creating several complications. Fusion of host membranes with the viral envelope is mandatory and mediated by a group of glycoproteins conserved in all Herpesviridae subfamilies, such as the glycoproteins B (gB), H (gH), L (gL) and D (gD). We investigated the inhibitory activity mediated by synthetic overlapping peptides spanning the entire ectodomains of gH and gL glycoproteins. We have performed a brute analysis of the complete gH/gL heterodimer in order to explore the inhibitory activity of peptides modelled on these glycoproteins against HSV\u20101 infection. Twenty\u2010four of the gH peptides at a concentration of 150 \u03BCM reached the 50% of inhibition cut\u2010off. Interestingly, they are mainly located in the gH carboxy\u2010terminal domain. None of the gL peptides had a clear inhibiting effect. No peptide toxicity was observed by lactate dehydrogenase assay at the concentrations used in our experimental conditions. HSV\u20101 therapy is based on acyclovir treatment, but some resistant strains are emerging. In this scenario, innovative approaches for HSV\u20101 treatment are necessary.

Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans. Therefore, we aimed to identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations. We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world. Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against pre-specified eligibility criteria. We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques. We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care; from the World Health Organization (n=3), and eight individual countries: USA (n=7), the Netherlands (n=2), Ireland (n=1), United Kingdom (n=3), Switzerland (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), Belgium (n=1). International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care related topics. Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers). There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes. Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made. Key aspects of palliative care, i.e. symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joni, Gilissen; Lara, Pivodic; Unroe Kathleen, T.; Lieve, Van den Block","journal":"J Pain Symptom Manage","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/caffccbde317bff0d916aaee8ea056a7d4fe6213.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211580.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420303729?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420303729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437942/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","United Kingdom"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["life care","Comprehensive palliative care","Palliative care themes","palliative care related topics","Key aspects of palliative care","nursing homes","guidance documents","International documents","advance care planning documentation","end of life","global COVID","adapted COVID","eligible documents","dearth of comprehensive international COVID","life visits","high-quality end","family support","thematic analysis","content analysis","breadth of topics","World Health Organization","clinical decision-making","symptom management","referral","specialist services","staff education","greater attention","hospice","government bodies","enormous pressures","sentences","narrative synthesis techniques","infection prevention","pre-specified eligibility criteria","future guidelines","expert consultation","response plans","professional associations","control","directed documentary","limited focus","individual countries","USA","review","United Kingdom","New Zealand","mortality","hospital transfers","recommendations","Netherlands","Ireland","Switzerland","Belgium"],"language":"en"},

Since pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there is a dearth of evidence addressing the following questions: (i) Have the resources invested in strategic and routine communication for past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health preparedness benefits? (ii) Have past efforts sensitized people to pay attention to new pandemic threats? The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was followed closely by major media outlets in the USA provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between exposure to public communication about epidemics and public awareness and knowledge about new risks. METHODS: In December, 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 627 American adults and examined the associations between people\u0027s awareness to prior pandemics and their awareness of and knowledge about MERS. RESULTS: Awareness of prior pandemics was significantly associated with awareness and knowledge of MERS. The most common sources from which people first heard about MERS were also identified.

The name mucosa comes from mucus, a dense fluid enriched in glycoproteins, such as mucin, which main function is to protect the delicate mucosal epithelium. Mucus provides a barrier against physiological chemical and physical aggressors (i.e., host secreted digestive products such as bile acids and enzymes, food particles) but also against the potentially noxious microbiota and their products. Intestinal mucosa covers 400m2 in the human host, and, as a consequence, is the major portal of entry of the majority of known pathogens. But, in turn, some microorganisms have evolved many different approaches to circumvent this barrier, a direct consequence of natural co-evolution. The understanding of these mechanisms (known as virulence factors) used to interact and/or disrupt mucosal barriers should instruct us to a rational design of nanoparticulate delivery systems intended for oral vaccination and immunotherapy. This review deals with this mimetic approach to obtain nanocarriers capable to reach the epithelial cells after oral delivery and, in parallel, induce strong and long-lasting immune and protective responses.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gamazo, Carlos; Mart\u00EDn-Arbella, Nekane; Brotons, Ana; Camacho, Ana I.; Irache, J.

The aim of this article was to determine the prevalence and impact of virus and bacterial infections in acute asthma and COPD. METHODS: Subjects were recruited, within 24 h of hospital admission for acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Nose/throat swabs and sputum samples were collected and examined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses and cultured for bacteria. The primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and readmission to hospital within 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 199 subjects were recruited (96 had asthma and 103 COPD) for 235 events (36 re\u2010presented). A virus was detected in 79 subjects (40%), bacteria in 41 (21%), and of these, 18 had both. Rhinovirus A was the most frequently isolated virus. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for confounders. It found that detection of a virus, a virus and bacteria, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and a diagnosis of COPD were all independent predictors of prolonged LOS, while risk of readmission within 60 days was increased with virus infection alone, virus and bacterial infection, lower FEV(1) and current smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Virus infection, especially in the presence of chronic bacterial infection, is an important determinant of more severe acute exacerbations in both asthma and COPD, and patients with co\u2010infections are more likely to be readmitted to hospital following their exacerbation.","publish_time":"2013-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wark, Peter A.B.; Tooze, Melinda; Powell, Heather; Parsons, Kristy","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d33ad5a9ab34ba3e5f0c02273f195ed84882e801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169161.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23600594/; https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12099","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","acute asthma","impact of virus","isolated virus","acute exacerbations of asthma","diagnosis of COPD","Subjects","presence of chronic bacterial infection","bacterial infections","severe acute exacerbations","days","h of hospital admission","important determinant","important trigger","lower FEV","co\u2010infections","risk of readmission","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","independent predictors of prolonged LOS","respiratory viruses","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","expiratory volume","patients","sputum samples","length of stay","Nose","throat swabs","prevalence","primary outcomes","control","OBJECTIVE","multivariate analysis","current smoking","confounders","article","RESULTS","total","BACKGROUND","events","CONCLUSIONS","detection","aim","Rhinovirus","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

More recently, however, growing human populations, technological elaborations and the emergence of a booming commercial bushmeat trade have culminated in unprecedented harvest rates and the consequent decline of numerous wildlife populations. Most research efforts aimed at tackling this problem to date have been rooted in the biological disciplines, focused on quantifying the trade and measuring its level of destruction on wildlife and ecosystems. Comparatively little effort, on the other hand, has been expended on illuminating the role of bushmeat in human livelihoods and in providing alternative sources of food and income, as well as the infrastructure to make these feasible. This paper aims to shift the focus to the human dimension, emphasising the true contributions of bushmeat to food security, nutrition and well-being, while balancing this perspective by considering the far-reaching impacts of overexploitation. What emerges from this synthesis is that bushmeat management will ultimately depend on understanding and working with people, with any approaches focused too narrowly on biodiversity preservation running the risk of failure in the long term. If wildlife is to survive and be utilised in the future, there is undoubtedly a need to relax adherence to unswerving biocentric or anthropocentric convictions, to appreciate the necessity for certain trade-offs and to develop integrated and flexible approaches that reconcile the requirements of both the animals and the people.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cawthorn, Donna-Mare\u00E8; Hoffman, Louwrens C.","journal":"Food Research International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac9966dc2096f3b75327f7a3ba297d93d8a5ef8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126303.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996915001301; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0963996915001301","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Latin America","Asia"],"keyphrases":["bushmeat management","role of bushmeat","people","human populations","true contributions of bushmeat","booming commercial bushmeat trade","food security of millions","human livelihoods","human dimension","alternative sources of food","consequent decline of numerous wildlife populations","flexible approaches","long term","emergence","unprecedented harvest rates","key contributor","Africa","adherence","unswerving biocentric","anthropocentric convictions","risk of failure","technological elaborations","need","necessity","biodiversity preservation","income","developing world","level of destruction","well-being","nutrition","principal source of protein","certain trade-offs","problem","perspective","Latin America","Asia","requirements","focus","ecosystems","Abstract Wild meat","understanding","far-reaching impacts of overexploitation","little effort","hand","date","research efforts","infrastructure","biological disciplines","animals","synthesis","paper","future"],"language":"en"},

Our previous studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus-like particles (VLPs) can be assembled using a recombinant baculovirus (rBV) expression system and such VLPs induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice after subcutaneous injection. Here, we investigated mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV VLPs in a mouse model. Mice were immunized in parallel, intraperitoneally or intranasally, with VLPs alone or with VLPs plus cytosine\u2013phosphate\u2013guanosine (CpG). Immune responses, including the production of SARS-CoV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), were determined in mucosal secretions and tissues. Both immunizations induced SARS-CoV-specific IgG, although the levels of IgG in groups immunized via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route were higher. sIgA was detected in saliva in groups immunized intranasally but not in groups immunized intraperitoneally. CpG had an adjuvant effect on IgA production in genital tract washes when administered intranasally but only affected IgA production in faeces samples when administered intraperitoneally. In addition, IgA was also detected in mucosal tissues from the lung and intestine, while CpG induced an increased level of IgA in the intestine. Most importantly, neutralization antibodies were detected in sera after i.p. and intranasal (i.n.) immunizations. Secretions in genital tract washes from the i.n. group also showed neutralization activity. Furthermore, VLPs that were administered intraperitoneally elicited cellular immune responses as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay analyses. In summary, our study indicates that mucosal immunization with rBV SARS-CoV VLPs represent an effective means for eliciting protective systemic and mucosal immune responses against SARS-CoV, providing important information for vaccine design.","publish_time":"2010-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Baojing; Huang, Yi; Huang, Li; Li, Bao; Zheng, Zhenhua; Chen, Ze; Chen, Jianjun; Hu, Qinxue; Wang, Hanzhong","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10bfc116d09c83821e5a45e1f1b7bc8f38fc32b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2878469.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010.03231.x; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010.03231.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20406307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rBV SARS-CoV VLPs","mucosal immune responses","production of SARS","mucosal tissues","mucosal secretions","elicited cellular immune responses","specific IgG","mucosal immunization","CpG","groups","affected IgA production","CoV-specific serum immunoglobulin G","genital tract washes","levels of IgG","increased level of IgA","intestine","mice","sIgA","immunizations","secretory immunoglobulin","attractive route","neutralization antibodies","neutralization activity","prophylaxis of respiratory diseases","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","expression system","effective means","enzyme-linked immunospot","adjuvant effect","ELISPOT","important information","cytosine","subcutaneous injection","assay analyses","vaccination","recombinant baculovirus","study","faeces samples","phosphate","guanosine","lung","previous studies","vaccine design","mouse model","sera","saliva","particles","Nasal administration","summary","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board\u2010certified acute care physicians in Japan were requested between March and May 2015 to provide a written evaluation of the infection control in the emergency department. RESULTS: A total of 51 of 303 (16.8%) hospitals had no manuals regarding infection control in the emergency department. Among 250 hospitals having emergency department manuals, 115 (46.0%) did not include contents regarding disinfection and sterilization for imaging examination rooms, and only 44 (17.6%) had criteria for contacting the emergency medical service when patients are suspected of, or diagnosed with, communicable diseases.

We partnered with the government ministries responsible for human, animal, and environmental health to identify a list of zoonotic diseases \u2013 rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, trypanosomiasis and highly pathogenic avian influenza \u2013 as the country\u0027s top priorities. We used each priority disease as a case study to identify existing processes for prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, laboratory confirmation, reporting and response across the three ministries. Results were used to produce disease-specific systems \u201Cmaps\u201D emphasizing linkages across the systems, as well as opportunities for improvement. We identified brucellosis as a particularly neglected condition. Past efforts to build avian influenza capabilities, which had degraded substantially in less than a decade, highlighted the challenge of sustainability. We observed a keen interest across sectors to reinvigorate national rabies control, and given the regional and global support for One Health approaches to rabies elimination, rabies could serve as an ideal disease to test incipient One Health coordination mechanisms and procedures. Overall, we identified five major categories of gaps and challenges: (1) Coordination; (2) Training; (3) Infrastructure; (4) Public Awareness; and (5) Research. We developed and prioritized recommendations to address the gaps, estimated the level of resource investment needed, and estimated a timeline for implementation. These prioritized recommendations can be used by the Government of Guinea to plan strategically for future One Health efforts, ideally under the auspices of the national One Health Platform.

Effective vaccines are needed urgently for viral respiratory diseases, but progress has been disappointingly slow. Vaccine candidates often show reduced efficacy in infancy, in partially immune adults, the immunocompromised, and the elderly.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn \u03B1-helix chain (residues 47\u201354) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47. During MD simulations, Glu47 of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the P3Lys of the octapeptide.

We have now successfully expressed protein C using the baculovirus system in S. frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. This recombinant baculovirus expressing protein C was first characterized using five SARS convalescent human sera and five normal human sera. The results showed that protein C is an authentic antigen against SARS-CoV antibody. Our Spike protein-based immunoflourescence assay (IFA) based on this recombinant baculovirus-Sf-9 system was further assessed with a panel of 163 clinical samples collected during the SARS epidemic in Singapore, which include samples from 21 clinically confirmed SARS, 42 non-SARS patient sera, and 100 normal sera. The results were compared to a commercial SARS IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Germany) and a conventional IFA test performed in Singapore General Hospital. All of the 21 SARS-positive serum samples could be recognized by our IFA, giving a specificity and sensitivity of 100%, which was compatible with both whole virus-based IFA assays. No cross-reactivity with serum samples against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were detected in our assays. Thus, our Spike protein-based IFA could offer a safer procedure which can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory as it could mimic the whole virus based-IFA without any loss of sensitivity and specificity. It is also more user-friendly and cost-effective than the whole virus-based IFA.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manopo, Ivanus; Lu, Liqun; He, Qigai; Chee, Li Lian; Chan, Shzu-Wei; Kwang, Jimmy","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3089861dc2b4f9e4f09793f5f397c54a5a57346e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094334.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175904003825; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175904003825","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS IFA","IFA","Singapore General Hospital"],"locations":["Singapore","Germany"],"keyphrases":["Spike protein-based IFA","protein C","virus-based IFA assays","confirmed SARS","SARS epidemic","commercial SARS IFA kit","SARS convalescent human sera","SARS-positive serum samples","SARS-CoV antibody","non-SARS patient sera","Spike protein-based immunoflourescence assay","conventional IFA test","normal sera","normal human sera","clinical samples","baculovirus system","infectious bronchitis virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","recombinant baculovirus-Sf","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome","immunodominant fragment of Spike","specificity","results","loss of sensitivity","Singapore General Hospital","truncated antigenic fragment","IBV","Germany","EUROIMMUN","coronavirus","authentic antigen","cross-reactivity","TGEV","frugiperda","panel","safer procedure","amino acids","cells","BSL","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

A multi-country matched case-control study was conducted in 2011 to identify calf-level risk factors for BNP. 405 BNP cases were recruited from 330 farms in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands by laboratory confirmation of farmer-reported cases. Up to four calves of similar age from the same farm were selected as controls (1154 calves). Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire. Multivariable modelling using conditional logistic regression indicated that PregSure\u00AEBVD (PregSure, Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination of the dam was strongly associated with BNP cases (adjusted matched Odds Ratio - amOR 17.8 first lactation dams; 95% confidence interval \u2013 ci 2.4, 134.4; p = 0.005), and second or more lactation PregSure-vaccinated dams were more likely to have a case than first lactation vaccinated dams (amOR 2.2 second lactation; ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024; amOR 5.3 third or more lactation; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = \u003C0.001).

By using in vitro assays, we found that the purified PLP2 could efficiently cleave K63 and K48 linked polyubiquitin chains Ub3-7 in vitro although displaying a differential activity in converting the respective ubiquitin dimers to monomer. The subsequent mutagenesis analyses revealed that the requirement for PLP2 DUB activity surprisingly resembled that for cis-cleavage activity, as several mutations (e.g., D91R, D85R, etc.) that largely ablated the DUB function also blocked the cis- but not trans-proteolytic cleavage of nsp2/3 polyprotein. Moreover, the analyses identified key mutations that could differentiate DUB from PLP2 cis- and trans-cleavage activities. Further reverse genetics analyses revealed the following findings: (i) mutations that largely blocked the DUB activity were all lethal to the virus, (ii) a point mutation T88G that selectively blocked the cis-cleavage activity of PLP2 did not affect viral viability in cell culture, and (iii) an E90Q mutation that did not affect either of the PLP2 activities led to rescue of WT-like virus but displayed significantly reduced ability to induce TNF-\u03B1 production. Our findings support the possibility that the PLP2 DUB activity, but not cis-cleavage activity, is essential for PRRSV replication. The data also establish a strong link of nsp2 to pro-inflammatory cytokine induction during infection that operates in a manner independent of PLP2 DUB activity.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Shaochuan; Ge, Xinna; Kong, Can; Liu, Teng; Liu, Aijing; Gao, Peng; Song, Jiangwei; Zhou, Lei; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/356f0fd788357570d8316ea566c88002554745b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6832237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP2 cis","cis-cleavage activity of PLP2","manner independent of PLP2 DUB activity","PLP2 activities","purified PLP2","differential activity","DUB function","trans-cleavage activities","trans-proteolytic cleavage of nsp2","infection","key mutations","nsp2 replicase protein","strong link of nsp2","respiratory syndrome virus","reverse genetics analyses","subsequent mutagenesis analyses","PRRSV replication","following findings","E90Q mutation","point mutation T88G","pro-inflammatory cytokine induction","K63","requirement","K48","deubiquitinating enzyme","respective ubiquitin dimers","reduced ability","N-terminus","viral viability","polyubiquitin chains Ub3","role","biochemical properties","rescue of WT","TNF-\u03B1 production","possibility","cell culture","monomer","cysteine protease","polyprotein","papain","data","D91R","D85R","assays"],"language":"en"},

The scientific community has developed a wide range of open source software, providing freely available advanced processing and analysis approaches. The programming and statistics environment R has emerged as one of the most popular environments to process and analyse Metabolomics datasets. A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis.

Uncia uncia) but the ecological studies on this animal are scarce since it is human shy by nature and lives in difficult mountainous tracts. The pilot study is conducted to exploit the genetic diversity and population structure of the snow leopard in this selected natural habitat of the member of the wildcat family in Pakistan. METHOD: About 50 putative scat samples of snow leopard from five localities of Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan) along with a control sample of zoo maintained male snow leopard were collected for comparison. Significant quality and quantity of genomic DNA was extracted from scat samples using combined Zhang\u2013phenol\u2013chloroform method and successful amplification of cytochrome c oxidase I gene (190 bp) using mini-barcode primers, seven simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers and Y-linked AMELY gene (200 bp) was done. RESULTS: Cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequencing suggested that 33/50 (66%) scat samples were of snow leopard. AMELY primer suggested that out of 33 amplified samples, 21 (63.63%) scats were from male and 12 (36.36%) from female leopards. Through successful amplification of DNA of 25 out of 33 (75.75%) scat samples using SSR markers, a total of 68 alleles on seven SSR loci were identified, showing low heterozygosity, while high gene flow between population. DISCUSSION: The low gene flow rate among the population results in low genetic diversity causing decreased diversification. This affects the adaptability to climatic changes, thus ultimately resulting in decreased population size of the species.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aruge, Samreen; Batool, Hafsa; Khan, Fida M.; Fakhar-i-Abbas,; Janjua, Safia","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/008d980cbcc283a9b707de3d9a02573dde8528ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6836756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["male snow leopard","putative scat samples of snow leopard","Uncia uncia","gene sequencing","population results","amplified samples","low gene flow rate","high gene flow","SSR markers","population structure","low genetic diversity","decreased population size","Y-linked AMELY gene","Panthera uncia","low heterozygosity","successful amplification of cytochrome c oxidase","SSR loci","bp","successful amplification of DNA","selected natural habitat","chloroform method","decreased diversification","AMELY primer","quantity of genomic DNA","phenol","Karakoram mountain ranges","Pakistan\u2019s northern areas","simple sequence repeats","member","combined Zhang","mini-barcode primers","Hindu Kush","control sample of zoo","nature","ecological studies","total","localities of Gilgit-Baltistan","human shy","animal","Significant quality","alleles","DISCUSSION","wildcat family","difficult mountainous tracts","BACKGROUND","species","comparison","climatic changes","adaptability","pilot study","female leopards","scats"],"language":"en"},

One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing\u2013based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chi-Mai; Jyan, Hong-Wei; Chien, Shih-Chieh; Jen, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Lee, Po-Chang; Lee, Chun-Fu; Yang, Yi-Ting; Chen, Meng-Yu; Chen, Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Chan, Chang-Chuan","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353827/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diamond Princess","National Health Insurance"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["contact population","smart contact tracing","efficient contact tracing","big sensor surveillance data","mobile sensor data","health insurance data","better use of big data analytics","unique application of big data analytics","conventional epidemiological contact tracing","National Health Insurance claims big data","potential contact-persons","follow-up","self-quarantine","confirmed COVID","self-restriction","self-monitoring","cases of respiratory syndrome","SARS-CoV","pneumonia","outcome","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","general population","symptomatic contacts","index case","mobile geopositioning method","outbreak of coronavirus disease","case-fatality rates","automated alert messaging","resources","rapid analysis","SMS","major success","polymerase chain reaction","Low infection","reverse transcription","management","Taiwanese people","days","tests","Information","CONCLUSIONS","Diamond Princess cruise ship","reasons","Keelung harbor","BACKGROUND","screening","METHODS","day tour","passengers","OBJECTIVE","total","isolation","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The data was obtained from the Kuwait National Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PIDs) Registry during the period of 2004-2018. Results: A total of 274 PID children were registered in KNPIDR during the study period with predominance of immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity, followed by combined immunodeficiencies with associated syndromic features and diseases of immune dysregulation. Overall infectious complications affected 82.4% of the patients, and viral infections affected 31.7% of the registered patients. Forty-five patients (16.4%) developed viral infections caused by at least 2 organisms, among those 20 patients were affected by three or more viral infections. There was a statistically significant association between viral infections and PID category. However, there was no statistically significant association between viral infections and gender or the patients\u0027 onset age. There was a total of 170 viral infections during the study period and the causes of these infections were predominated by CMV (22.2%), adenovirus (11.7%), EBV (11.1%), and enteroviruses (7.4%). CMV and parainfluenza infections were more common in the group of immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity while EBV and human papilloma virus (HPV) were more common in the immune dysregulation group and combined immunodeficiencies with associated syndromic features, respectively. The most common presentation was viremia (28.8%) followed by pneumonia (28.2%) and skin infections (17.6%). The most common causes of viremia were CMV followed by adenovirus and EBV, while the most common organisms causing pneumonia were CMV followed by rhinovirus and parainfluenza. There were 80 deaths among the registered patients, 10% were caused by viral infections. Conclusions: Viral infections are common in PIDs and result into a wide-range of clinical manifestations causing significant morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Herz, Waleed; Essa, Sahar","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1894cac8794748c11482c059bc5a2c6d4f1e9527.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6549382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191561/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PID","CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spectrum of viral infections","parainfluenza infections","skin infections","common organisms","CMV","registered patients","common presentation","common causes of viremia","combined immunodeficiencies","group of immunodeficiencies","EBV","predominance of immunodeficiencies","significant association","study period","humoral immunity","PIDs","associated syndromic features","immune dysregulation group","significant morbidity","PID children","pneumonia","total","adenovirus","diseases of immune dysregulation","primary immunodeficient children","PID category","Kuwait National Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders","gender","clinical manifestations","human papilloma virus","wide-range","Registry","HPV","KNPIDR","mortality","patients\u0027 onset age","frequency","data","rhinovirus","Conclusions","Results","deaths","infectious complications","Methods","Objective","enteroviruses"],"language":"en"},

The viral carriers carry pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), used by the original virus for targeting DC, and are particularly efficient and versatile gene delivery vectors. Efforts in the field of synthetic vaccine carriers are focussing on decorating the particle surface with ligands for DC receptors such as heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan structures, integrins, Siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins and toll-like receptors.

The possibility of rapid testing has been facilitated by development of cartridge-based random access molecular technologies that are now widely available. Whether the expense of cartridge-based assays is justified in terms of clinical or laboratory cost savings is controversial. This prospective study evaluated the impact of the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (\u2018FilmArray\u2019), a cartridge-based random access molecular test, compared with standard batched molecular testing using an \u2018in-house\u2019 respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on laboratory and health service outcomes for adult patients at a tertiary-level adult hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Laboratory result turnaround time was significantly reduced with the FilmArray (median 4.4 h) compared to a standard validated in-house respiratory PCR assay (median 21.6 h, p \u003C 0.0001) and there was a significant increase in diagnostic yield with the Filmarray (71/124, 57.3%) compared to in-house PCR (79/200; 39.5%; p = 0.002). Despite improved result turnaround time and increased diagnostic yield from testing, there was no corresponding reduction in hospital length of stay or use of isolation beds. Although cartridge-based molecular testing reduced turnaround time to result for respiratory pathogen testing, it did not impact on health service outcomes such as hospital length of stay. Further work is warranted to determine whether cartridge-based tests at the point of care can improve clinical and health service impacts.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madigan, Victoria M.; Sinickas, Vincent G.; Giltrap, Dawn; Kyriakou, Peter; Ryan, Katherine; Chan, Hiu-Tat; Clifford, Vanessa","journal":"Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/292af2b130a0c0c0f6d3640a4f74ad9ed7131ee5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111697.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031302518302551; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031302518302551; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pathol.2018.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Melbourne","Australia"],"keyphrases":["respiratory pathogen testing","cartridge-based tests","standard batched molecular testing","in-house PCR","Laboratory result turnaround time","health service outcomes","clinical outcomes","rapid microbiological testing","development of cartridge","possibility of rapid testing","expense of cartridge","based assays","random access molecular test","Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel","random access molecular technologies","improved result turnaround time","standard validated in-house respiratory PCR assay","health service impacts","hospital length of stay","terms of clinical","tertiary-level adult hospital","respiratory polymerase chain reaction","increased diagnostic yield","laboratory cost savings","adult patients","point of care","Melbourne","demand","view","Australia","corresponding reduction","significant increase","prospective study","Summary","isolation beds","work"],"language":"en"},

The strain CHN-JS-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%\u201399.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-\u03BAB. At the same time, the expressions of FcRn, pIgR, and NF-\u03BAB mRNA are also positively correlated in infected piglets. These results may help explain the immunological and pathological changes associated with porcine deltacorononirus infection.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Shaoju; Jia, Xiangchao; Gao, Zitong; Zhang, Weida; Xu, Qingrong; Li, Zili","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95cd65dbf317e24c13557dbf46ffbaa4c206f8be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31936476/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pIgR","infected piglets","strain CHN-JS","day-old piglets","genome of CHN","intestinal mucosa of normal piglets","NF-\u03BAB mRNA","expressions of FcRn","expression of FcRn","level of FcRn mRNA","porcine deltacorononirus infection","Porcine deltacoronavirus","watery diarrhea","polymeric immunoglobulin receptor","porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus","crucial immunoglobulin","sequence analysis","PDCoV strains","neonatal Fc receptor","nucleotide sequence alignment","transmission electron microscopy","receptors","serious economic losses","nuclear factor-kappa B","immunofluorescence assays","transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G","IgG","cytopathology","pathological changes","immunohistochemical staining","viral antigens","IgA","pig industry","microscopic lesions","death","small intestine","IgM","time","pathogenicity","results"],"language":"en"},

Various genotyping assays have been developed for diagnostic and screening purposes but with certain limitations in sensitivity, specificity, cost effectiveness and/or time savings. Since the discovery of ligase chain reaction (LCR) in the late nineties, it became one of the most favored platforms for detecting these variants and also for genotyping low abundant contaminants. Recent and powerful modifications with the integration of various detection strategies such as electrochemical and magnetic biosensors, nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots, quartz crystal and leaky surface acoustic surface biosensors, DNAzyme, rolling circle amplification (RCA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS), chemiluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer have been introduced to both LCR and ligation based amplifications to enable high-throughput and inexpensive multiplex genotyping with improved robustness, simplicity, sensitivity and specificity. In this article, classical and up to date modifications in LCR and ligation based amplifications are critically evaluated and compared with emphasis on points of strength and weakness, sensitivity, cost, running time, equipment needed, applications and multiplexing potential. Versatile genotyping applications such as genetic diseases detection, bacterial and viral pathogens detection are also detailed. Ligation based gold NPs biosensor, ligation based RCA and ligation mediated SDA assays enhanced detection limit tremendously with a discrimination power approaching 1.5aM, 2aM and 0.1fM respectively. MLPA (multiplexed ligation dependent probe amplification) and SNPlex assays have been commercialized for multiplex detection of at least 48 SNPs at a time. MOL-PCR (multiplex oligonucleotide ligation) has high-throughput capability with multiplex detection of 50 SNPs/well in a 96 well plate. Ligase detection reaction (LDR) is one of the most widely used LCR versions that have been successfully integrated with several detection strategies with improved sensitivity down to 0.4fM.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibriel, Abdullah A.; Adel, Ola","journal":"Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27de682626e46dcd25aab564f76557d2d903d769.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108312.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mrrev.2017.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383574216301570; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574216301570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28927538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDA","LCR","RCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex detection","detection limit","genetic diseases detection","multiplex oligonucleotide ligation","Ligase detection reaction","viral pathogens detection","ligation mediated SDA assays","integration of various detection strategies","improved sensitivity","inexpensive multiplex genotyping","Various genotyping assays","multiplexed ligation dependent probe amplification","LCR versions","Versatile genotyping applications","leaky surface acoustic surface biosensors","RCA","circle amplification","SNPlex assays","specificity","amplifications","Abstract Genetic variants","SNPs","time savings","fM","surface enhanced raman scattering","strand displacement amplification","high-throughput capability","magnetic biosensors","improved robustness","cost effectiveness","date modifications","powerful modifications","discovery of ligase chain reaction","gold NPs biosensor","quartz crystal","DNAzyme","chemiluminescence","SERS","quantum dots","nanoparticles","certain limitations","simplicity","weakness","equipment","MLPA","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","screening purposes","points of strength","MOL-PCR","emphasis","multiplexing potential","discrimination power","LDR","low abundant contaminants","late nineties","favored platforms","plate"],"language":"en"},

Comparison of macro domains from MERS-CoV and other human CoVs revealed structural differences in the \u03B11 helix alters how the conserved Asp-20 interacts with ADP-ribose and may explain the efficient binding of the MERS-CoV macro domain to ADP-ribose. This study provides structural and biophysical bases to further evaluate the role of the MERS-CoV macro domain in the host response via ADP-ribose binding but also as a potential target for drug design.","publish_time":"2016-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Chao-Cheng; Lin, Meng-Hsuan; Chuang, Chien-Ying; Hsu, Chun-Hua","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/162e33930709086c9e1d68899d5c776e7b492cc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4777827.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.700542; http://www.jbc.org/content/291/10/4894.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV macro domain","conserved macro domain","ADP-ribose binding","Comparison of macro domains","ribose binding module","efficient binding","structural differences","conserved Asp","human CoVs","crystal structure","efficient adenosine diphosphate","host response","emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","isothermal titration calorimetry","\u03B11 helix","differential scanning fluorimetry","role","potential target","biophysical bases","precise biochemical function","complex","\u212B resolution","non-structural protein","drug design","study"],"language":"en"},

Subversion of the cellular machinery that controls replication of the infected host cell is a common activity of many viruses. Viruses employ different strategies to deregulate cell cycle checkpoint controls and modulate cell proliferation pathways. A number of DNA and RNA viruses encode proteins that target critical cell cycle regulators to achieve cellular conditions that are beneficial for viral replication. Many DNA viruses induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle; this is thought to increase pools of deoxynucleotides and thus, facilitate viral replication. In contrast, some viruses can arrest cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle that is favorable for replication of the specific virus. Cell cycle arrest may inhibit early cell death of infected cells, allow the cells to evade immune defenses, or help promote virus assembly. Although beneficial for the viral life cycle, virus-mediated alterations in normal cell cycle control mechanisms could have detrimental effects on cellular physiology and may ultimately contribute to pathologies associated with the viral infection, including cell transformation and cancer progression and maintenance. In this chapter, we summarize various strategies employed by DNA and RNA viruses to modulate the replication cycle of the virus-infected cell. When known, we describe how these virus-associated effects influence replication of the virus and contribute to diseases associated with infection by that specific virus.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bagga, Sumedha; Bouchard, Michael J.","journal":"Cell Cycle Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41408b2fae37e56b390a87a721437965c6d577c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-0888-2_10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-infected cell","Cell cycle arrest","replication cycle","cell transformation","cell cycle checkpoint controls","infected host cell","critical cell cycle regulators","viral replication","DNA viruses","early cell death of infected cells","normal cell cycle control mechanisms","RNA viruses","specific virus","cell proliferation pathways","viral life cycle","virus assembly","virus-associated effects influence replication","quiescent cells","virus-mediated alterations","viral infection","cellular conditions","cellular physiology","cellular machinery","number of DNA","detrimental effects","different strategies","various strategies","proteins","new progeny","common activity","cancer progression","immune defenses","particular phase","help","maintenance","factors","genomes","pathologies","diseases","chapter","Subversion","pools of deoxynucleotides","contrast"],"language":"en"},

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted within the Convention of University Professors of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in Germany from April 3 to April 11, 2020. A bipolar 5-point Likert scale (with possible responses of \u0022totally disagree,\u0022 \u0022rather disagree,\u0022 \u0022neutral,\u0022 \u0022rather agree,\u0022 and \u0022totally agree\u0022) was applied. Fifty-two (69.3%) of 75 clinic directors participated. RESULTS Communication and cooperation with the government, hospital administration, and other departments during the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly perceived as appropriate. However, only 7 respondents (13.7%) totally agreed or rather agreed with the statement that the authorities are supporters of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments. Substantial financial and personnel changes in orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments of university hospitals were reported, resulting in an average reduction of 49.4% in operating room capacity and an expected 29.3% loss of revenue. In addition, 14.7% of physicians were reallocated from orthopaedic and trauma surgery to other care-delivery environments. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in German university hospitals. Distinct structural and financial effects were noted. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the commitment of our specialty to overcome the pandemic by providing competent personnel as well as close cooperation with the hospital administration and other departments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first Germany-wide survey among the heads of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in university hospitals on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey results may help to inform system-wide decision-making in Germany, in Europe, and beyond.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haffer, Henryk; Sch\u00F6mig, Friederike; Rickert, Markus; Randau, Thomas; Raschke, Michael; Wirtz, Dieter; Pumberger, Matthias; Perka, Carsten","journal":"The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Objective To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent. Positive cultures of Haemophilus influenzae dominated in RSV and rhinovirus single infections and Moraxella catarrhalis in RSV viral co-infections.

Chronic hemodialysis use was more common among patients with MRSA (20.0%) than pneumococcal (2.6%) and all-cause non-S. aureus (3.7%) CAP. Otherwise, clinical features at admission were similar, including concurrent influenza infection, hemoptysis, multilobar infiltrates, and prehospital antibiotics. Patients with MRSA CAP had more severe clinical outcomes than those with pneumococcal CAP, including intensive care unit admission (86.7% vs 34.8%) and in-patient mortality (13.3% vs 4.4%). Conclusions. Despite very low prevalence of S. aureus and, specifically, MRSA, nearly one-third of adults hospitalized with CAP received anti-MRSA antibiotics. The clinical presentation of MRSA CAP overlapped substantially with pneumococcal CAP, highlighting the challenge of accurately targeting empirical anti-MRSA antibiotics with currently available clinical tools and the need for new diagnostic strategies.","publish_time":"2016-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Self, Wesley H.; Wunderink, Richard G.; Williams, Derek J.; Zhu, Yuwei; Anderson, Evan J.; Balk, Robert A.; Fakhran, Sherene S.; Chappell, James D.; Casimir, Geoffrey; Courtney, D.

In most cases, infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease, although acute infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Importantly, no drugs against human coronaviruses exist, and only supportive therapy is available. Previously, we proposed the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and its hydrophobically-modified derivative (HM-HTCC) as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Here, we show that HTCC inhibits interaction of a virus with its receptor and thus blocks the entry. Further, we demonstrate that HTCC polymers with different degrees of substitution act as effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milewska, Aleksandra; Kaminski, Kamil; Ciejka, Justyna; Kosowicz, Katarzyna; Zeglen, Slawomir; Wojarski, Jacek; Nowakowska, Maria; Szczubia\u0142ka, Krzysztof; Pyrc, Krzysztof","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91c146beba875fde88ed4e4770cfb6325ad2f038.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4889042.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HTCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43","MERS coronaviruses","low-pathogenic human coronaviruses","HCoV-HKU1","coronavirus HCoV-NL63","HM-HTCC","HTCC polymers","severe disease","cationically modified chitosan","effective inhibitors","potent inhibitors","pathogenic SARS","acute infections","respiratory infections","hydrophobically-modified derivative","trimethylammonium chitosan chloride","different degrees of substitution act","elderly","infants","immunocompromised patients","supportive therapy","receptor","hydroxypropyl","interaction","cases","humans","exception","hospitalization","date","drugs","entry"],"language":"en"},

There are many ways solutes are transported across the thin (~40 \u00C5) hydrophobic barrier. Transport is divided into passive diffusion and active transport. A biological membrane is semi-permeable, being permeable to some molecules, most notably water, while being very impermeable to most solutes that require some form of transporter. Passive diffusion (simple and facilitated) only requires the energy inherent in the solute\u2019s electrochemical gradient and results in equilibrium across the membrane. In contrast, active transport requires additional energy (i.e. ATP), and results in a non-equilibrium, net accumulation of the solute. Passive transport can involve simple diffusion or facilitated carriers including ionophores and channels. Active transport comes in many, often complex forms. Examples of active transport include primary active transport (uniport), secondary active transport (cotransport, antiport) and group translocation. Besides the multitude of transport systems, transport can be accomplished by Gap Junctions, receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, exocytosis and apoptotic membrane blebbing.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stillwell, William","journal":"An Introduction to Biological Membranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ab5bac23479ddada58d37cb139d5033bc9bfeaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182113.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444521538000143; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444521538000143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Passive transport","secondary active transport","primary active transport","Examples of active transport","multitude of transport systems","passive diffusion","simple diffusion","results","biological membrane","apoptotic membrane blebbing","non-equilibrium","additional energy","energy inherent","solute movement","ways solutes","pinocytosis","uniport","receptor-mediated endocytosis","phagocytosis","exocytosis","solute\u2019s electrochemical gradient","cotransport","antiport","cells","Gap Junctions","net accumulation","carriers","ionophores","ATP","contrast","essential feature of life","group translocation","molecules","hydrophobic barrier","water","channels","form of transporter","complex forms"],"language":"en"},

The present work focused on peptide domains within FCoV 3b that drive its intracellular trafficking. Transfection of different cell types with FCoV 3b fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or 3\u00D7FLAG confirmed localization of FCoV 3b in the mitochondria and nucleoli. Using serial truncated mutants, we showed that nucleolar accumulation is controlled by a joint nucleolar and nuclear localization signal (NoLS/NLS) in which the identified overlapping pat4 motifs (residues 53\u201357) play a critical role. Mutational analysis also revealed that mitochondrial translocation is mediated by N-terminal residues 10\u201335, in which a Tom20 recognition motif (residues 13\u201317) and two other overlapping hexamers (residues 24\u201330) associated with mitochondrial targeting were identified.

Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated. METHODS: A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 29 was retrospectively analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR, were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between the baseline NLR and in-hospital all-cause death. A sensitivity analysis was performed by converting NLR from a continuous variable to a categorical variable according to tertile. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: 245 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analyses, and the in-hospital mortality was 13.47%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was 8% higher risk of in-hospital mortality for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.0147). Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, the NLR of patients in the highest tertile had a 15.04-fold higher risk of death (OR = 16.04; 95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; P = 0.0395) after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the fully adjusted OR for mortality was 1.10 in males for each unit increase of NLR (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.19; P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients especially for male.

The clinical importance of HBoV infection remains unclear. This report describes the clinical features and molecular phylogeny of HBoV isolates in children with acute respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 1,528 children with acute respiratory infections between 2010 and 2011. Respiratory samples were screened for HBoV by multiplex PCR. A phylogenetic analysis of the HBoV VP1/VP2 gene was also undertaken. HBoV was detected in 187 (12.2%) of the 1,528 patients with a peak incidence of infection observed in patients aged 12\u201324 months. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was observed in 107 (57.2%) of the HBoV\u2010positive children. The peak of HBoV activity occurred during the month of June in both 2010 and 2011. A higher previous history of wheezing (P = 0.016), a higher frequency of chest retraction (P \u003C 0.001) and wheezing (P = 0.022), a higher respiratory symptom score (P = 0.002), and a longer duration of hospital stay (P = 0.021) were observed in HBoV\u2010positive children compared with the HBoV\u2010negative group. Phylogenetic analysis showed all 187 HBoV\u2010positive isolates were identified as HBoV 1, indicating minimal sequence variations among the isolates.

To better inform triage decisions of hospitalization and management, we developed a clinical prediction rule for diagnosing patients with A(H7N9) and determined its predictive performance. METHODS: Clinical details on presentation of adult patients hospitalized with either A(H7N9)(n = 121) in China from March to May 2013 or other causes of acute respiratory infections (n = 2,603) in Jingzhou City, China from January 2010 through September 2012 were analyzed. A clinical prediction rule was developed using a two-step coefficient-based multivariable logistic regression scoring method and evaluated with internal validation by bootstrapping. RESULTS: In step 1, predictors for A(H7N9) included male sex, poultry exposure history, and fever, haemoptysis, or shortness of breath on history and physical examination. In step 2, haziness or pneumonic consolidation on chest radiographs and leukopenia were also associated with a higher probability of A(H7N9). The observed risk of A(H7N9) was 0.3% for those assigned to the low-risk group and 2.5%, 4.3%, and 44.0% for tertiles 1 through 3, respectively, in the high-risk group. This prediction rule achieved good model performance, with an optimism-corrected sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.80, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: A simple decision rule based on data readily obtainable in the setting of patients\u2019 first clinical presentations from the first wave of the A/H7N9 epidemic in China has been developed. This prediction rule has achieved good model performance in predicting their risk of A(H7N9) infection and should be useful in guiding important clinical and public health decisions in a timely and objective manner. Data to be gathered with its use in the current evolving second wave of the A/H7N9 epidemic in China will help to inform its performance in the field and contribute to its further refinement.

The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort. METHODS: We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 0\u00B727 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 0\u00B724\u20130\u00B731; median age 5 months [IQR 3\u20139]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 0\u00B705 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0\u00B704\u20130\u00B707]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4\u20136) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4\u20137) recorded in induced sputum (p=0\u00B748 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 11\u00B708, 95% CI 1\u00B733\u201392\u00B754), respiratory syncytial virus (8\u00B705, 4\u00B721\u201315\u00B738), or influenza virus (4\u00B713, 2\u00B706\u20138\u00B726) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses. INTERPRETATION: Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

Smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have been reported to be more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Here, we determined the expression of MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), in lung tissues of smokers without airflow limitation and COPD patients in comparison to nonsmoking individuals (never-smokers). METHODS: DPP4 expression was measured in lung tissue of lung resection specimens of never-smokers, smokers without airflow limitation, COPD GOLD stage II patients and in lung explants of end-stage COPD patients. Both control subjects and COPD patients were well phenotyped and age-matched. The mRNA expression was determined using qRT-PCR and protein expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In smokers and subjects with COPD, both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher compared to never-smokers. Additionally, we found that both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that DPP4 is upregulated in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. These data also highlight a possible role of DPP4 in COPD pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seys, Leen J M; Widagdo, W; Verhamme, Fien M; Kleinjan, Alex; Janssens, Wim; Joos, Guy F; Bracke, Ken R; Haagmans, Bart L; Brusselle, Guy G","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdf62e9b24357ae780c54ec5a3f0849ccf9cdb07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020176/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix741","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["DPP4 expression","stage COPD patients","expression of MERS","lung tissues of smokers","COPD pathogenesis","DPP4 mRNA","protein expression","lungs of smokers","mRNA expression","COPD GOLD stage","MERS-CoV infection","lung function","possible role of DPP4","lung tissue of lung resection specimens","CoV receptor","lung explants of end","airflow limitation","nonsmoking individuals","control subjects","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dipeptidyl peptidase IV","comparison","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","BACKGROUND","pneumonia","high case fatality rate","qRT-PCR","humans","diffusing capacity parameters","data","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","RESULTS","immunohistochemistry","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P \u003C .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma. The severity of cold symptoms was also increased in women with asthma (total cold score median, 8; interquartile range [5, 10] in women with asthma vs 6 [5, 8] in control subjects; P = .031). Among women with asthma, having a laboratory-confirmed viral infection was associated with poorer maternal health, with 60% of infections associated with uncontrolled asthma and a higher likelihood of preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma. Colds during pregnancy were associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Prevention of viral infection in pregnancy may improve the health of mothers with asthma.","publish_time":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murphy, Vanessa E.; Powell, Heather; Wark, Peter A.B.; Gibson, Peter G.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1e60d88f6f1e9cf30070aa05aa86dc1e762ad99.json; document_parses/pdf_json/422ba1058ef4ab555ac1a874029c600f71d80520.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107276.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493968/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369213605152; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.12-1956; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369213605152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma outcomes","uncontrolled asthma","asthma vs","Pregnant women","pregnancy outcomes","common colds","early pregnancy","common cold questionnaire","common cold symptoms","Respiratory viral infections","consequences of respiratory viral infection","severity of cold symptoms","Prevention of viral infection","suspected infections","respiratory viruses","poorer maternal health","health impact","health of mothers","total cold score median","prospective cohort study","self-report","post partum","polymerase chain reaction","incidence rate ratio","interquartile range","throat swabs","BACKGROUND","laboratory","higher likelihood of preeclampsia","frequency","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","control subjects","objective"],"language":"en"},

High-throughput sequencing is an important technology for this purpose. However, viral nucleic acids often constitute a minute proportion of the total genetic material in a sample from infected tissue. Techniques to enrich viral targets in high-throughput sequencing have been reported, but the sensitivity of such methods is not well established. This study compares different library preparation techniques targeting both DNA and RNA with and without virion enrichment. By optimizing the selection of intact virus particles, both by physical and enzymatic approaches, we assessed the effectiveness of the specific enrichment of viral sequences as compared to non-enriched sample preparations by selectively looking for and counting read sequences obtained from shotgun sequencing. Using shotgun sequencing of total DNA or RNA, viral targets were detected at concentrations corresponding to the predicted level, providing a foundation for estimating the effectiveness of virion enrichment. Virion enrichment typically produced a 1000-fold increase in the proportion of DNA virus sequences. For RNA virions the gain was less pronounced with a maximum 13-fold increase. This enrichment varied between the different sample concentrations, with no clear trend. Despite that less sequencing was required to identify target sequences, it was not evident from our data that a lower detection level was achieved by virion enrichment compared to shotgun sequencing.","publish_time":"2015-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jensen, Randi Holm; Mollerup, Sarah; Mourier, Tobias; Hansen, Thomas Arn; Fridholm, Helena; Nielsen, Lars Peter; Willerslev, Eske; Hansen, Anders Johannes; Vinner, Lasse","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3725a278a669559c9fd096a9a7dd5f35c6928c6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4390369.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific enrichment of viral sequences","viral targets","effectiveness of virion enrichment","Viral infections","shotgun sequencing of total DNA","High-throughput sequencing","proportion of DNA virus sequences","different sample concentrations","viral nucleic acids","target sequences","read sequences","well-characterized viral pathogens","different diseases","RNA virions","fold increase","different library preparation techniques","minute proportion","emerging viruses","non-enriched sample preparations","novel viruses","predicted level","total genetic material","lower detection level","selection of intact virus particles","important technology","data","gain","search","study","foundation","enzymatic approaches","infected tissue","clear trend","great importance","methods","purpose","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

However, when acute sclerotherapy fails, and in cases where no further treatment is accessible, emergency surgery may be life saving. In the present study we retrospectively analyzed the results of the modified Sugiura procedure, performed as emergency and semi-elective treatment in the patient with bleeding esophageal varices. METHODS: Ninety patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension were managed in our department for variceal esophageal bleeding between January 1985 and December 1992. The modified Sugiura procedure was performed in 46 patients on an emergency (25 patients) or semi-elective (21 patients) basis. Liver cirrhosis stage according to Child classification was A in 4 patients, B in 16 patients, and C in 26 patients. RESULTS: Acute bleeding was controlled in all patients. Postoperative mortality was 23.9% (11 of 46 patients). The mortality rate was 34.6% in Child class C patients (9 of 26 patients), and 12.5% in Child class B patients (2 of 16 patients). Twenty-four patients had long-term follow-up extending from 14 months to 22 years (mean 83.1 months). Ten of 24 patients (41.6%) did not develop rebleeding for 5\u201322 years (mean 10.3 years). Overall 5-year survival in these 24 patients was 62.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The modified Sugiura procedure remains an effective rescue therapy for patients with bleeding esophageal varices when alternative treatments fail or are not indicated. Moreover, it can be a life-saving procedure in patients with anatomy unsuitable for shunt surgery or for patients treated in nonspecialized centers where surgical expertise for a shunt operation is not available.","publish_time":"2012-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voros, D.; Polydorou, A.; Polymeneas, G.; Vassiliou, I.; Melemeni, A.; Chondrogiannis, K.; Arapoglou, V.; Fragulidis, G.

EBOV VP35 is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase, it is a key participant of the nucleocapsid assembly and it inhibits the innate immune response by antagonizing RIG-I like receptors through its dsRNA binding function and, hence, by suppressing the host type I interferon (IFN) production. Insights into the VP35 dsRNA recognition have been recently revealed by structural and functional analysis performed on its C-terminus protein. We report the biochemical characterization of the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) full-length recombinant VP35 (rVP35)\u2013dsRNA binding function. We established a novel in vitro magnetic dsRNA binding pull down assay, determined the rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters, measured the rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant for heterologous in vitro transcribed dsRNA of different length and short synthetic dsRNA of 8bp, and validated the assay for compound screening by assessing the inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid (IC50 value of 50\u03BCg/mL). Furthermore, we compared the dsRNA binding properties of full length wt rVP35 with those of R305A, K309A and R312A rVP35 mutants, which were previously reported to be defective in dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition, showing that the latter have measurably increased K d values for dsRNA binding and modified migration patterns in mobility shift assays with respect to wt rVP35. Overall, these results provide the first characterization of the full-length wt and mutants VP35\u2013dsRNA binding functions.","publish_time":"2012-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zinzula, Luca; Esposito, Francesca; Pala, Daniela; Tramontano, Enzo","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0de2eeac8443a36c67b0d8e17872a3ce56a6471f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114247.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212000204; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212000204; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22289166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["dsRNA binding properties","magnetic dsRNA binding","dsRNA binding functions","VP35 dsRNA recognition","rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters","dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition","short synthetic dsRNA","transcribed dsRNA of different length","length wt rVP35","mutants VP35","VP35 protein","R312A rVP35 mutants","EBOV VP35","full-length recombinant VP35","full-length wt","rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant","host immune system","EBOVs replication","host type","biochemical characterization","innate immune response","C-terminus protein","modified migration patterns","mobility shift assays","multifunctional major virulence factor","ZEBOV","R305A","Zaire ebolavirus","inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid","essential component","evasion","respect","IC50 value","d values","viral RNA polymerase","antagonizing RIG","K309A","receptors","key participant","nucleocapsid assembly","compound screening","interferon","bp","Ebola viruses","functional analysis","\u03BCg","production","Insights","results"],"language":"en"},

A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology \u2013 Head \u0026 Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head \u0026 neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure. CONCLUSION: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible. Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy.

Influenza surveillance provides important information to inform policy on influenza control and vaccination. While the epidemiology of influenza has been well characterized in western countries, few data exist on influenza epidemiology in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. We describe the epidemiology of influenza virus in Oman. METHODS: Using syndromic case definitions and protocols, patients from four regional hospitals in Oman were enrolled in a descriptive prospective study to characterize the burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza. Eligible patients provided demographic information as well as oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Specimens were tested for influenza A and influenza B; influenza A viruses were subtyped using RT-PCR. RESULTS: From January 2008 through June 2013, a total of 5,147 cases were enrolled and tested for influenza. Influenza strains were detected in 8% of cases for whom samples were available. Annual incidence rates ranged from 0.5 to 15.4 cases of influenza-associated SARI per 100,000 population. The median age of influenza patients was 6 years with children 0\u20132 years accounting for 34% of all influenza-associated hospitalizations. By contrast, the median age of non-influenza SARI cases was 1 year with children 0\u20132 years comprising 59% of SARI. Compared to non-influenza SARI cases, a greater proportion of influenza cases had pre-existing chronic conditions and underwent ventilation during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus is associated with a substantial proportion of SARI in Oman. Influenza in Oman approximately follows northern hemisphere seasonality, with major peaks in October to December and a lesser peak around April. The burden of influenza was greatest in children and the elderly. Future efforts should examine the burden of influenza in other potential risk groups such as pregnant women to inform interventions including targeted vaccination.","publish_time":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Awaidy, Salah; Hamid, Sarah; Al Obaidani, Idris; Al Baqlani, Said; Al Busaidi, Suleiman; Bawikar, Shyam; El-Shoubary, Waleed; Dueger, Erica L.; Said, Mayar M.; Elamin, Emdeldin; Shah, Parag; Talaat, Maha","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd9b28a218d57ae7506637d96b2a396dca870e0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4671710.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Oman"],"keyphrases":["cases of influenza","burden of influenza","influenza epidemiology","Influenza surveillance","influenza control","influenza B","Influenza strains","epidemiology of influenza virus","influenza-associated hospitalizations","greater proportion of influenza cases","median age of influenza patients","median age of non-influenza SARI cases","associated SARI","Oman","substantial proportion of SARI","children","burden of severe acute respiratory infections","Eligible patients","years accounting","important information","demographic information","targeted vaccination","pregnant women","protocols","policy","northern hemisphere seasonality","potential risk groups","chronic conditions","syndromic case definitions","viruses","major peaks","interventions","descriptive prospective study","INTRODUCTION","regional hospitals","data","Eastern Mediterranean Region","leading cause of morbidity","NP","mortality","METHODS","ventilation","contrast","western countries","population","RT-PCR","Future efforts","Annual incidence rates","swabs","elderly","samples","total","CONCLUSIONS","lesser peak","Specimens","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe influenza infection from September 2013 through April 2014 in intensive care units at 33 U.S. hospitals comparing characteristics of cases with and without co-infection in bivariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Of 507 adult and pediatric patients, 114 (22.5%) developed bacterial co-infection and 23 (4.5%) developed viral co-infection. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of co-infection, isolated in 47 (9.3%) patients.

In the early 1990s an arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV), was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease. Since then research has progressed substantially. Most recently \u201Cporcine high fever disease\u201D was reported in China starting in 2006 with PRRSV being a critical virus associated with high morbidity and mortality (20%) associated with this syndrome which in 2010 is still causing severe pathology in pigs in China, with spread to Vietnam and Cambodia. This volume contains a series of reviews that highlight the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology, vaccinology and host genetic control. This paper provides a brief historical review of PRRS and the associated PRRSV. It presents areas of research gaps that inhibit current progress towards PRRS elimination through production of effective vaccines and current plans for PRRS elimination or eradication programs.

This study characterizes Type I IFN antagonism mechanism of NS5 protein, using proteomic approach. In human neuroblastoma cells, NS5 expression would suppress IFN\u03B2\u2010induced responses, for example, expression of IFN\u2010stimulated genes PKR and OAS as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis showed JEV NS5 downregulating calreticulin, while upregulating cyclophilin A, HSP 60 and stress\u2010induced\u2010phosphoprotein 1. Gene silence of calreticulin raised intracellular Ca(2\u002B) levels while inhibiting nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and NFAT\u20101 in response to IFN\u03B2, thus, indicating calreticulin downregulation linked with Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 via activation of Ca(2\u002B)/calicineurin.

Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide containing the sequence 5\u2032-U-G-A-3\u2032 through its inner pore surface, and its oligomerization and RNA binding properties are facilitated by two conformational changes when compared to monomeric VP40. The selective RNA interaction stabilizes the ring structure and confers in vitro SDS resistance to octameric VP40. SDS-resistant octameric VP40 is also found in Ebola virus-infected cells, which suggests that VP40 has an additional function in the life cycle of the virus besides promoting virus assembly and budding off the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2003-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomis-R\u00FCth, F.Xavier; Dessen, Andr\u00E9a; Timmins, Joanna; Bracher, Andreas; Kolesnikowa, Larissa; Becker, Stephan; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Weissenhorn, Winfried","journal":"Structure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/308335db4b2859ce167e8fa49eb72344008ffe01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126486.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212603000509","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDS"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["monomeric VP40","virus assembly","SDS-resistant octameric VP40","virus particles","disk-shaped octameric form of VP40","Ebola virus membrane-associated matrix protein VP40","Ebola virus-infected cells","RNA triribonucleotide","RNA binding properties","selective RNA interaction","ring structure","crystal structure","SDS resistance","plasma membrane","oligomerization","antiparallel homodimers","conformational changes","life cycle","sequence","additional function","N-terminal domain","inner pore surface","U-G"],"language":"en"},

A range of frontline government employees work to protect public health, providing services for people engaged in animal-based livelihoods (livestock owners and butchers), and enforcing meat safety and food premises standards. In contrast to literature which emphasises the inadequacy of extension support and food safety policy implementation in low- and middle-income countries, this paper foregrounds the \u2018street-level diplomacy\u2019 deployed by frontline actors operating in challenging contexts. METHODS: This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 61 government employees, including livestock extension officers/meat inspectors and health officers, across 10 randomly-selected rural and urban wards. RESULTS: Frontline actors combined formal and informal strategies including the leveraging of formal policy texts and relationships with other state employees, remaining flexible and recognising that poverty constrained people\u2019s ability to comply with health regulations. They emphasised the need to work with livestock keepers and butchers to build their knowledge to self-regulate and to work collaboratively to ensure meat safety. Remaining adaptive and being hesitant to act punitively unless absolutely necessary cultivated trust and positive relations, making those engaged in animal-based livelihoods more open to learning from and cooperating with extension officers and inspectors. This may result in higher levels of meat safety than might be the case if frontline actors stringently enforced regulations. CONCLUSION: The current tendency to view frontline actors\u2019 partial enforcement of meat safety regulations as a failure obscures the creative and proactive ways in which they seek to ensure meat safety in a context of limited resources. Their application of \u2018street-level diplomacy\u2019 enables them to be sensitive to local socio-economic realities, to respect local social norms and expectations and to build support for health safety interventions when necessary. More explicitly acknowledging the role of trust and positive state-society relations and the diplomatic skills deployed by frontline actors as a formal part of their inspection duties offers new perspectives and enhanced understandings on the complicated nature of their work and what might be done to support them.

METHODS: Twenty cats from 3.3\u201382 months of age (mean 10.4 months) with various forms of FIP were accepted into a field trial. Fourteen cats presented with wet or dry-to-wet FIP and six cats presented with dry FIP. GC376 was administered subcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Cats with neurologic signs were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. However, disease signs recurred 1\u20137 weeks after primary treatment and relapses and new cases were ultimately treated for a minimum of 12 weeks. Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1\u20137 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats had recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission. Five kittens aged 3.3\u20134.4 months with wet FIP were treated for 12 weeks and have been in disease remission after stopping treatment and at the time of writing for 5\u201314 months (mean 11.2 months). A sixth kitten was in remission for 10 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment, relapsed and is responding to a second round of GC376. The seventh was a 6.8-year-old cat with only mesenteric lymph node involvement that went into remission after three relapses that required progressively longer repeat treatments over a 10 month period. Side effects of treatment included transient stinging upon injection and occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis and hair loss. There was retarded development and abnormal eruption of permanent teeth in cats treated before 16\u201318 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GC376 showed promise in treating cats with certain presentations of FIP and has opened the door to targeted antiviral drug therapy.","publish_time":"2017-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Niels C; Kim, Yunjeong; Liu, Hongwei; Galasiti Kankanamalage, Anushka C; Eckstrand, Chrissy; Groutas, William C; Bannasch, Michael; Meadows, Juliana M; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11f3cdbb678b326042e1d0c38887a34a2177ddfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5871025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901812/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x17729626","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks of treatment","owned cats","weeks of initial treatment","repeat treatment","weeks of age","primary treatment","wet FIP","effects of treatment","dry FIP","disease remission","months of age","various forms of FIP","relapses","disease signs","round of GC376","certain presentations of FIP","protease inhibitor GC376","Severe neurologic disease","neurologic signs","time of writing","various forms of feline infectious peritonitis","injection","occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis","transient stinging","promise","abnormal eruption of permanent teeth","mesenteric lymph node involvement","outward health","cohort of client","year-old cat","retarded development","hair loss","new cases","door","recurrences of abdominal lesions","safety","efficacy","antiviral drug therapy","treatments","CONCLUSIONS","RELEVANCE","month period","OBJECTIVES","study","field trial","minimum","dose","kittens","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (CT) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. STUDY DESIGN: 582 children with ARI were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. Correlations were calculated between CT values and clinical parameters. RESULTS: In single viral ARI, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and hospitalization and between viral loads of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) and a disease severity score. In multiple-viral ARI, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. In RSV-Rhinovirus (RV) multiple infections, a low viral load of RV was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. The mean CT value for RV, HCoV and Parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single- versus multiple infections. CONCLUSION: Although correlations between CT values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-, viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings. In multiple infections, viral load cannot be used to differentiate between disease causing virus and innocent bystanders.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wishaupt, J\u00E9r\u00F4me O.; Ploeg, Tjeerd van der; Smeets, Leo C.; Groot, Ronald de; Versteegh, Florens G.A.; Hartwig, Nico G.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99c349da4a73a4ec5d11f640fe286abb6cdda88c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185604.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217300598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28259567/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.02.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217300598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple viral ARI","multiple-viral ARI","single viral ARI","multiple viral infection","low viral load of RV","multiple infections","viral loads of Respiratory Syncytial Virus","viral loads of Human Coronavirus","clinical parameters","significant correlations","CT values","clinical relevance","clinical importance","disease severity score","significant findings","mean CT value","HCoV","Parainfluenza virus","children","childhood acute respiratory tract infections","RSV-Rhinovirus","high length of hospital","high duration of extra oxygen use","value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays","patients","hospitalization","cycle threshold","host","interpretation","laboratory factors","individual differences","STUDY DESIGN","innocent bystanders","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","viruses"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine the viral and atypical bacterial causes of different severities and clinical manifestations of ARI in preschool children from low-income families in North-East Brazil. METHODS: Clinical/demographic data and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were prospectively collected from children \u003C5 years presenting with ARI over one year to a paediatric A\u0026E department. Disease severity was grouped according to presence of lower respiratory tract signs, need for hospital admission and need for oxygen. Clinical manifestation of ARI was based on discharge diagnosis from hospital with four conditions predominating: bronchiolitis, pneumonia, episodic viral wheeze/asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Multiplex PCR was used to detect 17 common respiratory viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in NPA. FINDINGS: 407 children with a median age of eight months were recruited. Pathogens were detected in 85\u00B75% samples with co-infection being particularly common (39\u00B75%). Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV; 37%), Adenoviruses (AdV; 25%), Rhinoviruses (hRV; 19%), Bocavirus (hBoV; 19%), human Meta-pneumovirus (hMPV; 10%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpp; 10%) were most prevalent. Detection and co-infection rates were similar in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI apart from RSV, which was associated with more severe disease and specifically more severe cases of bronchiolitis, and Mpp, which was associated with more severe cases of pneumonia. Mpp was detected in 17% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. INTERPRETATION: This study underlines the importance of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in ARI in pre-school children and highlights the complex epidemiology of these pathogens in this age group. Generally, viruses and atypical bacteria were detected in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI but RSV and Mpp were associated with more severe cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia respectively.","publish_time":"2011-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezerra, Patr\u00EDcia G.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them. IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.","publish_time":"2020-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Bei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Yang, Xing-Lou; Anderson, Danielle E.; Shi, Zheng-Li; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhou, Peng","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2952e4d56bd9bf5c6eee0aaa733557471e60a92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6992374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00807-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["genomes of bat CoVs","unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs","origin CoV","genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs","bat origin","bat coronaviruses","emergence of bat","CoV species","unbiased NGS","low-abundance CoV sequences","surveillance studies","high genetic diversity","great genetic diversity","capture-based NGS approach","IMPORTANCE Active surveillance","expensive methodology","surveillance field samples","baits","preferred methodology","generation sequencing","humans","high background level of nonviral sequences present","reduced sequencing costs","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","targeted PCR","SARS","study","virus discovery","common practice","MERS","chance of homologous recombination","future outbreaks","sensitivity of detection","technology","pandemics","livestock","hand","work","bats","century"],"language":"en"},

Influenza virus infection is initiated by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) through receptor binding and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to gain its fusion capacity. Although cleavage of HA is crucial for virus infectivity, little was known about relevant proteases in the human airways for a long time. Recent progress in the identification and characterization of HA-activating host cell proteases has been considerable however and supports the idea of targeting HA cleavage as a novel approach for influenza treatment. Interestingly, certain bacteria have been demonstrated to support HA activation either by secreting proteases that cleave HA or due to activation of cellular proteases and thereby may contribute to virus spread and enhanced pathogenicity. In this review, we give an overview on activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria with the main focus on recent progress on HA cleavage by proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 in the human airway epithelium. In addition, we outline investigations of HA-activating proteases as potential drug targets for influenza treatment.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00E4user, Eva; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang","journal":"Pathog Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ad87c53173f76b28afa3f95b8ff0fd693cc8039.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df8c159b3e52f7d49e4353add67b68844e2e7ec7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108517.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/2049-632x.12053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cleavage of HA","HA activation","characterization of HA","investigations of HA","proteases HAT","relevant proteases","secreting proteases","host cell proteases","activation of cellular proteases","idea of targeting HA cleavage","influenza treatment","Influenza virus infection","activation of influenza viruses","host cells","Recent progress","virus infectivity","human airways","fusion of viral","fusion capacity","acute infection","certain bacteria","human airway epithelium","main focus","TMPRSS2","receptor binding","novel approach","potential drug targets","surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin","respiratory tract","precursor protein","overview","identification","endosomal membranes","year millions of people","long time","enhanced pathogenicity","addition","review"],"language":"en"},

This approach was introduced widely in Southeast Asia (SEA) by the Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in the late 2000s. Aimed at addressing the problem of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), numerous such projects and activities have been generated throughout the region. Ecohealth is increasingly converging with the One Health approach, as both movements emphasise a holistic understanding to health. We conducted a scoping review by considering all of the Ecohealth programmes, initiatives and projects that have been implemented in SEA since the introduction of the approach, and also gathered information from peer-reviewed literature. The objective of this paper is to review Ecohealth activities within SEA over the last 10 years to address the lessons learned, challenges faced and the way forward for Ecohealth in the region. Activities range from those focusing purely on capacity, projects focusing on research and projects covering both. Achievements to date include, for example, research contributing to the field of infectious diseases in relation to social ecological factors and associated urbanisation and agricultural intensification. Challenges remain at the project design and implementation level, in the available capacity and coordination to develop Ecohealth research teams in the countries, gauging teams\u2019 assimilation of Ecohealth\u2019s underlying tenets and their translation into sustainable disease prevention and control, as well as in the ability to scale up Ecohealth projects.

While the importance of allergic responses in asthma is well known, respiratory viral and bacterial infections and pollutants especially cigarette smoke are important factors in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Corticosteroid treatment remains the first preference of treatment in either disease, however these therapies are not always completely effective, and are associated with side effects and steroid resistance. Due to such limitations, development of new treatments represents a major goal for both the pharmaceutical industry and academic researchers. There are now excellent reasons to promote NF-\u03BAB signalling intermediates and Rel family proteins as potential therapeutic targets for both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This notion is supported by the fact that much of the underlying inflammation of both diseases independent of stimuli, is mediated at least in part, by NF-\u03BAB mediated signalling events in several cell types. Also, a range of inhibitors of NF-\u03BAB signalling intermediates are now available, including DNA oligonucleotides and DNA-peptide molecules that act as NF-\u03BAB decoy sequences, small molecule inhibitors such as IKK-\u03B2 inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors affecting NF-\u03BAB signalling, that have either shown promise in animal models or have begun clinical trials in other disorders. This review will focus on the role of NF-\u03BAB in both diseases, will discuss its suitability as a target, and will highlight recent key studies that support the potential of NF-\u03BAB as a therapeutic target in these two important inflammatory lung diseases.","publish_time":"2008-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edwards, Michael R.; Bartlett, Nathan W.; Clarke, Deborah; Birrell, Mark; Belvisi, Maria; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"Pharmacol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8857e293f7343fb20ab2ab031e01eab7ce7f074.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172981.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725808001757; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725808001757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB signalling intermediates","potential of NF","NF-\u03BAB mediated signalling events","NF-\u03BAB decoy sequences","role of NF","Asthma","proteasome inhibitors","range of inhibitors","important inflammatory lung diseases","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","small molecule inhibitors","IKK-\u03B2 inhibitors","diseases independent of stimuli","inflammatory lung disorders responsible","potential therapeutic targets","DNA oligonucleotides","important factors","preference of treatment","Corticosteroid treatment","DNA-peptide molecules","pollutants","Rel family proteins","cigarette smoke","bacterial infections","significant morbidity","major goal","pharmaceutical industry","development of new treatments","underlying inflammation","cell types","animal models","clinical trials","mortality","recent key studies","pathogenesis","excellent reasons","academic researchers","limitations","importance of allergic responses","promise","effects","steroid resistance","therapies","suitability","notion","review"],"language":"en"},

In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof.

This is even more important, as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species. Nevertheless, infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. But the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between 2002 and 2009, 486 deceased bats of 19 European species (family Vespertilionidae) were collected in different geographic regions in Germany. Most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments. The bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically, bacteriologically and virologically. Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats. Comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases, with fatal bacterial, viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate the importance of diseases and infectious agents as cause of death in European bat species. The clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates indicate that maternity colonies are more susceptible to infectious agents, underlining the possible important role of host physiology, immunity and roosting behavior as risk factors for infection of bats.","publish_time":"2011-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FChldorfer, Kristin; Speck, Stephanie; Kurth, Andreas; Lesnik, Ren\u00E9; Freuling, Conrad; M\u00FCller, Thomas; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie; Wibbelt, Gudrun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/550494d6d01569a05a8ca2d75f892486b01d1865.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3247292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22216354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["infection of bats","deceased bats","impact of infectious agents","infectious diseases","various infectious agents","infectious disease studies","microbial agents","European species","European bat species","infection studies","individual host","reservoir species","mammalian species","disease prevalence","individual variations","importance of diseases","infection rates","important causes of death","individual cases","bat mortality","bat carcasses","possible important role of host physiology","roosting behavior","roosting sites","cause of death","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","investigated histo","Comparative analysis of pathological findings","immunity","complex social structures","capability of long distance dispersal","microbiological results","maternity colonies","risk factors","recognized status","increasing attention","human habitation","potential health threat","family Vespertilionidae","identification of specific pathogens","post-mortem examination","different geographic regions","way microbes","parasitic infections","data","Germany","humans","SIGNIFICANCE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODOLOGY","animals","environments","Trauma","date"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 has been shown to protect against lung injury. However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ARDS are largely unknown. Here, we report that ACE2 prevents LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting MAPKs and NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway. Lentiviral packaged Ace2 cDNA or Ace2 shRNA was intratracheally administrated into the lungs of male SD rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received LPS (7.5 mg/Kg) injection alone or in combination with Mas receptor antagonist A779 (10 \u03BCg/Kg) or ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (1 mg/Kg) pretreatment. LPS-induced lung injury and inflammatory response were significantly prevented by ACE2 overexpression and deteriorated by Ace2 shRNA. A779 or MLN-4760 pretreatment abolished the protective effects of ACE2. Moreover, overexpression of ACE2 significantly reduced the Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio in BALF and up-regulated Mas mRNA expression in lung, which was reversed by A779. Importantly, the blockade of ACE2 on LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and p50/p65 was also abolished by A779. Whereas, only the ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly attenuated lung injury in ACE2 overexpressing rats pretreated with A779. Our observation suggests that AEC2 attenuates LPS-induced ARDS via the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway by inhibiting ERK/NF-\u03BAB activation.","publish_time":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yingchuan; Zeng, Zhen; Cao, Yongmei; Liu, Yujing; Ping, Feng; Liang, Mengfan; Xue, Ying; Xi, Caihua; Zhou, Ming; Jiang, Wei","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47d93c4d0e435b2da5ebc11b4404ed209447f5a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4908402.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ace2 shRNA","ACE2 overexpression","overexpression of ACE2","blockade of ACE2","protective effects of ACE2","ACE2 inhibitor MLN","ACE2 overexpressing rats","LPS-induced ARDS","LPS-induced lung injury","Lentiviral packaged Ace2 cDNA","LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1","Ang","attenuated lung injury","Mas pathway","Mas receptor antagonist A779","pretreatment","NF-\u03BAB activation","regulated Mas mRNA expression","lungs of male SD rats","major challenge","\u03BCg","MAPKs","inflammatory response","severe sepsis","combination","intensive care medicine","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","p38","BALF","gene transfer","animals","AEC2","weeks","p50","p65","mechanisms","ratio","injection","observation"],"language":"en"},

Background The mass media is a key component of any public communication strategy for influenza or other respiratory illnesses, but coverage can be variable. In this study, we explored the factors that influenced journalists\u2019 coverage of avian influenza as a model for coverage of a potential influenza pandemic. Methods This study involved semi\u2010structured interviews with 16 journalists from major Australian print, radio and television media organisations reporting on avian influenza and pandemic planning. Journalists, including reporters, editors and producers, were interviewed between October 2006 and August 2007. Thematic analysis was used to draw out major lessons for health communicators. Results Coverage of avian influenza was influenced by a small set of news values: catastrophic potential, cultural and geographical proximity, unfamiliarity and uncertainty. Lack of novelty and the absence of compelling images led to a decline in coverage. Journalists expressed concerns about the accuracy and impacts of reporting, but saw as critically important, their primary role as informants. They hence emphasised the importance of journalistic independence. Journalists all intended to continue working in a pandemic. Conclusions Health experts need to adapt their timetables and resources to journalists\u2019 needs to improve their mutual communication. In crisis situations, journalists communicate with the public efficiently and effectively, but expert and journalistic views on the role and content of coverage may diverge in the post\u2010acute, reflective phase of a crisis.","publish_time":"2011-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hooker, Claire; King, Catherine; Leask, Julie","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5869f8b8ecda2894a0ac35dc2f50bf56f24e72f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941671.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00319.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22176678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["journalists\u2019 coverage of avian influenza","potential influenza pandemic","Results Coverage of avian influenza","potential pandemic","content of coverage","Journalists\u2019 views","pandemic planning","catastrophic potential","journalistic views","qualitative study","impacts of reporting","public communication strategy","major lessons","mass media","respiratory illnesses","primary role","mutual communication","health communicators","Respiratory Viruses","crisis situations","major Australian print","television media organisations","Conclusions Health experts","importance of journalistic independence","radio","geographical proximity","small set of news values","key component","semi\u2010structured interviews","model","absence of compelling images","unfamiliarity","reflective phase","Methods","timetables","accuracy","factors","Lack of novelty","uncertainty","informants","reporters","editors","concerns","decline","producers","Hooker","resources","Thematic analysis","paper"],"language":"en"},

Beside vaccination, the discovery of new anti-viral agents represents an important strategy to encounter seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains. The bacterial extra-cellular ribonuclease binase is a well-studied RNase from Bacillus pumilus. Treatment with binase was shown to improve survival of laboratory animals infected with different RNA viruses. Although binase reduced IAV titer in vitro and in vivo, the mode of action (MOA) of binase against IAV at the molecular level has yet not been studied in depth and remains elusive. METHODS: To analyze whether binase impairs virus replication by direct interaction with the viral particle we applied a hemagglutination inhibition assay and monitored the integrity of the viral RNA within the virus particle by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we used Western blot and confocal microscopy analysis to study whether binase can internalize into MDCK-II cells. By primer extension we examined the effect of binase on the integrity of viral RNAs within the cells and using a mini-genome system we explored the effect of binase on the viral expression. RESULTS: We show that (i) binase does not to attack IAV particle-protected viral RNA, (ii) internalized binase could be detected within the cytosol of MDCK-II cells and that (iii) binase impairs IAV replication by specifically degrading viral RNA species within the infected MDCK-II cells without obvious effect on cellular mRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our data provide novel evidence suggesting that binase is a potential anti-viral agent with specific intra-cellular MOA.

Commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy, especially in calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies (MDA). We previously reported that an experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, but not a commercial vaccine, induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with MDA, immunized at 7\u201315 weeks of age. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals, representing the target population for vaccination. Four groups of five 3\u20138 week old calves with variable levels of BRSV-specific MDA were immunized s.c. twice at a 3 weeks interval with (i) BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), (ii) BRSV-protein, (iii) adjuvant, or (iv) PBS. All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection. The cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs, the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge. Despite presence of MDA at the time of the immunization, only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the BRSV-ISCOM group after challenge. In contrast, in all control groups, clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals (respiratory rates up to 76min\u22121 and rectal temperatures up to 41\u00B0C). The clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves, rapid systemic and local antibody responses and T helper cell responses dominated by IFN\u03B3 production. Animals that did not shed virus detectable by PCR or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary IgA. The protective immunological responses to BRSV proteins and the ability to overcome the inhibiting effect of MDA were dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.","publish_time":"2011-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4gglund, Sara; Hu, Kefei; Vargmar, Karin; Por\u00E9, Lesly; Olofson, Ann-Sophie; Blod\u00F6rn, Krister; Anderson, Jenna; Ahooghalandari, Parvin; Pringle, John; Taylor, Geraldine; Valarcher, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93b2561f6153fa11b68d905215018f103aa31a17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115641.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1101303X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1101303X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864616/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDA","PBS"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["BRSV-specific","BRSV proteins","BRSV-ISCOMs","virulent BRSV","BRSV-protein","BRSV-ISCOM group","variable levels of BRSV","BRSV immunostimulating complexes","experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine","specific MDA","clinical protection","immune responses","humoral responses","challenge","clinical signs of disease","presence of MDA","minimum of clinical signs","lower respiratory tract of calves","virus detectable","local antibody responses","week old calves","protective immunological responses","inhibiting effect of MDA","T helper cell responses","Abstract Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory rates","younger animals","weeks interval","weeks of age","significant reduction of virus replication","cell culture","high morbidity","high levels of pulmonary IgA","virological protection","improvement of efficacy","control groups","Commercial vaccines","pneumonia","yearly outbreaks","cattle","PCR","ability","viral excretion","major cause of bronchiolitis","IFN\u03B3 production","derived antibodies","Europe","target population","immunization","present study","antigen presentation","pathology","time","safety","aerosol","adjuvant","rectal temperatures","aim","vaccination","contrast","day","PBS","infection"],"language":"en"},

There is currently no antiviral therapeutic or widely available vaccine against dengue infection. The DENV RNA genome is methylated on its 5\u2032 cap by its NS5 protein. DENV bearing a single E216A point mutation in NS5 loses 2\u2032-O-methylation of its genome. While this mutant DENV is highly attenuated and immunogenic, the mechanism of this attenuation has not been elucidated. In this study, we find that replication of this mutant DENV is attenuated very early during infection. This early attenuation is not dependent on a functional type I interferon response and coincides with early activation of the innate immune response. Taken together, our data suggest that 2\u2032-O-methylation of DENV genomic RNA is important for evasion of the host immune response during the very early stages of infection as the virus seeks to establish infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, David C.; Hoang, Long T.; Mohamed Naim, Ahmad Nazri; Dong, Hongping; Schreiber, Mark J.; Hibberd, Martin L.; Tan, Min Jie Alvin; Shi, Pei-Yong","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3db07b9f5f64b1cc4d148d5cc253c97d29aac41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172056.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216302835; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216302835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant DENV","DENV RNA genome","DENV genomic RNA","early attenuation","early stages of infection","dengue infection","early activation","interferon response","host immune response","innate immune response","virus pathogen","O-methylation","Abstract Dengue virus","NS5 protein","evasion","available vaccine","single E216A point mutation","functional type","prevalent mosquito","humans","mechanism","replication","cap","study","data"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03B2-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin \u201Cloop extrusion\u201D model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Zhilian; Li, Jingwei; Ge, Xiao; Wu, Yonghu; Guo, Ya; Wu, Qiang","journal":"Genome Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a02c9ea4d8034898c871804abe62183ad528d612.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293525/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-01984-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTCF","CRISPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single CTCF insulators","numerous CTCF sites","tandem CTCF topological insulators","distal directional CTCF sites","large arrays of tandem CTCF sites","enhancers","role of topological chromatin insulators","promoter activation","balanced promoter usage","Pcdh","promoter choice","promoters","distinct directional chromatin loops","long-range chromatin interactions","gene expression levels","single cells","D genome","proper enhancer insulation","balanced spatial contacts","stochastic monoallelic expression","\u03B2-globin clusters","genome-wide scale","developmental gene regulation","key insulator-binding protein","cell populations","mammalian genomes","immunoglobulin heavy chain","cohesin","interesting implications","genetic deletions","conjunction","Igh","dCas9","function","counter","chromosome conformation capture","CRISPR DNA-fragment","computational simulation","silico","findings","loop extrusion","protocadherin","RESULTS","model","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Neurosurgeons around the world are being affected in different ways. Objectives This is the first study regarding the readiness of neurosurgery residents towards the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. The aim is to identify the level of knowledge, readiness, and the impact of this virus among neurosurgery residents in different programs. Methods A cross-sectional analysis in which 52 neurosurgery residents from different centers were selected to complete a questionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire comprised of three sections and 27 questions that ranged from knowledge to impact of the current pandemic on various features. Results The median knowledge score was 4 out of 5. The proportion of participants with satisfactory knowledge level was 60%. There was a statistically significant difference between the knowledge score and location of the program. Around 48% of the neurosurgery residents dealt directly with COVID-19 patients. Receiving a session about personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported by 57.7%. The neurosurgery training at the hospital was affected. About 90% believed that this pandemic influenced their mental health. Conclusion Neurosurgery residents have a relatively good knowledge about COVID-19. The location of the program was associated with knowledge level. Most of the participants did not receive a sufficient training about PPE. Almost all responders agree that their training at the hospital was affected. Further studies are needed to study the impact of this pandemic on neurosurgery residents.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alhaj, Ahmad Kh.; Al-Saadi, Tariq; Mohammad, Fadil; Alabri, Said","journal":"World neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3bae4f5fdfa1087faad4cd07d2149d09fc1d949.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020310585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020310585?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion Neurosurgery","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["readiness of neurosurgery residents","level of knowledge","neurosurgery training","Conclusion Neurosurgery residents","impact","COVID","good knowledge","satisfactory knowledge level","median knowledge score","current pandemic","different programs","different centers","PPE","different ways","sufficient training","location","study","hospital","proportion of participants","mental health","health-care workers","questionnaire-based survey","novel Coronavirus disease","Abstract Background","challenge","session","personal protective equipment","cross-sectional analysis","various features","significant difference","world","questions","life-threatening illness","Methods","sections","Neurosurgeons","Objectives","responders","aim","patients","studies"],"language":"en"},

Housing patients in a separate room provides a barrier which minimises any physical contact with other patients. An isolation room held at negative pressure to reduce aerosol escape and a high air-change rate to allow rapid removal of aerosols can eliminate transmission of infectious aerosols to those outside the room. However, badly designed and/or incorrectly operating isolation rooms have been shown to place healthcare workers and other patients at risk from airborne diseases such as tuberculosis. Few standards are available for the design of isolation rooms and no pressure differential or air-change rates are specified. Techniques such as aerosol particle tracer sampling and computational fluid dynamics can be applied to study the performance of negative-pressure rooms and to assess how design variables can affect their performance. This should allow cost-effective designs for isolation rooms to be developed. Healthcare staff should be trained to understand how these rooms operate and there should be systems in place to ensure they are functioning correctly.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, J.

Two open reading frames, ORFs 1a and 1b, resided in the first two thirds of the genome, and nine additional downstream ORFs were identified. A gene for hemagglutinin-esterase was absent in TCoV. The region between the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes contained three potential small ORFs: ORF-X, a previously uncharacterized ORF with an associated putative TRS within the M gene (apparently shared among all group III coronaviruses), and previously described ORFs 5a and 5b.

Here, we investigated shifts of the bacterial microbiota in saliva, urine and faeces during the seasonal reproduction of bats in South Africa, and test for an interaction in shedding patterns of both bacterial (Leptospira) and viral (adeno- and herpesviruses) agents. Based on a comparative approach in two cave-dwelling bat species and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we demonstrated a clear signature in microbiota changes over the reproduction season, consistent across the multiple body habitats investigated, and associated with the sex, age and reproductive condition of bats. We observed in parallel highly dynamic shedding patterns for both bacteria and viruses, but did not find a significant association between viral shedding and bacterial microbiota composition. Indeed, only Leptospira shedding was associated with alterations in both the diversity and composition of the urinary microbiota. These results illustrate how seasonal reproduction in bats substantially affects microbiota composition and infection dynamics, and have broad implications for the understanding of disease ecology in important reservoir hosts, such as bats.","publish_time":"2018-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dietrich, Muriel; Kearney, Teresa; Seamark, Ernest C.

This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K(\u002B) channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization. By inhibiting the background K(\u002B) currents, Vpu dissipates the voltage constraint on viral particle discharge. As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone.

Here, we focus on recent applications of microarray technology in understanding the detailed chemical biology of immune responses to disease in an effort to guide development of vaccines and other protective therapies.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maynard, Jennifer A; Myhre, Ryan; Roy, Benjamin","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e495c58555041ead0172b121b4388f301970f1f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108391.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136759310700049X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S136759310700049X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease","recent applications of microarray technology","genetic analysis","functional analysis","initial applications of DNA microarrays","recent efforts","detailed chemical biology of immune responses","gene expression patterns","molecules","interplay","development of vaccines","prognostic of cancer","internet","peptides","identification of immunodominant antigens","scientific world","prime application","role of post-translational glycosylation","protective therapies","past decade","everyday life"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a core component of PDCoV, is essential for virus replication and is a significant candidate in the development of diagnostics for PDCoV. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and tested for reactivity with three truncations of the full protein (N1, N2, N3) that contained partial overlaps; of the five monoclonals chosen tested, each reacted with only the N3 truncation. The antibody designated 4E88 had highest binding affinity with the N protein and was chosen for in-depth examination. The 4E88 epitope was located to amino acids 308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318 by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of N3 truncations, then the minimal epitope, 309-KPKQQKKPK-317 (designated EP-4E88), was pinpointed by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of synthetic peptides of this region. Homology analysis showed that the EP-4E88 sequence is highly conserved among PDCoV strains, and also shares high similarity with sparrow coronavirus (HKU17), Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV), quail coronavirus (UAE-HKU30), and sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV). Of note, the PDCoV EP-4E88 sequence shared very low similarity (\u003C22.2%) with other porcine coronaviruses (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV), demonstrating that it is an epitope that can be used for distinguishing PDCoV and other porcine coronavirus. 3D structural analysis revealed that amino acids of EP-4E88 were in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the N protein.","publish_time":"2020-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Jiayu; Chen, Rui; Hu, Jingfei; Qu, Huan; Zhao, Yujia; Cao, Sanjie; Wen, Xintian; Wen, Yiping; Wu, Rui; Zhao, Qin; Ma, Xiaoping; Huang, Xiaobo","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7013544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31963776/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21020648","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["4E88 monoclonal","4E88 epitope","PDCoV EP-4E88 sequence","designated EP-4E88","antibody designated 4E88","N protein","PDCoV strains","distinguishing PDCoV","sparrow coronavirus","reactivity","amino acids of EP","core component of PDCoV","quail coronavirus","Porcine deltacoronavirus","series of N3 truncations","sparrow deltacoronavirus","porcine coronaviruses","minimal epitope","monoclonal antibodies","Asian leopard cat coronavirus","high similarity","low similarity","Homology analysis","series of synthetic peptides","D structural analysis","HKU17","ALCCoV","highest binding affinity","PRCV","TGEV","significant candidate","PEDV","virus replication","UAE-HKU30","SADS-CoV","development of diagnostics","N2","N1","partial overlaps","PHEV","region","study","mAbs","close proximity","AKPKQQKKPKK","note","in-depth examination","swine enteropathogen","countries","monoclonals","SpDCoV","surface","nucleocapsid"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation. Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as aMC stabilizer, prevents the release ofinflammatorychemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide(PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenousfatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gigante, Antonio; Aquili, Alberto; Farinelli, Luca; Caraffa, Alessandro; Ronconi, Gianpaolo; Enrica Gallenga, Carla; Tet\u00E8, Giulia; Kritas, Spyros K.; Conti, Pio","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff9267dfa442a46bc98e5e983a8032991931bd51.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720310410?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109856; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720310410","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR","SCG","PEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MCs activation","MC viral activation","lung viral infection","respiratory tract infection","MC activation","MCs homeostasis","pulmonary inflammation","chronic inflammation","SARS-CoV","pathogenesis of viral infections","pro-inflammatory mediators release","chemical pro-inflammatory compounds","production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","PEA","SCG","causes Covid","respiratory pathological changes","release ofinflammatorychemical compounds","immune cells","Mast cells","inflamed lung of patients","novel human coronavirus SARS","mouse survival","nuclear factor agonist","anti-inflammatory therapeutic role","protective effect","disease","TLR","endogenousfatty acid amide","aMC stabilizer","reports","variety of biological effects","specific antiviral treatment","Sodium Chromo-Glycate","palmitoylethanolamide","pain","biomedical literature","date","deaths","Microbes","fibrosis","year","time"],"language":"en"},

We allow for multiple facilities, such as acute care hospitals or long-term care facilities and nursing homes, and for multiple units or wards within a facility. Patient transfers between units and facilities are tracked and accounted for in the models so that direct importation of a colonized individual from one facility or unit to another might be inferred.

CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5\u2032-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wild-type\u2212infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33bf989feabff5e78b735d5b00fd210382df755e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149396.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921485117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["termed PUN RNA","transfecting PUN RNA","target of EndoU activity","higher abundance of PUN RNA","templated RNA synthesis","negative-sense viral RNA","positive-sense RNA viruses","CoVs","endoribonuclease designated EndoU","EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation","CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen","MDA5-dependent interferon response","PAMP","evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5","molecular pattern","infected cells","emerging CoV infections","therapeutic interventions","removal","cytoplasm","product of polyA","polyuridines","wild-type","approach","polyuridine extension","endemic reservoirs","study","significant morbidity","mortality","Coronaviruses","results","accumulation","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

In 2001, a new respiratory pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified in respiratory secretions. hMPV is an RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, and it has been isolated on every continent and from individuals of all ages. hMPV causes 7 to 19% of all cases of ARTIs in both hospitalized and outpatient children, and the rate of detection in adults is approximately 3%. Symptoms of hMPV infection range from a mild cold to a severe disease requiring a ventilator and cardiovascular support. The main risk factors for severe disease upon hMPV infection are the presence of a high viral load, coinfection with other agents (especially human respiratory syncytial virus), being between 0 and 5 months old or older than 65 years, and immunodeficiency. Currently, available treatments for hMPV infections are only supportive, and antiviral drugs are employed in cases of severe disease as a last resort. Ribavirin and immunoglobulins have been used in some patients, but the real efficacy of these treatments is unclear. At present, the direction of research on therapy for hMPV infection is toward the development of new approaches, and a variety of vaccination strategies are being explored and tested in animal models. However, further studies are required to define the best treatment and prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Mastrolia, Maria Vincenza","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbca9364696cc63d022eeeb97d6fb49b514c519c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171707.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1584800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27486733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hMPV infections","Symptoms of hMPV infection range","cases of severe disease","respiratory secretions","new respiratory pathogen","human respiratory syncytial virus","Acute respiratory tract infections","cases of ARTIs","ages","human metapneumovirus","RNA virus","available treatments","prevention strategies","development of new approaches","variety of vaccination strategies","agents","presence","mild cold","high viral load","coinfection","main risk factors","direction of research","years","real efficacy","antiviral drugs","ventilator","therapy","rate of detection","best treatment","outpatient children","common illnesses","cardiovascular support","patients","months old","people","Paramyxoviridae family","immunoglobulins","adults","immunodeficiency","present","continent","individuals","resort","animal models","Ribavirin","studies"],"language":"en"},

Some members of the Caliciviridae, i.e. human pathogenic norovirus or rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), are worldwide emerging pathogens. The norovirus is the major cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, accounting for about 85% of the outbreaks in Europe between 1995 and 2000. In the United States, 25 million cases of infection are reported each year. Since its emergence in 1984 as an agent of fatal hemorrhagic diseases in rabbits, RHDV has killed millions of rabbits and has been dispersed to all of the inhabitable continents. In view of their successful and apparently increasing emergence, the development of antiviral strategies to control infections due to these viral pathogens has now become an important issue in medicine and veterinary medicine. Antiviral strategies have to be based on an understanding of the epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms, viral replication and immunity to infection resulting from infection by these viruses. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying calicivirus infection, focusing on the molecular aspects of replication in the host cell. Recent experimental data generated through an international collaboration on structural biology, virology and drug design within the European consortium VIZIER is also presented. Based on this analysis, we propose antiviral strategies that may significantly impact on the epidemiological characteristics of these highly successful viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohayem, Jacques; Bergmann, Mirko; Gebhardt, Julia; Gould, Ernest; Tucker, Paul; Mattevi, Andrea; Unge, Torsten; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1c9ef0b447ecd57ec2317ba4bc4c9d6c4733289.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114105.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210006054; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210006054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European consortium VIZIER"],"locations":["Europe","United States"],"keyphrases":["viral replication","successful viral pathogens","cases of infection","calicivirus infection","human pathogenic norovirus","development of antiviral strategies","non-human pathogenic viruses","RHDV","emerging pathogens","emergence","major cause of viral gastroenteritis","Abstract Caliciviridae","veterinary medicine","millions of rabbits","hemorrhagic disease virus","molecular aspects of replication","agent of fatal hemorrhagic diseases","drug design","virology","international collaboration","structural biology","transmission","clinical symptoms","immunity","important issue","infections","European consortium VIZIER","high diversity","epidemiology","Recent experimental data","host cell","epidemiological characteristics","overview","mechanisms","accounting","United States","understanding","year","members","analysis","inhabitable continents","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

The use of nanoparticles in vaccinology is inspired by the fact that most pathogens have a dimension within the nano-size range and therefore can be processed efficiently by the immune system, which leads to a potent immune response. Herein, we report a facile approach to increase antigen size to achieve not only fast but also effective responses against the recombinant HA/H7N9 protein via a simple conjugation of the protein onto the surface of nanodiamond particles. RESULTS: In this study, trimeric Haemagglutinin (H7) that is transiently expressed in N. benthamiana was purified using affinity chromatography, and its trimeric state was revealed successfully by the cross-linking reaction. The trimeric H7 solution was subsequently mixed with a nanodiamond suspension in different ratios. The successful conjugation of the trimeric H7 onto the surface of nanodiamond particles was demonstrated by the changes in size and Zeta-potential of the particles before and after protein coating, Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and Western-blot analysis. Next, biofunction of the protein-nanodiamond conjugates was screened using a haemagglutination assay. A mixture containing 5 \u00B5g of trimeric H7 and 60 \u00B5g of nanodiamond corresponds to a ratio of 1:12 (w/w) of agglutinated chicken red blood cells at HA titer of 1024, which is 512-fold higher than the HA titer of free trimeric H7. After the 2nd and 3rd immunization in mice, ELISA and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the physical mixture of trimeric H7 protein and nanodiamond (1:12, w/w) elicited statistically significant stronger H7-specific-IgG response demonstrated by higher amounts of H7N9-specific IgG (over 15.4-fold with P \u003C 0.05 after the second immunization). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated a potential effect inherent to nanodiamond towards modulating immune systems, which should be further evaluated and broadly applied in nanovaccine development.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, Ngoc Bich; Ho, Thuong Thi; Nguyen, Giang Thu; Le, Thuy Thi; Le, Ngoc Thu; Chang, Huan-Cheng; Pham, Minh Dinh; Conrad, Udo; Chu, Ha Hoang","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac6bfed80dfd9922eeb3124fe302d0a7b29997d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5629800.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-017-0305-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5g of trimeric H7","trimeric H7 solution","H7N9 protein","\u00B5g of nanodiamond","physical mixture of trimeric H7 protein","protein-nanodiamond conjugates","HA titer of free trimeric H7","nanodiamond suspension","surface of nanodiamond particles","trimeric state","trimeric Haemagglutinin","protein coating","significant stronger H7-specific","higher amounts of H7N9","specific IgG","recombinant HA","IgG response","emerged H7N9 virus","antigen size","potent immune response","RESULTS","immune systems","immunization","fold","Western blot analyses","Western-blot analysis","nano-size range","effective responses","Zeta-potential","simple conjugation","human transmission","effective vaccine","possibility of human","successful conjugation","potential effect inherent","Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","agglutinated chicken red blood cells","SDS-PAGE","dimension","China","numerous efforts","mice","ELISA","changes","continuing spread","poultry","affinity chromatography","study","vaccinology","fact","pathogens","facile approach","different ratios","biofunction","haemagglutination assay","use of nanoparticles","benthamiana","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","cross-linking reaction","nanovaccine development"],"language":"en"},

Collectively, this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immunity, which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASD-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Zhihai; Sun, Yuan; Yan, Xiaoling; Tang, Xiaoyu; Li, Qianniu; Tan, Yaorong; Lan, Tian; Ma, Jingyun","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6525bc180629aca4b0760e0ff9f187f2e2a6fec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884203/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219305738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197843; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219305738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SADS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SADS-CoV infection","SASD-CoV infection","IFN-\u03B2 production","\u03B2 promoter","triggered IFN-\u03B2 expression","activity of IFN","Interactions","study","Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","host innate immunity","inhibited poly","induced phosphorylation","emerging enteric coronavirus","model","information","SeV","nuclear translocation of IRF","IRF3","molecular mechanisms","potential evasion strategies","Sendai virus","IPEC-J2 cells","TBK1","immune response","economic losses","porcine industry","IKK\u03B5","investigation","results","NF-\u03BAB","IPS","activation","RIG-"],"language":"en"},

Here we performed a large-scale community study across multiple age groups to assess the pathogenicity of 18 respiratory viruses. We enrolled 214 individuals at multiple New York City locations and tested weekly for respiratory viral pathogens, irrespective of symptom status, from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined these test results with participant-provided daily records of cold and flu symptoms and used this information to characterise symptom severity by virus and age category. Asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70% for most viruses, excepting influenza and human metapneumovirus, which produced significantly more severe outcomes. Symptoms were negatively associated with infection frequency, with children displaying the lowest score among age groups. Upper respiratory manifestations were most common for all viruses, whereas systemic effects were less typical.

Consequently, changes in the affinity or quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on either the bone marrow stroma or the blood cell precursor component \u2014during normal development or due to activation or a malignant process \u2014will affect cell attachment. Adhesion molecules, therefore, are modulator molecules which alter the biological behavior of normal or leukemic hematopoietic cells, primarily in terms of migration and localization properties, although they also participate in many other cell functions such as cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and binding of viruses or cancer cells. Several membrane-bound adhesion molecules and, in some instances, their soluble counterparts which may be biologically active, have been described in acute myeloid leukemia.

Methods To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios.

The largest known outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015. As of 29 June 2016, 1769 laboratory-confirmed cases (630 deaths; 35.6 % case fatality rate [CFR]) had been reported from 26 countries, particularly in the Middle East. However, the CFR for hospital outbreaks was higher than that of family clusters in the Middle East and Korea. Here, we compared the mortality rates for 51 nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East and one outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea. Our findings showed the CFR in the Middle East was much higher than that in South Korea (25.9 % [56/216] vs. 13.8 % [24/174], p = 0.003). Infected individuals who died were, on average, older than those who survived in both the Middle East (64 years [25\u201398] vs. 46 years [2\u201385], p = 0.000) and South Korea (68 years [49\u201382] vs. 53.5 years [16\u201387], p = 0.000). Similarly, the co-morbidity rates for the fatal cases were statistically higher than for the nonfatal cases in both the Middle East (64.3 % [36/56] vs. 28.1 % [45/160], p = 0.000) and South Korea (45.8 % [11/24] vs. 12.0 % [18/150], p = 0.000). The median number of days from onset to confirmation of infection in the fatal cases was longer than that for survivors from the Middle East (8 days [1\u201347] vs. 4 days [0\u201314], p = 0.009). Thus, older age, pre-existing concurrent diseases, and delayed confirmation increase the odds of a fatal outcome in nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea.

We conducted a prospective observational study of 43 children hospitalized with febrile UTI. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at admission and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by nucleic acid detection methods. Respiratory symptoms were recorded, and blood MxA levels were determined. The median age of study children was 4 months (interquartile range, 2\u201314 months). A respiratory virus was detected in 17 (40%) children with febrile UTI. Of the virus-positive children with febrile UTI, 7 (41%) had simultaneous respiratory symptoms.

In addition to the cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N, the TGEV spike protein binds to sialic acid residues.

This was shown by performing a virus overlay binding assay with proteins obtained from brush border membranes by lectin precipitation. Because of the reactivity with specific lectins we assume that the recognized glycoprotein has the characteristics of a mucin.","publish_time":"2007-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Herrler, Georg","journal":"SARS- and Other Coronaviruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f008210fdb1eedaa6711b6fa45650c02a7eb9d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122611.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-181-9_22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19057868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of TGEV","porcine brush border membranes","sialic acid binding activity","mucin","virus overlay binding assay","porcine aminopeptidase N","sialic acid residues","porcine small intestine","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","TGEV spike protein binds","glycoprotein present","recognized glycoprotein","viral gastroenteritis","proteins","cellular receptor","diarrhea","lectin precipitation","group","specific lectins","age","addition","characteristics","intestinal tract","weeks","reactivity","Coronaviruses","Piglets","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

The malaria pigment\u2010hemozoin (Hz) is associated with severe anemia, cytokine dysfunction, and immunosuppression, thus making it an interesting target for developing new strategies for antimalarial therapy. Monocytes (MO) in circulation actively ingest Hz released by Plasmodium parasites and secrete pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines. M1 and M2 types represent the two major forms of MO/macrophages (MQ) with distinct phenotypes and opposing functions. Imbalance in the polarization of these types is reported in many infectious diseases. Though the association of Hz with immunosuppression is well documented, its role in activation of MO in context of M1/M2 phenotypes remains to be addressed. We report here that natural Hz drives human MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype as evidenced by the expression of M2 signature markers. Hz\u2010fed MO showed elevated transcript and secreted level of IL\u201010, CCL17, CCL1, expression of mannose\u2010binding lectin receptor (CD206), and arginase activity. Hz attenuated HLA\u2010DR expression, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species production, which are the features of M1 phenotype.

In addition, we have previously shown that TRIM22 is a direct target gene for the tumour suppressor p53. Consistently, over\u2010expression of TRIM22 inhibits the clonogenic growth of monoblastic U937 cells, suggesting anti\u2010proliferative or cell death\u2010inducing effects. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that TRIM22 directly or indirectly interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E, and inhibits the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, thus disturbing the assembly of the eIF4F complex, which is necessary for cap\u2010dependent translation. Furthermore, TRIM22 exerts a repressive effect on luciferase reporter protein levels and to some extent on radiolabelled methionine incorporation. Even though all nuclear mRNAs are capped, some are more dependent on eIF4F than others for translation. The translation of one of these mRNAs, IRF\u20107C, was indeed found to be repressed in the presence of TRIM22. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest TRIM22 to repress protein translation preferably of some specific mRNAs. Taken together, we show that TRIM22 represses translation by inhibiting the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of protein translation, which may be of importance in response to p53 and/or IFN signalling.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersson, Jessica; Ageberg, Malin; Sand\u00E9n, Carl; Olofsson, Tor; Gullberg, Urban; Drott, Kristina","journal":"Biol Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/785e8ce9ed0cb3c8066c30c00d2c3629eeaee2e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22509910/; https://doi.org/10.1111/boc.201100099","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of protein translation","inducible protein TRIM22","dependent translation","presence of TRIM22","protein ubiquitylation","over\u2010expression of TRIM22","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","luciferase reporter protein levels","tripartite motif protein family","eIF4G","binding of eIF4E","specific mRNAs","nuclear mRNAs","IFN signalling","eIF4F complex","tumour suppressor p53","regulation of viral replication","clonogenic growth of monoblastic U937 cells","extent","member","repressive effect","direct target gene","interferon","mechanism","cell death","role","cap","Staf50","data","radiolabelled methionine incorporation","effects","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","assembly","response","importance","IRF","CONCLUSIONS","addition","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the immune activation in HFMD patients, 8 cytokines and IgM antibodies to EV71 and CA16 from mild and severe patients were detected. Our results indicated that the severity of HFMD may affect the pathogen detection. The lower positive rates of enterovirus and respiratory viruses in severe HFMD cases by RT-PCR were probably related to stronger immune response. Therefore, immunological tests such as ELISA are essential supplements to PCR or RT-PCR in order to increase pathogen diagnosis in HFMD, especially in severe cases.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Dong; Zhao, Xiu-Ying; Yao, Yao; Dai, Fang-Fang; He, Han; Li, Run-Qing; Jin, Rong-Hua; Liang, Lian-Chun; Li, Ning","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b5988df3808813c14e5898f7642f5c32cbc148d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535205/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.02.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889313001077; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889313001077","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR","HFMD patients","severe HFMD cases","severity of HFMD","severe patients","reverse transcriptase PCR","severe cases","pathogen detection","CA16","EV71","pathogen diagnosis","study","respiratory viruses","immune activation","different respiratory pathogens","stronger immune response","lower positive rates of enterovirus","nasopharyngeal swabs","foot","probable coinfection factors","hand","polymerase chain reaction","IgM antibodies","cytokines","essential supplements","order","ELISA","novel information","mouth disease","immunological tests","coxsackievirus A16","results"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. RESULTS: Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue. Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thamboo, Andrew; Lea, Jane; Sommer, Doron D.; Sowerby, Leigh; Abdalkhani, Arman; Diamond, Christopher; Ham, Jennifer; Heffernan, Austin; Cai Long, M.; Phulka, Jobanjit; Wu, Yu Qi; Yeung, Phillip; Lammers, Marc","journal":"J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84da609a6da8cac25772d5533760bfb8d7a43cbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202463.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00425-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["categories of potential AGMPs","risk of airborne transmission","airborne transmission of pathogens","medical procedures","Tracheal procedures","droplet transmission","literature review","text of included studies","electrocautery","endotracheal suctioning","tracheostomy","evidence-based recommendations","Indirect evidence","formal review","abstracts of retrieved studies","pandemic","COVID","use of high-speed rotating devices","Cochrane Review databases","CO2 lasers","special care","Nasal endoscopy","nasal packing","literature search","CO2 laser ablation","health care workers","present risks","epistaxis management","Medline","Neck Surgery","Otolaryngology - Head","Embase","small virus","aerosols","reviewers","appropriate infection prevention precautions","titles","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","HCWs","infected tissue","METHODS","quality","aim","CONCLUSIONS","category"],"language":"en"},

Ten years later, a second highly pathogenic human CoV, MERS-CoV, emerged in the Middle East and has spread to other countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and Asia. As of November 2017, MERS-CoV had infected at least 2102 people with a fatality rate of about 35% globally, and hence there is an urgent need to identify antiviral drugs that are active against MERS-CoV. Here we show that a clinically available alcohol-aversive drug, disulfiram, can inhibit the papain-like proteases (PLpros) of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our findings suggest that disulfiram acts as an allosteric inhibitor of MERS-CoV PLpro but as a competitive (or mixed) inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro. The phenomenon of slow-binding inhibition and the irrecoverability of enzyme activity after removing unbound disulfiram indicate covalent inactivation of SARS-CoV PLpro by disulfiram, while synergistic inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro by disulfiram and 6-thioguanine or mycophenolic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinically available drugs.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Min-Han; Moses, David C.; Hsieh, Chih-Hua; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Chen, Yau-Hung; Sun, Chiao-Yin; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/160cb8147411f180afff364529059a74571137d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113793.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217306101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289665/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217306101; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East","Europe","North Africa","North America","Asia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","CoV PLpro","pathogenic human CoV","unbound disulfiram","inhibitor of SARS","disulfiram acts","synergistic inhibition of MERS","allosteric inhibitor of MERS","covalent inactivation of SARS","available drugs","fatality rate","North Africa","binding inhibition","North America","antiviral drugs","available alcohol-aversive drug","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","irrecoverability of enzyme activity","potential","mycophenolic acid","combination treatments","Europe","thioguanine","countries","global outbreak","Asia","PLpros","phenomenon of slow","southern China","urgent need","papain","proteases","people","Middle East","findings","years"],"language":"en"},

It is essential to establish a sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay to understand the epidemiology of Vaccinia-specific immunity in current populations in China. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A new anti-Vaccinia virus (VACV) neutralization assay that used the attenuated replication-competent VTT carrying the firefly luciferase gene of Photinus pyralis (rTV-Fluc) was established and standardized for critical parameters that included the choice of cell line, viral infection dose, and the infection time. The current study evaluated the maintenance of virus-specific immunity after smallpox vaccination by conducting a non-randomized, cross-sectional analysis of antiviral antibody-mediated immune responses in volunteers examined 30\u201355 years after vaccination. The rTV-Fluc neutralization assay was able to detect neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against Vaccinia virus without the ability to differentiate strains of Vaccinia virus. We showed that the neutralizing titers measured by our assay were similar to those obtained by the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Using this assay, we found a low prevalence of NAb to VTT (7.6%) in individuals born before 1980 from Beijing and Anhui provinces in China, and when present, anti-VTT NAb titers were low. No NAbs were detected in all 222 samples from individuals born after 1980. There was no significant difference observed for titer or prevalence by gender, age range and geographic origin. CONCLUSION: A simplified, sensitive, standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput assay was developed for the quantitation of NAbs against different Vaccinia strains. The current study provides useful insights for the future development of VTT-based vaccination in Beijing and Anhui provinces of China.","publish_time":"2012-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qiang; Huang, Weijin; Nie, Jianhui; Zhu, Rong; Gao, Dongying; Song, Aijing; Meng, Shufang; Xu, Xuemei; Wang, Youchun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba3f5979fe991711ff096116b05cdb182ef3aeab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3306400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438922/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033392","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing","Anhui"],"keyphrases":["strains of Vaccinia virus","anti-VTT","new anti-Vaccinia virus","epidemiology of Vaccinia","application of VTT","high-throughput neutralization assay","rTV-Fluc neutralization assay","high-throughput assay","Vaccinia Tian Tan virus","maintenance of virus","smallpox vaccination","different Vaccinia strains","based vaccination","future development of VTT","Anhui provinces of China","specific immunity","current study","attenuated replication-competent VTT","Pre-existing immunity","Beijing","large vaccination campaign","current populations","low prevalence","neutralizing titers","individuals","traditional plaque reduction neutralization test","infection time","neutralizing antibodies","viral infection dose","firefly luciferase gene of Photinus pyralis","cross-sectional analysis of antiviral antibody","gender","choice of cell line","VACV","age range","useful insights","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","PRNT","quantitation","present","ability","immune responses","major issue","volunteers","geographic origin","vector","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","significant difference","vaccines","critical parameters","CONCLUSION","years","samples"],"language":"en"},

PEDV shares some important characteristics with two major pandemic viruses (porcine reproductive and respiratory virus; porcine circovirus type 2) of pigs that have high rates of mutation and high host specificity, and appear to have been present in the swine virome for decades prior to emerging to cause severe clinical disease. A unique feature of the PEDV in North America has been the implication of feed as a vehicle for transmission, with particular concerns related to ingredients of porcine origin.

I address this gap by proposing and testing a bipartite theory that can explain inconsistent results regarding the previously assumed linear association between videogames and gun-related behaviors. The theory suggests that this association follows a U-shape. It posits that at low levels of video gaming time, video gaming displaces gun-related behaviors and shelters adolescents by keeping them occupied and by reducing opportunities and motivation to acquire guns. However, at some level of gaming time (because most popular games adolescents play include violent aspects), the assumed imprinting of aggressive behaviors overpowers the positive displacement force, and this can trivialize and naturalize gun-carrying behaviors, and ultimately increase motivation to obtain and carry guns. I tested this theory with two national samples of American adolescents (n1 = 24,779 and n2 = 26,543, out of which 403 and 378, respectively, reported bringing a gun to school in the last month). Multiple analyses supported the proposed U-shaped association.

Our recent study demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) infection of monkey kidney Vero E6 cells induces phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling pathways, resulting in apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation status of p90RSK, which is a well-known substrate of these signaling pathways, in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Vero E6 mainly expressed p90RSK1 and showed weak expression of p90RSK2. In the absence of viral infection, Ser221 in the N-terminal kinase domain was phosphorylated constitutively, whereas both Thr573 in the C-terminal kinase domain and Ser380 between the two kinase domains were not phosphorylated in confluent cells. Ser380, which has been reported to be involved in autophosphorylation by activation of the C-terminal kinase domain, was phosphorylated in confluent SARS-CoV-infected cells, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by SB203580, which is an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Phosphorylation of Thr573 was not upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Thus, in virus-infected cells, phosphorylation of Thr573 was not necessary to induce phosphorylation of Ser380. On the other hand, Both Thr573 and Ser380 were phosphorylated by treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the absence of p38 MAPK activation. Ser220 was constitutively phosphorylated despite infection. These results indicated that phosphorylation status of p90RSK by SARS-CoV infection is different from that by stimulation of EGF. This is the first detailed report regarding regulation of p90RSK phosphorylation by virus infection.","publish_time":"2006-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a04e4f843ca510866408f472a01bda26e0d80a83.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094696.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579306001219; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579306001219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK","EGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Phosphorylation of Thr573","phosphorylation of Ser380","SARS-CoV infection","phosphorylation status of p90RSK","kinase domains","regulation of p90RSK phosphorylation","confluent SARS-CoV","confluent cells","virus-infected cells","C-terminal kinase domain","virus infection","N-terminal kinase domain","infection of monkey kidney Vero E6 cells","absence of viral infection","extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase","threonine kinases","absence of p38 MAPK activation","pathways","inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","kDa ribosomal S6 kinases","recent study","stimulation of EGF","growth factors","present study","epidermal growth factor","severe acute respiratory syndrome","response","treatment","coronavirus","Ser221","p90RSKs","p90RSK1","dephosphorylation","family","serine","detailed report","weak expression of p90RSK2","well-known substrate","results","autophosphorylation","SB203580","hand","apoptosis","Ser220"],"language":"en"},

In order to support risk assessment practice, the present study aimed to devise a novel statistical model to quantify the country-level risk of experiencing an importation of MERS case. METHODS: We analyzed the arrival time of each reported MERS importation around the world, i.e., the date on which imported cases entered a specific country, which was modeled as a dependent variable in our analysis. We also used openly accessible data including the airline transportation network to parameterize a hazard-based risk prediction model. The hazard was assumed to follow an inverse function of the effective distance (i.e., the minimum effective length of a path from origin to destination), which was calculated from the airline transportation data, from Saudi Arabia to each country. Both country-specific religion and the incidence data of MERS in Saudi Arabia were used to improve our model prediction. RESULTS: Our estimates of the risk of MERS importation appeared to be right skewed, which facilitated the visual identification of countries at highest risk of MERS importations in the right tail of the distribution. The simplest model that relied solely on the effective distance yielded the best predictive performance (Area under the curve (AUC) = 0.943) with 100 % sensitivity and 79.6 % specificity. Out of the 30 countries estimated to be at highest risk of MERS case importation, 17 countries (56.7 %) have already reported at least one importation of MERS. Although model fit measured by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was improved by including country-specific religion (i.e. Muslim majority country), the predictive performance as measured by AUC was not improved after accounting for this covariate. CONCLUSIONS: Our relatively simple statistical model based on the effective distance derived from the airline transportation network data was found to help predicting the risk of importing MERS at the country level. The successful application of the effective distance model to predict MERS importations, particularly when computationally intensive large-scale transmission models may not be immediately applicable could have been benefited from the particularly low transmissibility of the MERS coronavirus.","publish_time":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nah, Kyeongah; Otsuki, Shiori; Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a5ec0f5b18ea19bc152ad79a1b72043385a8f3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4957429.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449387/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1675-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Akaike Information Criterion"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS coronavirus","importation of MERS case","reported MERS importation","highest risk of MERS importations","highest risk of MERS case importation","effective distance model","incidence data of MERS","country-level risk","specific country","model prediction","country level","model fit","country-specific religion","hazard-based risk prediction model","simplest model","airline transportation data","novel statistical model","simple statistical model","risk assessment practice","airline transportation network data","Muslim majority country","accessible data","multiple countries","minimum effective length","Saudi Arabia","visual identification of countries","world","AUC","best predictive performance","right tail","present study","Middle East respiratory syndrome","path","Akaike Information Criterion","Area","arrival time","intensive large-scale transmission models","BACKGROUND","origin","AIC","curve","travelers","successful application","estimates","inverse function","order","CONCLUSIONS","low transmissibility","cases","dependent variable","analysis","destination","METHODS","accounting","distribution","date","RESULTS","sensitivity","specificity","covariate"],"language":"en"},

Development of molecular technologies allowed a better understanding of bronchiolitis aetiology. Results from cohort studies evaluating the association between single, multiple viral infections and clinical outcomes are conflicting. Data on viral bronchiolitis in children were found to be limited in Qatar. This study aimed to determine frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore association between viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study, including children admitted in 2010 and 2011 with acute bronchiolitis. Presenting history, physical examination and respiratory viral co-infections as detected by molecular assays were analysed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 315/369 (85.4%) of included children with single and multiple viruses in 67 and 33% of cases respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most detected virus, accounting for 51.2% followed by rhinovirus (RV) in 25.5% of cases. Fall and summer admissions were associated with longer LOS. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.64,9.59) and age group 1\u20133 months (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.06,9.05) were associated with longer LOS. Crepitation (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12) and respiratory rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66) were associated with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Identifying the viral agent did not influence disease severity or LOS. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation is of more relevance to LOS and disease severity than the detected viruses. Future studies should investigate the interplay between climate characteristics, population\u2019s factors and the most detectable circulating viruses.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public\u2019s attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public\u2019s attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yuxin; Cheng, Sixiang; Yu, Xiaoyan; Xu, Huilan","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199804.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sina Microblog","ROST Content Mining System"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","trend of public attention","widespread public attention","worldwide epidemic","epidemic-related topics","epidemic-related hot topics","hot topic keywords of public attention","sentiment trends of public attention","public health needs","public health emergencies","new cases of COVID","public\u2019s attention","hotspots of public concern","focus of worldwide attention","Sina Microblog hot search list","social network of public opinion content","study","visual cluster analysis of hot keywords","social media","health departments","negative emotions","sentiment analysis","information","China","control","word segmentation","word frequency","measures of prevention","targeted measures","positive emotions","frontline reporting","coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","suspected cases","collected text","changing trend","main findings","ROST Content Mining System version","source of infection","expert interpretation","situation","practice","medical services","categories","impact","VOSviewer","government","events","beginning","emotional tendency","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","discussions","internet","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","stages"],"language":"en"},

Possibilities of repurposing existing drugs based on their in vitro findings have also been elucidated. Probable modes of interference of these compounds at various stages of infection, including entry and replication, have been highlighted. The use of host factors as targets to identify antivirals against CHIKV has been addressed. While most of the earlier antivirals were effective in the early phases of the CHIKV life cycle, this review is also focused on drug candidates that are effective at multiple stages of its life cycle.

The analysis of mechanisms permitting emergence of these viruses has shown that they are not random phenomenons, but they result from accumulated factors leading to transmission from animals to men. Several modes of transmission of infection include: either direct transmission, or by intermediate vectors (mosquitoes, ticks and other (mammals) animals).

The difficulty in designing conserved Pestivirus primers for the amplification of genomes from highly divergent isolates simply by means of overlapping segments is demonstrated using new bioinformatic tools. An alternative procedure consisting of optimizing the length of the genomic cDNA fragments and their subsequent amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a limited set of specific primers is described. The amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs as well as cDNA produced by reverse transcription (RT) has been achieved using this methodology, known as long distance PCR. In the case of viruses, it is necessary to obtain viral particles from infected cells prior to RT procedures. This work provides improvements in four steps of long distance RT-PCR (L-RT-PCR): (i) preparation of a viral stock, (ii) preparation of template RNA, (iii) reverse transcription and (iv) amplification of the cDNA by LD-PCR.

Surveillance systems built on internet data are economically, logistically and epidemiologically appealing and have shown significant promise. The potential for these systems has increased with increased internet availability and shifts in health-related information seeking behaviour. This approach to monitoring infectious diseases has, however, only been applied to single or small groups of select diseases. This study aims to systematically investigate the potential for developing surveillance and early warning systems using internet search data, for a wide range of infectious diseases. METHODS: Official notifications for 64 infectious diseases in Australia were downloaded and correlated with frequencies for 164 internet search terms for the period 2009\u201313 using Spearman\u2019s rank correlations. Time series cross correlations were performed to assess the potential for search terms to be used in construction of early warning systems. RESULTS: Notifications for 17 infectious diseases (26.6%) were found to be significantly correlated with a selected search term. The use of internet metrics as a means of surveillance has not previously been described for 12 (70.6%) of these diseases. The majority of diseases identified were vaccine-preventable, vector-borne or sexually transmissible; cross correlations, however, indicated that vector-borne and vaccine preventable diseases are best suited for development of early warning systems. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that internet-based surveillance systems have broader applicability to monitoring infectious diseases than has previously been recognised. Furthermore, internet-based surveillance systems have a potential role in forecasting emerging infectious disease events, especially for vaccine-preventable and vector-borne diseases.

Cities with poor sanitation are important locations to investigate this aerial exposure pathway as their rapid growth will pose unprecedented challenges in waste management. To address this issue, simple surveillance methods are needed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to optimize a community exposure bioaerosol surveillance strategy for urban outdoor locations with poor sanitation, and to determine which bioaerosols could contribute to exposure. Passive and active bioaerosol sampling methods were used to characterize the fate and transport of sanitation-related bioaerosols during the rainy and dry seasons in La Paz, Bolivia. Median coliform bacteria fluxes were 71 CFU/(m2 \u00D7 h) during the rainy season and 64 CFU/(m2 \u00D7 h) during the dry season, with 38% of the dry season samples testing positive for E. coli. Wind speed, relative humidity and UVB irradiance were identified as significant covariates to consider in bioaerosol transport models in La Paz. Active sampling yielded one positive sample (10%) for human adenovirus (HadV) and one sample (10%) for influenza A virus during the rainy season. HadV was detected at the site with the highest bacterial flux. Four samples (8%) were positive for influenza A virus in the dry season. These findings suggest that aerosols can contribute to community exposure to potentially pathogenic microorganisms in cities with poor sanitation. The use of passive sampling, despite its limitations, can provide quantitative data on microorganisms\u0027 viability within realistic timeframes of personal exposure.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rocha-Melogno, Lucas; Ginn, Olivia; Bailey, Emily S.; Soria, Freddy; Andrade, Marcos; Bergin, Michael H.; Brown, Joe; Gray, Gregory C.; Deshusses, Marc A.","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50dccf7e0c4f4478c07ca745d1d95af61394b0f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139495; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720330126; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330126?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["UVB"],"locations":["La Paz","Bolivia"],"keyphrases":["rainy season","dry season samples","poor sanitation","transport of sanitation","community exposure bioaerosol surveillance strategy","aerial exposure pathway","Abstract Evidence of exposure","active bioaerosol sampling methods","dry seasons","Active sampling","positive sample","realistic timeframes of personal exposure","CFU","bioaerosol transport models","Cities","m2","influenza","Paz","use of passive sampling","HadV","simple surveillance methods","important locations","related bioaerosols","human-waste handling settings","waste management","human adenovirus","urban outdoor locations","UVB irradiance","microorganisms\u0027 viability","enteric pathogens","rapid growth","air","pathogenic microorganisms","quantitative data","significant covariates","associated risk of infection","relative humidity","unprecedented challenges","animal","Wind speed","Median coliform bacteria fluxes","site","literature","limitations","fate","highest bacterial flux","issue","Bolivia","study","objectives","findings"],"language":"en"},

Clinical drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Traditional de novo drug discovery needs more than 10 years, so drug repurposing seems the best option currently to find potential drugs for treating COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with traditional non-covalent drugs, covalent drugs have attracted escalating attention recent years due to their advantages in potential specificity upon careful design, efficiency, and patient burden. We recently developed a computational protocol named as SCAR for discovering covalent drugs. In this work, we used the SCAR protocol to identify possible covalent drugs (approved or clinically tested) targeting the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 11 potential hits, among which at least 6 hits were exclusively enriched by the SCAR protocol. Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Sen; Zheng, Qiang; Wang, Zhiying","journal":"Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc9f1832749dffe4d9f28ad4d077414c5af3cbf0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239142/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential drugs","identified drugs","Clinical drugs","possible covalent drugs","traditional non-covalent drugs","SCAR protocol","potential hits","identified coronavirus SARS-CoV","treatment of COVID","potential specificity","computational protocol","high fatality rate of confirmed COVID","drug repurposing","clinical information","novo drug discovery","escalating attention recent years","advantages","careful design","efficiency","best option","CLpro","patient burden","patients","RESULTS","main protease","massive health crisis","work","infections","MOTIVATION"],"language":"en"},

Airborne respiratory pathogens may settle on the surface of used masks layers, resulting in contamination. The main aim of this study was to study the presence of viruses on the surface of medical masks. METHODS: Two pilot studies in laboratory and clinical settings were carried out to determine the areas of masks likely to contain maximum viral particles. A laboratory study using a mannequin and fluorescent spray showed maximum particles concentrated on upper right, middle and left sections of the medical masks. These findings were confirmed through a small clinical study. The main study was then conducted in high-risk wards of three selected hospitals in Beijing China. Participants (n = 148) were asked to wear medical masks for a shift (6\u20138 h) or as long as they could tolerate. Used samples of medical masks were tested for presence of respiratory viruses in upper sections of the medical masks, in line with the pilot studies. RESULTS: Overall virus positivity rate was 10.1% (15/148). Commonly isolated viruses from masks samples were adenovirus (n = 7), bocavirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2) and influenza virus (n = 2). Virus positivity was significantly higher in masks samples worn for \u003E 6 h (14.1%, 14/99 versus 1.2%, 1/49, OR 7.9, 95% CI 1.01\u201361.99) and in samples used by participants who examined \u003E 25 patients per day (16.9%, 12/71 versus 3.9%, 3/77, OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.35\u201318.60). Most of the participants (83.8%, 124/148) reported at least one problem associated with mask use. Commonly reported problems were pressure on face (16.9%, 25/148), breathing difficulty (12.2%, 18/148), discomfort (9.5% 14/148), trouble communicating with the patient (7.4%, 11/148) and headache (6.1%, 9/148). CONCLUSION: Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (\u003E 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact. Protocols on duration of mask use should specify a maximum time of continuous use, and should consider guidance in high contact settings. Viruses were isolated from the upper sections of around 10% samples, but other sections of masks may also be contaminated. HCWs should be aware of these risks in order to protect themselves and people around them.","publish_time":"2019-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Rawlinson, William; Pontivivo, Giulietta; Wang, Quanyi; Pan, Yang; Zhang, Daitao; Zhang, Yi; Li, Lili; MacIntyre, C.

They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or \u201Cgenetic robustness,\u201D and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different \u201Clife-styles\u201D they possess.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barr, J.

Modern investigations showed that it has a wide range of pharmacological actions with little toxicological side effect and the pure compounds have been used for curing hepatic and biliary disorders for decades. However, extensive consumption of bear bile made bears endangered species. In the 1980\u0027s, bear farming was established in China to extract bear bile from living bears with \u0022Free-dripping Fistula Technique\u0022. Bear farming is extremely inhumane and many bears died of illness such as chronic infections and liver cancer. Efforts are now given by non-governmental organizations, mass media and Chinese government to end bear farming ultimately. At the same time, systematic research has to be done to find an alternative for bear bile. In this review, we focused on the literature, laboratory and clinical results related to bear bile and its substitutes or alternative in English and Chinese databases. We examined the substitutes or alternative of bear bile from three aspects: pure compounds derived from bear bile, biles from other animals and herbs from TCM. We then discussed the strategy for stopping the trading of bear bile and issues of bear bile related to potential alternative candidates, existing problems in alternative research and work to be done in the future.","publish_time":"2009-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Yibin; Siu, Kayu; Wang, Ning; Ng, Kwan-Ming; Tsao, Sai-Wah; Nagamatsu, Tadashi; Tong, Yao","journal":"J Ethnobiol Ethnomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f997749a5fc2672a931ecc329c5f3e1c4c6cae9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2630947.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-4269-5-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19138420/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["alternative of bear bile","Bear farming","issues of bear bile","trading of bear bile","extensive consumption of bear bile","alternative research","potential alternative candidates","Chinese government","pure compounds","Chinese databases","substitutes","TCM","Traditional Chinese Medicine","bears endangered species","systematic research","existing problems","mass media","effect","non-governmental organizations","wide range of pharmacological actions","curing hepatic","aspects","illness","work","clinical results","animals","biles","chronic infections","literature","biliary disorders","decades","laboratory","English","liver cancer","herbs","thousands of years","China","Fistula Technique","Efforts","time","strategy","Modern investigations","review","future"],"language":"en"},

HMPV has a worldwide distribution with infectivity rates approaching 100%, and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk from viral exposure. No anti-HMPV vaccine is available and diagnosis is primarily based on in-house molecular or serological tests, in part due to limited availability of recombinant HMPV antigens. Objective To generate a panel of HMPV-derived recombinant antigens, develop standardised ELISA systems for HMPV IgG detection and explore the nature of B cell memory against HMPV to underpin future vaccine studies. Study design HMPV viral RNA was isolated from a clinical specimen and RT-PCR was conducted. The HMPV M and P genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The HMPV N gene was cloned and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Each purified recombinant antigens was subsequently employed in HMPV-specific ELISA. Results High-level expression, and purification, of both HMPV matrix (M) (10mg/g cells) and phosphoprotein (P) (3.82mg/g cells) were achieved in an E. coli expression system. Recombinant HMPV (N) was successfully expressed in, and purified from the baculovirus expression system. Overall, a 99% HMPV IgG seroprevalence was observed (n =96) using HMPV M-, N- and P-ELISA, respectively. The M antigen proved to be the most diagnostically useful with 99% of specimens tested exhibiting anti-M protein reactivity. A high correlation was observed between anti-M and N IgG reactivity (r =0.96), with significant correlation also evident for anti-N and P IgG reactivity (r =0.74). Lowest correlation was evident for anti-M and P IgG reactivity (r =0.57). Finally, the first demonstration of HMPV-specific B cell memory (ranging 1\u201315 spot forming cells (SFC)/million cells) was achieved against M and P antigens in 40% of individuals tested. Conclusion This work describes robust diagnostic systems for HMPV and new insight into antigen-specific B cell memory against HMPV.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Shaughnessy, Luke; Carr, Michael; Crowley, Brendan; Carberry, Stephen; Doyle, Sean","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f34c3caf71458b544936bc3f9720f107a3afcfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108261.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653211003192; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.07.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653211003192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","HMPV IgG","HMPV M and P","HMPV N","Recombinant HMPV","P IgG"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["panel of HMPV","demonstration of HMPV","HMPV matrix","anti-HMPV vaccine","HMPV N gene","HMPV IgG detection","HMPV IgG seroprevalence","HMPV-specific ELISA","limited availability of recombinant HMPV antigens","anti-N","N IgG reactivity","P IgG reactivity","P antigens","Study design HMPV viral RNA","P-ELISA","P genes","g cells","purified recombinant antigens","derived recombinant antigens","insect cells","baculovirus expression system","coli expression system","antigen-specific B cell memory","nature of B cell memory","protein reactivity","High-level expression","standardised ELISA systems","significant correlation","Lowest correlation","high correlation","viral exposure","Escherichia coli","robust diagnostic systems","future vaccine studies","new insight","diagnosis","clinical specimen","risk","infectivity rates","worldwide distribution","Abstract Background Human metapneumovirus","specimens","purification","serological tests","RT-PCR","immunocompromised patients","Conclusion","spot","SFC","phosphoprotein","development of asthma","respiratory infection","accounting","humans","Objective","individuals","disease"],"language":"en"},

The network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to influenza-like illnesses (ILI), corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses. There were 180,192 declared visits to the 11 sentinel sites between week 11-2012 and week 52-2013; 24% of the visits were for fever syndromes and 25% of the cases of fever syndrome were ILI. Rhinoviruses were the most frequent cause of ILI (19%), before adenoviruses (18%), enteroviruses (18%) and influenza A viruses (13%). Co-circulation and co-infection were frequent and were responsible for ILI peaks. In conclusion, it is clear that the greatest advantage of this system is the ease with which it can be implemented, thanks to the availability of mobile phones and mobile phone networks.

In this study, we demonstrated that BoHV-1 infection at the late stage (at 24 h after infection) dramatically decreased histone H3 acetylation [at residues K9 (H3K9ac) and K18 (H3K18ac)], which was supported by the pronounced depletion of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) including CBP/P300 (CREB binding protein and p300), GCN5L2 (general control of amino acid synthesis yeast homolog like 2) and PCAF (P300/CBP-associated factor). The depletion of GCN5L2 promoted by virus infection was partially mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, the viral replication was enhanced by HAT (histone acetyltransferase) activator CTPB [N-(4-Chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecylbenzamide], and vice versa, inhibited by HAT inhibitor Anacardic acid (AA), suggesting that BoHV-1 may take advantage of histone acetylation for efficient replication.

Hence characterization i.e. identification and quantification of different airborne microorganisms in various indoor environments is necessary to identify the associated risks and to establish exposure threshold. Along with the bioaerosol sampling and their analytical techniques, various literatures revealing the concentration levels of bioaerosol have been mentioned in this review thereby contributing to the knowledge of identification and quantification of bioaerosols and their different constituents in various indoor environments (both occupational and non-occupational sections). Apart from recognition of bioaerosol, developments of their control mechanisms also play an important role. Hence several control methods have also been briefly reviewed. However, several individual levels of efforts such as periodic cleaning operations, maintenance activities and proper ventilation system also serve in their best way to improve indoor air quality.","publish_time":"2015-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Bipasha; Lal, Himanshu; Srivastava, Arun","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f955e3cdd0a2c0b84e634062e1bf939d9812641.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132379.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412015300581; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2015.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26436919/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412015300581","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various indoor environments","bioaerosol sampling","recognition of bioaerosol","concentration levels of bioaerosol","various literatures","importance of bioaerosol research","indoor air quality","quantification of different airborne microorganisms","different constituents","tiny organisms of various size ranges present","quantification of bioaerosols","airborne particles","knowledge of identification","control mechanisms","control methods","non-occupational sections","individual levels of efforts","maintenance activities","periodic cleaning operations","bacteria","proper ventilation system","secondary metabolites","best way","analytical techniques","influenza","dead fungi","associated risks","health issues of human beings","pandemic outbreak of flue","viruses","developments","life stocks","exposure threshold","H1N1 virus","pollens","important role","characterization","Bio-terror attacks","review"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the disease burden and the molecular epidemiology of HAdV. Objectives To retrospectively perform a molecular characterization of HAdV positive samples received at Statens Serum Institut during the period 2011\u20132016 and to compare this with demographic information, geographic location, sample collection date and type and co-infection with other viral pathogens. Study design 152 HAdV positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of a fragment of the hexon gene using published primers along with a newly developed primer set for enhanced genotyping of HAdV D. Phylogenetic analysis was used for genotyping and genotypes were compared with epidemiological information. In addition, HAdV burden and co-infection was evaluated for samples tested in laboratory analysis packages. Results Six out of seven HAdV species were identified and represented by 13 types. Young children (\u003C5 years old) were more likely to be positive for HAdV and co-infections with other gastrointestinal or respiratory viruses were common. Possible outbreaks of ocular infections due to HAdV D could not be confirmed. Conclusion A diverse set of HAdV species were circulating in Denmark in the study period and although possible transmission clusters were identified, this could not be verified with current genotyping methods Young children were commonly affected by HAdV infection and co-infections with other viral pathogens were frequent suggesting a possible underestimation of the real HAdV burden.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnadas, C\u00E9line; Schmidt, Dennis Jelsbak; Fischer, Thea K.; Fonager, Jannik","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72342028f7266c8f64b3a9fbcc718132b2ff23d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106356.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704734/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301045; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.04.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["Statens Serum Institut","HAdV D.

Because the NP is the viral protein shed during infection and its template mRNA is the most abundant subgenomic RNA, it is a suitable candidate for developing antibodies for diagnostic applications. In this study, we have prepared full-length SARS-CoV NP expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Full-length NP was used for the preparation of mouse monoclonal antibody and chicken polyclonal IgY antibodies for the development of heterosandwich ELISA for early diagnostics of SARS-suspected individuals. The sensitivity of the developed heterosandwich ELISA can detect the viral antigen at 18.5 pg/mL of recombinant NP. This study describes ultrasensitive ELISA using 19B6 monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody and IgY as the detecting antibody against the most abundant SARS-CoV NP antigens. One of the most important findings was the use of inexpensive polyclonal IgY antibody to increase the sensitivity of the detection system for SARS-CoV at the picogram level.

Although well characterized in viruses, how these elements may regulate cellular gene expression is not understood. Here we describe a \u22121 PRF signal in the human mRNA encoding CCR5, the HIV-1 co-receptor. CCR5 mRNA-mediated \u22121 PRF is directed by an mRNA pseudoknot, and is stimulated by at least two microRNAs. Mapping the mRNA\u2013miRNA interaction suggests that formation of a triplex RNA structure stimulates \u22121 PRF. A \u22121 PRF event on the CCR5 mRNA directs translating ribosomes to a premature termination codon, destabilizing it through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. At least one additional mRNA decay pathway is also involved. Functional \u22121 PRF signals that seem to be regulated by miRNAs are also demonstrated in mRNAs encoding six other cytokine receptors, suggesting a novel mode through which immune responses may be fine-tuned in mammalian cells.

Basal core promoter mutations (BCP), associated with the clinical course of chronic HBV infection, affect HBV-X at 130\u2013131 positions. The role of these mutations on HBV-X biological activity remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the presence of different amino acids at 130\u2013131 positions of HBV-X on the biological activity of the protein. Transient expression of wild type and mutant F1b and F4 HBV-X increased cell mortality by the induction of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. The wild type and mutant HBV-X differentially modulate the expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X) regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, the expression of HBV-X variants of both subgenotypes induced autophagy of human tumoral hepatocytes. In conclusion, HBV-X variants of the Latin American HBV F genotype promotes human hepatocytes death by the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The results of this work describe some of the molecular mechanisms by which HBV-X variants contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases in the infected liver and help to the biological characterization of genotype F, responsible of the majority of HBV infections in Argentina.","publish_time":"2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elizalde, Mar\u00EDa Mercedes; Campos, Rodolfo H\u00E9ctor; Barbini, Luciana","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8e925c81013813f986199679a738341c9a02b82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986109/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.09.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217305464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217305464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Latin American HBV","HBV"],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["HBV-X variants","mutant HBV-X","F4 HBV-X","expression of HBV","positions of HBV","HBV-X biological activity","Bcl-X","majority of HBV infections","Latin American HBV F genotype","clinical course of chronic HBV infection","hepatitis B virus X protein","human hepatocytes death","biological characterization of genotype F","induction of apoptosis","pathogenesis of liver diseases","infected liver","Transient expression of wild type","expression of pro-apoptotic","multifunctional regulatory protein","subgenotypes induced autophagy of human tumoral hepatocytes","human hepatoma cells","mutant F1b","regulatory proteins","Basal core promoter mutations","Bax","cell mortality","BCP","presence of different amino acids","molecular mechanisms","impact","work","Argentina","conclusion","study","family","role","aim","results"],"language":"en"},

We reviewed the NZ RF surveillance sector, aiming to identify potential improvements which would support optimal RF control and prevention activities. METHODS: This review used a recently developed surveillance sector review method. Interviews with 36 key informants were used to describe the sector, assess it and identify its gaps. Priorities for improvement and implementation strategies were determined following discussion with these key informants, with policy advisors and within the research team. RESULTS: Key improvements identified included the need for a comprehensive RF surveillance strategy, integrated reporting and an online national RF register. At a managerial level this review provided evidence for system change and built support for this across the surveillance sector. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance sector review approach can be added to the small set of tools currently available for developing and evaluating surveillance systems. This new approach is likely to prove useful as we confront the challenges of combating new emerging infectious diseases, responding to global environmental changes, and reducing health inequalities.","publish_time":"2014-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliver, Jane; Pierse, Nevil; Baker, Michael G","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60d68e4052a397966e72c6eda0895ca7d27afb68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4049392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885018/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-528","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NZ RF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NZ RF surveillance sector","surveillance sector review approach","surveillance systems","developed surveillance sector review method","comprehensive RF surveillance strategy","new approach","key informants","Key improvements","optimal RF control","online national RF register","New Zealand","new emerging infectious diseases","potential improvements","built support","integrated reporting","evidence","need","global environmental changes","following discussion","implementation strategies","challenges","policy advisors","Government","incidence of rheumatic fever","strong commitment","prevention activities","CONCLUSIONS","health inequalities","managerial level","small set of tools","Priorities","research team","thirds","BACKGROUND","cases","Interviews","RESULTS","METHODS","gaps"],"language":"en"},

Guinea pigs have wide bodies with short limbs. They have a short, flat nose, laterally placed eyes, and hairless external pinnae. The dentition of the guinea pig is described as aradicular hypsodont. Guinea pigs are best housed in well-ventilated, wire-sided cages with solid bottoms. If housed indoors, guinea pig enclosures do not require a cover, as these animals do not typically jump or climb. Heavy food containers are recommended to make dumping of the receptacle more difficult. All food containers should be easy to disinfect and should be cleaned regularly, because guinea pigs have a habit of soiling their food bowls. These animals, native to the Andes Mountains, are very susceptible to hyperthermia and should never be housed in temperatures greater than 80\u00B0F. High humidity can also exacerbate a guinea pig\u0027s sensitivity to elevated temperatures by increasing the heat index. Guinea pigs often do not exhibit clinical signs early in a disease process. Therefore, a thorough physical examination can be extremely useful in determining the overall health status of the animal.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riggs, Shannon M.","journal":"Manual of Exotic Pet Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50d63047b9c6e7a123c1210f25a33fd02018c5dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151879.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500202; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guinea","Andes Mountains"],"keyphrases":["guinea pig enclosures","guinea pig\u0027s sensitivity","medical care issues of guinea pigs","Heavy food containers","food bowls","animals","short limbs","temperatures greater","overall health status","placed eyes","wire-sided cages","wide bodies","Andes Mountains","clinical signs","solid bottoms","hairless external pinnae","chapter","flat nose","dumping","High humidity","habit","thorough physical examination","disease process","cover","aradicular hypsodont","Publisher Summary","receptacle","hyperthermia","heat index","dentition"],"language":"en"},

Acute bronchitis usually of viral etiology and in immunocompetent patients without comorbidity treatment is symptomatic with analgesics and anti-inflammatories. The main cause of exacerbation of COPD is the respiratory infection. The indication of empirical antibiotic choice and it is based on clinical criteria, the severity of the underlying disease, the severity of the exacerbation and the presence of risk factors for infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death by infection. The use of prognostic severity scales (PSI or CURB-65) is recommended for deciding where treatment is started, the tests to be performed for the etiological diagnosis and the recommended empirical antibiotic therapy. Patients with Healthcare Associated Pneumonia (HCAP) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP) have a higher risk of infection by multiresistant microorganisms (MMR) and increased morbidity and mortality. It requires specific empirical treatment depending on the severity of disease and risk factors for infection MMR.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Remart\u00EDnez, S.

This preliminary dataset identifies INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting further translational study.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Trevor R F; Patel, Ami; Ramos, Stephanie; Elwood, Dustin; Zhu, Xizhou; Yan, Jian; Gary, Ebony N; Walker, Susanne N; Schultheis, Katherine; Purwar, Mansi; Xu, Ziyang; Walters, Jewell; Bhojnagarwala, Pratik; Yang, Maria; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Pezzoli, Patrick; Parzych, Elizabeth; Reuschel, Emma L; Doan, Arthur; Tursi, Nicholas; Vasquez, Miguel; Choi, Jihae; Tello-Ruiz, Edgar; Maricic, Igor; Bah, Mamadou A; Wu, Yuanhan; Amante, Dinah; Park, Daniel H; Dia, Yaya; Ali, Ali Raza; Zaidi, Faraz I; Generotti, Alison; Kim, Kevin Y; Herring, Timothy A; Reeder, Sophia; Andrade, Viviane M; Buttigieg, Karen; Zhao, Gan; Wu, Jiun-Ming; Li, Dan; Bao, Linlin; Liu, Jiangning; Deng, Wei; Qin, Chuan; Brown, Ami Shah; Khoshnejad, Makan; Wang, Nianshuang; Chu, Jacqueline; Wrapp, Daniel; McLellan, Jason S; Muthumani, Kar; Wang, Bin; Carroll, Miles W; Kim, J Joseph; Boyer, Jean; Kulp, Daniel W; Humeau, Laurent M P F; Weiner, David B; Broderick, Kate E","journal":"Nature communications","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16505-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","S protein","INO","synthetic DNA vaccine","biodistribution of SARS","synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate","block Spike protein binding","MERS coronavirus Spike","functional antibodies","potential COVID","translational study","clinical study","engineered construct","coronavirus family member","pandemic viral pneumonia disease","major surface antigen of coronaviruses","antigen-specific T cell responses","ACE2 receptor","infection","results","causal agent","robust expression","guinea pigs","immunization of mice","prior experience","dissemination","preliminary dataset","time","lungs"],"language":"en"},

These different responses in males and females may be related to the actions of sex hormones. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which causes COVID-19.

Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Results The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.

The H4N6 and H6N1 viruses were less affected by BST-2 expression than PR8, due to their ability to decrease BST-2 levels, a function localized to the PA segment of both avian viruses. Experiments with PA-mutant and -chimeric viruses confirmed that the avian PA segment conferred BST-2 downregulation and antagonism.

Herein, 30-nm aluminum nanoparticles (ANs), unlike the mostly used adjuvant alum which is unsuitable for delivering pulmonary vaccines due to side effects, proved able to act as a VADS fitting inhalation immunization to elicit wide-spread anti-antigen immunity. In vitro ANs facilitated cellular uptake of their cargos and, after pulmonary vaccination, induced mouse production of high levels of anti-antigen IgG in serum and IgA in saliva, nasal, bronchoalveolar and also vaginal fluids. Besides, IFN-\u03B3 and anti-antigen IgG2a enriched in immunized mice which meanwhile showed no obvious lung inflammation indicated balanced Th1/Th2 responses were safely induced. These outcomes suggest ANs may be an efficient pulmonary VADS for defending against pathogens, especially, the ones invading hosts via respiratory system.

The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, we suggest guidelines as to how to triage patients in need of SHD interventions and provide a framework of how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic.

The potent compounds showed 50% maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) values ranging from 8 to 1468 nM as determined by immunofluorescent assay of the expression of TGEV N and S proteins and by real time-quantitative PCR analysis of viral yields. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine compounds exerted profound anti-TGEV replication activity and thereby blocked the TGEV-induced apoptosis and subsequent cytopathic effect in ST cells. Analysis of the structure\u2013activity relations indicated that the most active tylophorine analogues were compounds with a hydroxyl group at the C14 position of the indolizidine moiety or at the C3 position of the phenanthrene moiety and that the quinolizidine counterparts were more potent than indolizidines. In addition, tylophorine compounds strongly reduced cytopathic effect in Vero 76 cells induced by human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), with EC(50) values ranging from less than 5 to 340 nM. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated high and comparable oral bioavailabilities of 7-methoxycryptopleurine (52.7%) and the naturally occurring tylophorine (65.7%) in rats.

Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. RESULTS: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004\u20132007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. CONCLUSION: The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus.","publish_time":"2008-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, TF; Corr\u00EAa, RL; Castilho, Y; Silvie, P; B\u00E9lot, J-L; Vaslin, MFS","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/727602c6861782ad9eb87bfff3fc6824b7008af5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2583970.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18937850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBD"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["Atypical CBD symptoms","major cotton","CLRDV diversity","CBD-symptomatic plants","susceptible cotton varieties","Cotton blue disease","genetic diversity of CLRDV","important cotton-growing states","Brazilian cotton fields","divergent isolates","Cotton leafroll dwarf virus","CLRDV-related coat protein","important global cotton crop pathology responsible","low genetic diversity","states of Brazil","viral coat protein","widespread distribution","genus Polerovirus","major economic losses","distinct RdRp sequence","intense green foliage","internodal","leaf rolling","RNA polymerase","new species","yellowing veins","intergenic region genomic sequences","withered leaves","BACKGROUND","taxonomic rules","family Luteoviridae","CONCLUSION","recombination events","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To date, its effectiveness in cancer clinical trials has been minimal. Some suggestions are provided for that disappointment and recent citations are provided that support the idea that G3139 may be effective at clearing viral infections, specifically HIV. At the time G3139 was conceived as an anti-cancer drug candidate, it was viewed optimistically because Bcl-2 was widely believed to be the most important protein blocking p53-dependent apoptosis caused by internal stress. Since that time, we have learnt that Bcl-2 is not the only protein that inhibits apoptosis and that p53 itself is frequently malfunctioning in tumors. Thus, the anti-cancer utility of suppressing Bcl-2 in cancer cells is limited. Moreover, Bcl-2 has a role in halting the cell cycle (though p27), which may slow down tumor growth; and Bcl-2 even has pro-apoptotic roles in the execution of apoptosis initiated by external death signals (via Fas/CD95 and caspase 3). Overall, in the clinical setting, G3139 usually has statistically significant but medically unimportant benefit. These results have greatly diminished the enthusiasm for the drug especially when the side effects are considered. Specifically, the unmethylated CpG ODN (and/or the phosphorothioate group) activates the immune system, but this potentially important anti-cancer effect is lost when the immune cells undergo premature apoptosis apparently because their Bcl-2 levels have been lowered by the antisense effect of G3139. While this effect on immune cells is usually undesirable, it is exactly what would be useful for activating immune cells, initiating provirus transcription in retrovirus-infected cells, and facilitating selective apoptosis of these infected cells. In general, G3139 might have benefit in clearing chronic infections by intracellular parasites including viruses (HIV, SIV, HTLV, HBV, coronavirus, etc.). Indeed, G3139 has been shown to cause apoptosis in EBV-infected cells leading to clearance of the virus.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parris, George E.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf50d4bbeba13505750b22d0c0c1f46c6834ed77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126701.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987707001107; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987707001107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genta, Inc."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bcl","cancer cells","immune cells","time G3139","antisense drug G3139","antisense effect of G3139","retrovirus-infected cells","EBV-infected cells","execution of apoptosis","selective apoptosis","premature apoptosis","important anti-cancer effect","anti-cancer drug candidate","anti-cancer utility","cancer clinical trials","immune system","important protein blocking p53-dependent apoptosis","HIV","unmethylated CpG ODN","unmethylated CpG units","chronic infections","phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide","viral infections","phosphorothioate group","clinical setting","unimportant benefit","viruses","initiating provirus transcription","SIV","intracellular parasites","oblimersen sodium","external death signals","Fas","HTLV","Genta","pro-apoptotic roles","CD95","HBV","effectiveness","clearance","Summary","internal stress","disappointment","cell cycle","coronavirus","idea","recent citations","p27","caspase","enthusiasm","tumor growth","levels","results","suggestions","tumors","effects"],"language":"en"},

Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.","publish_time":"2008-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mossong, Jo\u00EBl; Hens, Niel; Jit, Mark; Beutels, Philippe; Auranen, Kari; Mikolajczyk, Rafael; Massari, Marco; Salmaso, Stefania; Tomba, Gianpaolo Scalia; Wallinga, Jacco; Heijne, Janneke; Sadkowska-Todys, Malgorzata; Rosinska, Magdalena; Edmunds, W.

Several studies have found variability in the expression of commonly used housekeeping genes, such as beta-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), under different experimental settings. However, ACTB and GAPDH remain widely used in the studies of host gene response to virus infections, including influenza viruses. To date no detailed study has been described that compares the suitability of commonly used housekeeping genes in influenza virus infections. The present study evaluated several commonly used housekeeping genes [ACTB, GAPDH, 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ATP synthase, H\u002B transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide (ATP5B) and ATP synthase, H\u002B transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9) (ATP5G1)] to identify the most stably expressed gene in human, pig, chicken and duck cells infected with a range of influenza A virus subtypes. RESULTS: The relative expression stability of commonly used housekeeping genes were determined in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), pig tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs), and chicken and duck primary lung-derived cells infected with five influenza A virus subtypes. Analysis of qRT-PCR data from virus and mock infected cells using NormFinder and BestKeeper software programmes found that 18S rRNA was the most stable gene in HBECs, PTECs and avian lung cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the presented data from cell culture models (HBECs, PTECs, chicken and duck lung cells) infected with a range of influenza viruses, we found that 18S rRNA is the most stable reference gene for normalising qRT-PCR data. Expression levels of the other housekeeping genes evaluated in this study (including ACTB and GPADH) were highly affected by influenza virus infection and hence are not reliable as reference genes for RNA normalisation.","publish_time":"2012-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Tellabati, Meenu; Nelli, Rahul K; White, Gavin A; Perez, Belinda Baquero; Sebastian, Sujith; Slomka, Marek J; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Dunham, Stephen P; Chang, Kin-Chow","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d014a65d8069ebac6e33bc8bc4dba674151e07d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499178.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23043930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["housekeeping genes","duck cells","influenza virus infections","reference genes","virus subtypes","duck lung cells","mock infected cells","ACTB","avian lung cells","S rRNA","stable gene","tracheal epithelial cells","stable reference gene","range of influenza viruses","duck primary lung-derived cells","HBECs","PTECs","chicken","normalising qRT-PCR data","internal reference gene","GAPDH","primary human bronchial epithelial cells","presented data","S ribosomal RNA","studies of host gene response","transporting","ATP synthase","Analysis of qRT","Expression levels","present study","pig","detailed study","mitochondrial F1 complex","mitochondrial Fo complex","relative expression stability","requisite of quantitative reverse transcription PCR","beta polypeptide","subunit C1","beta-actin","RNA normalisation","ATP5B","NormFinder","BestKeeper software programmes","cell culture models","glyceraldehyde","treatment","phosphate dehydrogenase","different experimental settings","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","GPADH","ATP5G1","CONCLUSIONS","variability","suitability"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane \u03B1-helical domain, with its N- and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15. In addition, these results strongly support a general model where transmembrane domains transiently adopt many aggregation states necessary for function.","publish_time":"2005-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, Jaume; Wang, Jifeng; Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Biophysical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58c2c2285c380d900475381d9e456b58dc4474ea.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fc9d1baea37339edaa81609ec01500616b8a48b9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/26806c0f7e40767e8fb93dbbd2f1dc2566fb6a09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1305130.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349505731945; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349505731945; http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349505731945/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein E oligomerization","synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E","coronavirus protein E homologous sequences","transmembrane domains","putative transmembrane domain","transmembrane \u03B1-helical domain","pentameric models","type of transmembrane oligomer","SARS virus","results of molecular dynamics simulations","support","pentameric aggregates","homooligomeric \u03B1-helical bundles","different coronaviruses","persistent structure","main assumptions","identical backbone structure","low energy dimeric","evolutionary conservation","severe acute respiratory syndrome","residues essential","life cycle","opposite faces","point","SCoVE","aggregation states necessary","C-termini","hypothesis","general model","SDS","aggregational space","lipid bilayer","function","homologs","N15","addition","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we predicted the spread of COVID-19 and its burden on hospital care under different conditions of social distancing in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, the two regions of Italy most affected by the epidemic. To do this, we used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) deterministic model, which encompasses compartments relevant to public health interventions such as quarantine. A new compartment L was added to the model for isolated infected population, i.e., individuals tested positives that do not need hospital care. We found that in Lombardy restrictive containment measures should be prolonged at least until early July to avoid a resurgence of hospitalizations; on the other hand, in Emilia-Romagna the number of hospitalized cases could be kept under a reasonable amount with a higher contact rate. Our results suggest that territory-specific forecasts under different scenarios are crucial to enhance or take new containment measures during the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reno, Chiara; Lenzi, Jacopo; Navarra, Antonio; Barelli, Eleonora; Gori, Davide; Lanza, Alessandro; Valentini, Riccardo; Tang, Biao; Fantini, Maria Pia","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429121/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051492","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","Emilia-Romagna","hospital care","new containment measures","spread of COVID","epidemic","Lombardy restrictive containment measures","number of hospitalized cases","world\u0027s centers of active coronavirus cases","different scenarios","deterministic model","regions of Italy","Northern Italy","new compartment","outbreak of coronavirus disease","different conditions of social distancing","compartments relevant","territory-specific forecasts","public health interventions","burden","isolated infected population","individuals","positives","higher contact rate","quarantine","results","hand","SEIR","resurgence of hospitalizations","Wuhan","China","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, real-time, non-invasive shadowgraph imaging was applied to obtain additional analyses of cough airflows produced by healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, mean age 32.2\u00B112.9 years; 10 men, mean age 25.3\u00B12.5 years) were asked to cough freely, then into their sleeves (as per current US CDC recommendations) in this study to analyze cough airflow dynamics. For the 10 females (cases 1\u201310), their maximum detectable cough propagation distances ranged from 0.16\u20130.55 m, with maximum derived velocities of 2.2\u20135.0 m/s, and their maximum detectable 2-D projected areas ranged from 0.010\u20130.11 m(2), with maximum derived expansion rates of 0.15\u20130.55 m(2)/s. For the 10 males (cases 11\u201320), their maximum detectable cough propagation distances ranged from 0.31\u20130.64 m, with maximum derived velocities of 3.2\u201314 m/s, and their maximum detectable 2-D projected areas ranged from 0.04\u20130.14 m(2), with maximum derived expansion rates of 0.25\u20131.4 m(2)/s. These peak velocities were measured when the visibility of the exhaled airflows was optimal and compare favorably with those reported previously using other methods, and may be seen as a validation of these previous approaches in a more natural setting. However, the propagation distances can only represent a lower limit due to the inability of the shadowgraph method to visualize these cough airflows once their temperature cools to that of the ambient air, which is an important limitation of this methodology. The qualitative high-speed video footage of these volunteers coughing into their sleeves demonstrates that although this method rarely completely blocks the cough airflow, it decelerates, splits and redirects the airflow, eventually reducing its propagation. The effectiveness of this intervention depends on optimum positioning of the arm over the nose and mouth during coughing, though unsightly stains on sleeves may make it unacceptable to some.","publish_time":"2012-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Julian W.; Nicolle, Andre; Pantelic, Jovan; Koh, Gerald C.; Wang, Liang De; Amin, Muhammad; Klettner, Christian A.; Cheong, David K.

We aim to develop a consensus recommendation for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in such patients. After an extensive literature review, draft recommendations were amended jointly by 27 partners from 15 European countries. Recommendations include repetitive training of staff to ascertain infection control, systematic use of cough and respiratory etiquette at admission to the emergency department, fluid sampling in the isolation room, and analyses in biosafety level 3/4 laboratories, and preference for point-of-care bedside laboratory tests. Children should be cared for by paediatricians and intensive-care patients should be cared for by critical-care doctors in high-level isolation units (HLIU).

Pretreatment (exclusion assay), coincubation (competition assay), and post-treatment (displacement assay) of PEDV-infected Vero cells with the S-layer protein was examined. Interestingly, significant inhibition of PEDV by S-layer protein was only observed in the exclusion assay. In Vero cells infected with PEDV, we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the late stage of infection. When PEDV-infected Vero cells were pretreated with S-layer protein, rates of Vero cell apoptosis were markedly decreased and cell damage was significantly reduced, as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy. Detailed analyses showed that the S-layer protein inhibited caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein plays an inhibitory role during PEDV infection of Vero cells, and that the antagonistic activity of the protein is not via competition with PEDV for binding sites. In addition, the findings suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein protects against PEDV-induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in the later stages of infection. This mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing PEDV and other viruses.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaoyan; Li, Pengcheng; Zheng, Qisheng; Hou, Jibo","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0399922a636e04aa6b5ffe2989e4d147ccd5626.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642593/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518312963; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518312963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acidophilus S-layer protein","S-layer protein inhibited caspase","PEDV infection of Vero cells","PEDV-infected Vero cells","S-layer protein antiviral activity","antagonizing PEDV","PEDV-induced apoptosis of Vero cells","significant inhibition of PEDV","activation of caspase","reduced caspase","S-layer protein impacts porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","rates of Vero cell apoptosis","competition assay","exclusion assay","displacement assay","mechanism of Lactobacillus acidophilus","later stages of infection","late stage of infection","antagonistic activity","cell damage","inhibitory role","post-treatment","coincubation","novel approach","insight","Pretreatment","viruses","binding sites","findings","Detailed analyses","flow cytometry","microscopy","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

Careful selection of appropriate textiles is crucial for the performance, use, care, and maintenance of protective clothing. Broadly, a clear understanding of the work environment and performance requirements, as well as knowledge of the textiles is essential for the decision making process. According to the OSHA Technical Manual, the greater the level of chemical protective clothing, the greater are the associated risks. For any given situation, equipment and clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. Overprotection as well as under-protection can be hazardous and should be avoided. In addition to protection, the selection of textiles takes into consideration factors such as the impact of protective clothing on job performance; comfort; durability; availability, and cost; use, care, and maintenance, and cultural factors. To select protective clothing materials, relevant factors have to be identified and prioritized in a multi-step process. This chapter presents a model of the decision-making process and provides some examples of the level of detail necessary in each step.

In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.","publish_time":"2012-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Wang, Jia-Xin; Wu, Dong-Dong; Wang, Hua-Wei; Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Zhang, Ya-Ping","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28b64c3ea5c13cbcaae132a45661fb8bf5c25c62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3261175.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22279577/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HGDP","VNTR","SNP"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["repeat number of VNTR locus","VNTR locus present","VNTR alleles of different repeat length","different populations","CLEC4M","human populations","basic repeat subunits","polymorphic variable number tandem repeat","different tribes","worldwide populations","limited number of haplotypes","origin","chromosomes","Human Genome Diversity Panel","present diversity profile","neutral evolution","cell adhesion receptor","HGDP-CEPH panel","pathogen recognition receptor","C-type lectin gene","mutation events","effect of migration","dispersion of modern humans","base pairs","Europeans","pathogens of important public health concern","differential allele advantage","genetic predisposition","samples","subunit configuration","previous report","Middle Easterns","neck-region","SNP data","Oceania","Asians","infectious diseases","Americans","composition","Africans","analyses","fact","hypothesis","results","total","orientation","repeats","insight","sequence identities","findings"],"language":"en"},

Recent emerging viral threats including Zika, Ebola, and the current COVID-19 outbreak highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal pre-amplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable to detect other viruses. We demonstrate the adaptability of our method by quickly developing and testing DNA nanoswitches for detecting a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human saliva. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Lifeng; Chandrasekaran, Arun Richard; Punnoose, Jibin Abraham; Bonenfant, Gaston; Charles, Stephon; Levchenko, Oksana; Badu, Pheonah; Cavaliere, Cassandra; Pager, Cara T.; Halvorsen, Ken","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d85d0f31de25ad04839a6c93fb93bfb69414d2a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f8e8a9c6f5662c1739be031e6134284ef08ea8b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.12.902452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral detection","rapid detection of viral RNA","viral strains","non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA","emergent viral threats","RNA extraction","multiplexed detection","Recent emerging viral threats","related viruses","assay","specific viruses","testing DNA nanoswitches","attomole level","Zika virus","clinical-level sensitivity","Ebola","model system","sample preparation step","biological fluids","fragment of SARS","isothermal pre-amplification","outbreak","current COVID","platform","disease","development","lab infrastructure","cost","field implementation","method","human saliva","response","difficulty","progression","impact","versatility","adaptability","challenges"],"language":"en"},

We first describe a novel method, SiteEngine, that assumes no sequence or fold similarities and is able to recognize proteins that have similar binding sites and may perform similar functions. We achieve high efficiency and speed by introducing a low-resolution surface representation via chemically important surface points, by hashing triangles of physico-chemical properties and by application of hierarchical scoring schemes for a thorough exploration of global and local similarities. We proceed to rigorously apply this method to functional site recognition in three possible ways: first, we search a given functional site on a large set of complete protein structures. Second, a potential functional site on a protein of interest is compared with known binding sites, to recognize similar features. Third, a complete protein structure is searched for the presence of an a priori unknown functional site, similar to known sites. Our method is robust and efficient enough to allow computationally demanding applications such as the first and the third. From the biological standpoint, the first application may identify secondary binding sites of drugs that may lead to side-effects. The third application finds new potential sites on the protein that may provide targets for drug design. Each of the three applications may aid in assigning a function and in classification of binding patterns. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each type of search, provide examples of large-scale searches of the entire Protein Data Base and make functional predictions.","publish_time":"2004-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shulman-Peleg, Alexandra; Nussinov, Ruth; Wolfson, Haim J.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/007ed8e51dede6acd78e9a2a6c5eb64184d8e838.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126412.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283604004139; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604004139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Protein Data Base"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["similar binding sites","functional site recognition","potential functional site","unknown functional site","given functional site","known binding sites","functional predictions","functional classifications","known sites","secondary binding sites of drugs","similar functions","similar features","new potential sites","classification of binding patterns","entire Protein Data Base","large set of complete protein structures","novel method","important surface points","low-resolution surface representation","application of hierarchical scoring schemes","local similarities","fold similarities","type of search","demanding applications","Abstract Recognition of regions","hashing triangles of physico","chemical properties","thorough exploration of global","examples of large-scale searches","speed","presence","proteins","prediction of molecular interactions","sequence","possible ways","disadvantages","SiteEngine","targets","high efficiency","drug design","biological standpoint","side-effects"],"language":"en"},

Since 1976, there have been 885,343 suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of EVD and the disease has claimed 2,512 cases and 932 fatality in West Africa. There are certain requirements that must be met when responding to EVD outbreaks and this process could incur certain challenges. For the purposes of this paper, five have been identified: (i) the deficiency in the development and implementation of surveillance response systems against Ebola and others infectious disease outbreaks in Africa; (ii) the lack of education and knowledge resulting in an EVD outbreak triggering panic, anxiety, psychosocial trauma, isolation and dignity impounding, stigmatisation, community ostracism and resistance to associated socio-ecological and public health consequences; (iii) limited financial resources, human technical capacity and weak community and national health system operational plans for prevention and control responses, practices and management; (iv) inadequate leadership and coordination; and (v) the lack of development of new strategies, tools and approaches, such as improved diagnostics and novel therapies including vaccines which can assist in preventing, controlling and containing Ebola outbreaks as well as the spread of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop and implement an active early warning alert and surveillance response system for outbreak response and control of emerging infectious diseases. Understanding the unending risks of transmission dynamics and resurgence is essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions tailored to specific local settings and contexts. Therefore, the following actions are recommended: (i) national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary surveillance response systems that include early warnings, as well as critical human resources development, must be quickly adopted by allied ministries and organisations in African countries in epidemic and pandemic responses; (ii) harnessing all stakeholders commitment and advocacy in sustained funding, collaboration, communication and networking including community participation to enhance a coordinated responses, as well as tracking and prompt case management to combat challenges; (iii) more research and development in new drug discovery and vaccines; and (iv) understanding the involvement of global health to promote the establishment of public health surveillance response systems with functions of early warning, as well as monitoring and evaluation in upholding research-action programmes and innovative interventions.","publish_time":"2014-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tambo, Ernest; Ugwu, Emmanuel Chidiebere; Ngogang, Jeane Yonkeu","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70f3c90a651224f9292378da905af4ec635d5f43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4130433.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25120913/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-9957-3-29","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","West Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["outbreak response","establishment of public health surveillance response systems","implementation of surveillance response systems","Ebola outbreaks","EVD outbreaks","trans-disciplinary surveillance response systems","public health consequences","public health burden","lack of development","cases of EVD","Ebola virus disease","infectious disease outbreaks","rapid effective response interventions","control responses","involvement of global health","critical human resources development","national health system operational plans","weak community","community ostracism","community participation","early warnings","functions of early warning","pandemic responses","coordinated responses","Ebola haemorrhagic fever","spread","vaccines","West Africa","certain challenges","active early warning alert","Sub-Saharan Africa","control of emerging infectious diseases","innovative interventions","new strategies","financial resources","lack of education","certain requirements","human technical capacity","new drug discovery","prompt case management","upholding research-action programmes","prevention","resurgence","African countries","dignity impounding","sustained funding","psychosocial trauma","isolation","collaboration","communication","stigmatisation","anxiety","specific local settings","socio-ecological","improved diagnostics","advocacy","organisations","approaches","evaluation","epidemic","networking","resistance","tracking","tools","panic","monitoring","unending risks of transmission dynamics","stakeholders commitment","allied ministries","novel therapies","practices","knowledge","process","contexts","inadequate leadership","concern","fatality","laboratory","coordination","deficiency","urgent need","purposes","paper","following actions"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the epidemiology of ECoV and its relationship to diarrhea in foals are poorly understood in Japan. We investigated ECoV in rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in Japan. RESULTS: We collected 337 rectal swabs from 307 diarrheic foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region in Japan, between 2012 and 2014. In addition, 120 rectal swabs were collected from 120 healthy foals in 2012. These samples were tested by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All samples collected from diarrheic foals were negative, and only three samples (2.5 %) collected from healthy foals were positive for ECoV.

Severe disseminated infections with high mortality rates may be seen in immunocompromised individuals. An accurate and cost-effective quantitative assay is essential not only for laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infections, but also for monitoring of response to antiviral treatment. The diagnostic performance of an in-house quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was compared to a commercial system. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy of an in-house adenovirus quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were evaluated against the RealStar\u00AE Adenovirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency testing samples. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of the quantitative results by the in-house assay showed the dynamic range from 2.60 to 9 log(10) (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log(10) (viral transport medium) copies/mL, with the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively. A dilution series demonstrated the limits of detection and lower limits of quantification for plasma were 2.06 log(10) and 2.60 log(10) copies/mL and those for viral transport medium were 2.31 log(10) and 2.94 log(10) copies/mL respectively. The precision of the in-house assay was highly reproducible among runs with coefficients of variance ranging from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for viral transport medium. A comparison of 52 matched samples showed an excellent correlation between the quantitative viral loads measured by the in-house assay and the RealStar\u00AE Adenovirus PCR Kit (R(2) = 0.984), with an average bias of \u2212 0.16 log(10) copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The in-house adenovirus assay is a sensitive and reliable assay with lower cost for the detection and quantification of adenoviral DNA when compared to the RealStar\u00AE Adenovirus PCR Kit.

Cultural processes may change the human selective environment and thereby affect which individuals survive and reproduce. Here, we evaluated whether the modes of subsistence in Native American populations and the frequencies of the ABCA1*Arg230Cys polymorphism were correlated. Further, we examined whether the evolutionary consequences of the agriculturally constructed niche in Mesoamerica could be considered as a gene-culture coevolution model. For this purpose, we genotyped 229 individuals affiliated with 19 Native American populations and added data for 41 other Native American groups (n = 1905) to the analysis. In combination with the SNP cluster of a neutral region, this dataset was then used to unravel the scenario involved in 230Cys evolutionary history. The estimated age of 230Cys is compatible with its origin occurring in the American continent. The correlation of its frequencies with the archeological data on Zea pollen in Mesoamerica/Central America, the neutral coalescent simulations, and the F(ST)-based natural selection analysis suggest that maize domestication was the driving force in the increase in the frequencies of 230Cys in this region.

In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today\u2019s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread.

In this study, we demonstrated that the N protein of SARS-CoV could inhibit IFN-beta (IFN-\u03B2) induced by poly(I:C) or Sendai virus. However, we found that N protein could not inhibit IFN-\u03B2 production induced by overexpression of downstream signaling molecules of two important IFN-\u03B2 induction pathways, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-dependent pathways. These results indicate that SARS-CoV N protein targets the initial step, probably the cellular PRRs (pattern recognition receptors)-RNAs-recognition step in the innate immune pathways, to suppress IFN expression responses. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that N protein did not interact with RIG-I or MDA5. Further, an assay using truncated mutants revealed that the C-terminal domain of N protein was critical for its antagonism of IFN induction, and the N deletion mutant impaired for RNA-binding almost completely lost the IFN-\u03B2 antagonist activity.

This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department. This retrospective study included 134 children 2 years or younger with severe viral bronchiolitis, and 134 healthy age-matched controls. The study period was September 2012 to January 2015. We determined the viral etiology and coinfections with multiple viruses and compared the risk factors detected in children with severe viral bronchiolitis with those in the control group. A total of 153 respiratory viruses in these 134 patients, single or mixed infections, were identified: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A or B was the most frequently detected (23.6% and 17.6%, respectively), followed by rhinovirus (RV; 16.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 (12.4%). Coinfections of 2 respiratory viruses were found in 14.2% of cases; all cases had either RSV type A or B with another virus, the most common being parainfluenza virus or rhinovirus. Exposure to cigarette smoking was independently associated with hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99\u20136.18; P = .0001), and having completed the vaccination schedule for their age was a protective factor against adverse outcome (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35\u20130.87; P = .010). RSV is a common infection among young children with severe bronchiolitis; thus, developing a vaccine against RSV is essential.

However, most conventional hydrogels cannot be injected after gelation and do not support the infiltration of cells because of the static nature of their network structure. Here, we develop unique cell-infiltratable and injectable (Ci-I) gelatin hydrogels, which are physically cross-linked by weak and highly dynamic host\u2013guest complexations and are further reinforced by limited chemical cross-linking for enhanced stability, and then demonstrate the outstanding properties of these Ci-I gelatin hydrogels. The highly dynamic network of Ci-I hydrogels allows injection of prefabricated hydrogels with encapsulated cells and drugs, thereby simplifying administration during surgery. Furthermore, the reversible nature of the weak host\u2013guest cross-links enables infiltration and migration of external cells into Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, thereby promoting the participation of endogenous cells in the healing process. Our findings show that Ci-I hydrogels can mediate sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular drugs (e.g., icaritin) to boost differentiation of stem cells while avoiding the adverse effects (e.g., in treatment of bone necrosis) associated with high drug dosage. The injection of Ci-I hydrogels encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and drug (icaritin) efficiently prevented the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and promoted in situ bone regeneration in an animal model of steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) of the hip by creating the microenvironment favoring the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, including the recruited endogenous cells. We believe that this is the first demonstration on applying injectable hydrogels as effective carriers of therapeutic cargo for treating dysfunctions in deep and enclosed anatomical sites via a minimally invasive procedure.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Qian; Xu, Jiankun; Zhang, Kunyu; Yao, Hao; Zheng, Nianye; Zheng, Lizhen; Wang, Jiali; Wei, Kongchang; Xiao, Xiufeng; Qin, Ling; Bian, Liming","journal":"ACS Cent Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e184094797d77a9169bb3e572c2567ede84535d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/35e9db94099acc5ce344cdf3a2189d69616a12e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6439455.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937371/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00764","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gelatin hydrogels","injectable hydrogels","Biopolymeric hydrogels","conventional hydrogels","infiltration of cells","encapsulated cells","injection of prefabricated hydrogels","carriers of therapeutic cells","differentiation of stem cells","injection of Ci","mesenchymal stem cells","participation of endogenous cells","recruited endogenous cells","migration of external cells","dynamic network of Ci","weak host","dynamic host","icaritin","situ bone regeneration","treatment of bone necrosis","osteogenic differentiation of MSCs","bone mineral density","effective carriers of therapeutic cargo","guest cross-links","static nature","guest complexations","reversible nature","associated osteonecrosis","network structure","sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular drugs","high drug dosage","dysfunctions","animal model of steroid","BMD","enclosed anatomical sites","decrease","SAON","microenvironment","adverse effects","biomedical applications","unique cell-infiltratable","enhanced stability","invasive procedure","healing process","chemical cross-linking","hip","Image","text","outstanding properties","gelation","demonstration","administration","surgery","findings"],"language":"en"},

Two big A/H3N2 pandemics were seen in 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, claiming over 1 million patients in Japan. (3) As herald strains, A/H3N2 strains (A/Sydney-like) were found in October 1999, and B strains (B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like) were detected in July and November 1998 and, in August and December 2000 in Shizuoka. B/Shizuoka/1/98 strain was registered internationally as a vaccine-recommended strain. (4) A/H3N2 and B viruses were detected in 55\u201378% of flu patients (almost under 10 years) with encephalopathy in 1999/2000 and 78\u201391% in 2000/2001 by MDCK and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. (5) High hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers over 40 in 250 persons were shown against A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), A/Yokohama/8/98 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99 (H1N1) strains, while low titers showed against A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), and B/Beijing/243/97, B/Shangdong/7/97 and B/Yamanashi/106/98 strains in 1998\u20132000.

Recently, we showed that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment reduces inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans in the murine gut. Immunotherapy with IVIg could be employed to neutralize COVID-19. However, the efficacy of IVIg would be better if the immune IgG antibodies were collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in the same city, or the surrounding area, in order to increase the chance of neutralizing the virus. These immune IgG antibodies will be specific against COVID-19 by boosting the immune response in newly infected patients. Different procedures may be used to remove or inactivate any possible pathogens from the plasma of recovered coronavirus patient derived immune IgG, including solvent/detergent, 60 \u00B0C heat-treatment, and nanofiltration. Overall, immunotherapy with immune IgG antibodies combined with antiviral drugs may be an alternative treatment against COVID-19 until stronger options such as vaccines are available.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jawhara, Samir","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dac8ac4571d9cbfae358e75bb282163b0e11f31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218340/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21072272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","immune IgG antibodies","immune response","alternative treatment","humans","efficacy of IVIg","Immunotherapy","C heat-treatment","antiviral drugs","plasma of recovered coronavirus patient","novel coronavirus","infected patients","efficient antiviral therapy","single specific vaccine","opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans","overgrowth","China","inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells","severe respiratory tract infections","Wuhan","detergent","solvent","murine gut","stronger options","possible pathogens","intravenous immunoglobulin","order","strains","surrounding area","vaccines","species barrier","emergence","nanofiltration","city","chance","global health concern","animals","Different procedures","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

A 12 mer peptide derived from coronavirus 229E (ETYIKPWWVWL) was the most potent antagonist of the formyl peptide receptor W190 with a K(i) of 230 nM. Fluorescently labeled ETYIKPWWVWL was effectively internalized by all three variants with EC(50) of ~25 nM. An HKU-1 coronavirus peptide, MYVKWPWYVWL, was a potent antagonist but N-formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL was a potent agonist. ETYIKPWWVWL did not stimulate GTP\u03B3S binding but inhibited the stimulation by formyl-NleLeuPhe. It also blocked \u03B2 arrestin translocation and receptor downregulation induced by formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe. This indicates that formyl peptide receptor may be important in viral infections and that variations in its sequence among individuals may affect their likelihood of viral and bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2006-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mills, John S.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc6ee8ae93eb0857d9901a08761432ff77c717ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2075610.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443906000998; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443906000998","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formyl peptide receptor W190","N-formyl","formyl-NleLeuPhe","mer peptide","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus peptide","ETYIKPWWVWL","receptor downregulation","potent antagonists","potent agonist","viral infections","Binding of viral peptides","affinity","MYVKWPWYVWL","fold","likelihood of viral","Leu-Phe","nM","bacterial infections","GTP\u03B3S binding","Ebola virus","membrane proximal region of fusion proteins of human immunodeficiency viruses","Chinese hamster ovary cells","variations","\u03B2 arrestin translocation","extracellular loop-transmembrane helix","interface","sequence","individuals","stimulation","HKU","Substitution of R190","polymorphisms","residues","variants"],"language":"en"},

Although purine itself has never been found in nature, substituted purines, such as adenine and guanine, or their respective nucleoside derivatives, adenosine and guanosine, are the most ubiquitous class of nitrogen heterocycles and play crucial roles in wide variety of functions of living beings As nucleotides (AMP,GMP), they are the building blocks of nucleic acids (RNA/DNA). They serve as energy cofactors (ATP, GTP), as part of coenzymes (NAD/FAD) in oxidation-reduction reactions, as important second messengers in many intracellular signal transduction processes (cAMP/cGMP), or as direct neurotransmitters by binding to purinergic receptors (adenosine receptors). Therefore, it is not surprising that the analogues of purines have found utility both as chemotherapeutics (antiviral, antibiotic, and anticancer agents) and pharmacodynamic entities (the regulation of myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac blood flow). While they can act as substrates or the inhibitors of the enzymes of purine metabolism to render their chemotherapeutic action, their ability to act as agonists or antagonists of A1/A2A receptors is the basis for the modulation of pharmacodynamic property.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosmane, Ramachandra S.","journal":"Progress in Heterocyclic Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97d39bfe3e06cf78bcd9f99269d590f26390805a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959638009700297; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959638009700297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analogues of purines","adenosine receptors","substituted purines","f-purines","purinergic receptors","A2A receptors","pharmacodynamic entities","nucleotide analogues","respective nucleoside derivatives","modulation of pharmacodynamic property","enzymes of purine metabolism","messengers","regulation of myocardial oxygen consumption","wide variety of functions","living beings","crucial roles","intracellular signal transduction processes","cGMP","guanosine","basis","binding","cardiac blood flow","RNA","antiviral","oxidation-reduction reactions","nucleotides","ubiquitous class of nitrogen heterocycles","cAMP","RENTs","anticancer agents","antagonists of A1","direct neurotransmitters","RENs","guanine","building blocks of nucleic acids","broad applications","GTP","chemistry","biology","chapter","NAD","FAD","ability","antibiotic","inhibitors","chemotherapeutic action","family of ring","chemotherapeutics","adenine","utility","energy cofactors","ATP"],"language":"en"},

It involves the installment of either single ubiquitin (Ub) moieties or one of eight different polyUb linkage types, each giving a distinct cellular outcome. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) reverse Ub signaling by disassembly of one or multiple poly-Ub chain types and their malfunction is often associated with human disease. The Ub system displays significant crosstalk with structurally homologous ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls), including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15. This can be seen with the existence of heterogeneous chains made from Ub\u2013Ubl mixtures as well as the proteolytic cross reactivity displayed by several DUBs toward other Ubl systems. In addition, numerous pathogens have been found to encode Ub(l)-ligases and deconjugating enzymes in order to facilitate infection and fight the host immune response. Studying the activity of DUBs and Ubl-specific proteases, both human as well as pathogen-derived, gives fundamental insights into their physiological roles. Activity-based probes (ABPs) have proven to be valuable tools to achieve this, as they report on enzyme activities by making a (often irreversible) covalent complex, rather than on their relative abundance. In this chapter, we explain the potential of ABPs to assess substrate preferences, structural features, and activity of Ub and Ubl deconjugating enzymes. We further demonstrate the practical use of ABPs to (1) characterize the activity of viral proteases toward Ub and Ubls and (2) to gain more insight in the structural determinants of substrate preference of DUBs.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geurink, Paul P.; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Mulder, Monique P.C.; Knaap, Robert C.M.; Kikkert, Marjolein; Ovaa, Huib","journal":"Methods in Enzymology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae0294a3bf36a8f845194ac63d10b1b9d264d5a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112362.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0076687918305342; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2018.12.037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687918305342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30850060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ubl"],"organizations":["SUMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of Ub","reverse Ub","Ub system","activity of DUBs","Ubl deconjugating enzymes","multiple poly-Ub chain types","Ubl mixtures","Ubl systems","Ubl-specific proteases","activity of viral proteases","structural determinants of substrate preference of DUBs","Ubls","Deubiquitinating enzymes","Activity-based probes","potential of ABPs","practical use of ABPs","substrate preferences","structural features","homologous ubiquitin","single ubiquitin","cellular processes","human disease","distinct cellular outcome","different polyUb linkage types","infection","ubiquitination","key role","moieties","significant crosstalk","malfunction","disassembly","posttranslational modification","fundamental insights","SUMO","proteins","proteolytic cross reactivity","order","existence of heterogeneous chains","ligases","physiological roles","host immune response","Nedd8","Abstract Protein","installment","covalent complex","numerous pathogens","addition","ISG15","enzyme activities","relative abundance","valuable tools","chapter"],"language":"en"},

This study assessed the present status of M. pneumoniae infection in Japan and clinical end-points to distinguish children with MR-M. pneumoniae. METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in Fukuoka, Japan in 2010\u201311, a total of 105 children with clinically suspected M. pneumoniae infection were enrolled. M. pneumoniae was analyzed for macrolide resistance in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Sixty -five patients with PCR positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were detected in 81.0% (85 of 105) and M. pneumoniae was identified 61.9% (65 of 105). The resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 89.2% (58 of 65) in this general pediatric outpatient setting. Patients infected with MR-M. pneumoniae showed longer times to resolution of fever and required frequent changes of the initially prescribed macrolide to another antimicrobial agent. We observed three different genotypes of M. pneumoniae including the rarely reported A2063T mutation (A2063G: 31 strains, A2063T: 27 strains, no mutation: 7 strains). Drug susceptibility testing showed different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for each genotype. Serum IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 levels were higher in patients with MR-genotypes than in those infected with no-mutation strains (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance is more common than previously thought and a small epidemic of rarely reported A2063T mutation was observed in Fukuoka, Japan. Furthermore our results reveal the possibility that levels of certain inflammatory cytokines may be a candidate to predict MR-M.pneumoniae infection.","publish_time":"2013-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuda, Kentaro; Narita, Mitsuo; Sera, Nobuyuki; Maeda, Eriko; Yoshitomi, Hideaki; Ohya, Hitomi; Araki, Yuko; Kakuma, Tatsuyuki; Fukuoh, Atsushi; Matsumoto, Kenji","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3193d2eea582b20cce284ead252bc2a33f978203.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3883477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330612/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae infections","prevalence of macrolide resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae","mutation strains","macrolide resistance","MR-genotypes","reported A2063T mutation","Japan","patients","prescribed macrolide","different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles","antimicrobial agents","children","Fukuoka","different genotypes","resistance rate","RESULTS","clinical symptoms","laboratory data","Drug susceptibility testing","clinical end-points","Recent epidemiologic data","levels of certain inflammatory cytokines","resolution of fever","domain V","frequent changes","possibility","efficacy","longer times","A2063G","small epidemic","present status","IP","candidate","outbreak","regard","S rRNA gene","Serum IFN-gamma","general pediatric outpatient setting","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","PCR positive","study","Causative pathogens","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Data sources Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without restrictions on language or publication. Data selection Studies of any intervention to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). A search of study designs included randomised trials, cohort, case-control, crossover, before and after, and time series studies. After scanning of the titles, abstracts and full text articles as a first filter, a standardised form was used to assess the eligibility of the remainder. Risk of bias of randomised studies was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Non-randomised studies were assessed for the presence of potential confounders and classified as being at low, medium, or high risk of bias. Data synthesis 58 papers of 59 studies were included. The quality of the studies was poor for all four randomised controlled trials and most cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggested that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52), wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03), wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06), wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41), wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12), and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The combination was also effective in interrupting the spread of influenza within households. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggested that spread of respiratory viruses can be prevented by hygienic measures in younger children and within households. Evidence that the more uncomfortable and expensive N95 masks were superior to simple surgical masks was limited, but they caused skin irritation. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to reduce respiratory disease remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, were not properly evaluated. Evidence was limited for social distancing being effective, especially if related to risk of exposure\u2014that is, the higher the risk the longer the distancing period. Conclusion Routine long term implementation of some of the measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult. However, many simple and low cost interventions reduce the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. More resources should be invested into studying which physical interventions are the most effective, flexible, and cost effective means of minimising the impact of acute respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2009-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jefferson, Tom; Del Mar, Chris; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Al-Ansary, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada A; van Driel, Mieke L; Foxlee, Ruth; Rivetti, Alessandro","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0835229064e1e12ed616cb7f943b9bc353ceeb13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2749164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773323/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b3675","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of respiratory viruses","transmission of respiratory viruses","Non-randomised studies","NNT","respiratory disease","observational studies","randomised controlled trials","case-control studies","transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses","Data selection Studies","physical measures","spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome","time series studies","highest quality cluster randomised trials","physical interventions","effective means","spread of influenza","simple surgical masks","expensive N95 masks","impact of acute respiratory tract infections","social distancing","hygienic measures","Global measures","risk of exposure","low cost interventions","high risk of bias","normal handwashing","distancing period","Data synthesis","mixed quality","evidence of effectiveness","confidence interval","households","gloves","gowns","allocation concealment","allocation sequence","Data sources Cochrane Library","cohort","OldMedline","barriers","antiseptics","quarantine","isolation","Embase","virucidals","blinding","personal protection","generation","search of study designs","Conclusion Routine long term implementation","filter","text articles","restrictions","CINAHL","times","screening","odds ratio","younger children","Meta-analysis","language","titles","abstracts","incremental effect","hygiene","follow-up","presence of potential confounders","crossover","papers","standardised form","entry ports","eligibility","publication","number","skin irritation","remainder","Objective","combination","resources"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this study were to determine the barriers and supports to implementing MDI/spacer research and to identify factors associated with early and late adoption of MDI/spacers in Canadian PEDs. METHODS: Using a comparative case study design, we classified nine tertiary care pediatric hospital PEDs based on their stage of implementation. Data were collected using focus group interviews with physicians, registered nurses (RNs), and respiratory therapists (RTs), and individual interviews with both patient care and medical directors at each site. Initial coding was based on the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) categories of elements known to influence the uptake of innovations. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty healthcare professionals from nine different healthcare institutions participated in this study. Lack of leadership in the form of a research champion, a lack of consensus about the benefits of MDI/spacers among staff, perceived resistance from patients/parents, and perceived increased cost and workload associated with MDI/spacer use were the most prevalent barriers to the adoption of the MDI/spacer. Common strategies used by early-adopting sites included the active participation of all professional groups in the adoption process in addition to a well-planned and executed educational component for staff, patients, and families. Early adopter sites were also more likely to have the MDI/spacer included in a clinical protocol/pathway. CONCLUSION: Potential barriers and supports to implementation have been identified that will help EDs adopt MDI/spacer use. Future interventions intended to increase MDI/spacer use in PEDs will need to be sensitive to the barriers identified in this study.","publish_time":"2009-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Shannon D; Osmond, Martin H; O\u0027Leary, Kathy A; Graham, Ian D; Grimshaw, Jeremy; Klassen, Terry","journal":"Implement Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c248b6eb16165b2b06281401eaeb99df0ba7f211.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2766417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828086/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-4-65","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spacer use","spacer research","benefits of MDI","late adoption of MDI","spacer devices","spacers","Ottawa Model of Research Use","Canadian PEDs","research champion","recent research","prevalent barriers","Potential barriers","staff","use of metered dose inhalers","tertiary care pediatric hospital PEDs","patients","adoption process","Early adopter sites","comparative case study design","individual interviews","patient care","perceived resistance","healthcare professionals","lack of consensus","Lack of leadership","uptake of innovations","stage of implementation","focus group interviews","perceived increased cost","pediatric emergency departments","different healthcare institutions","registered nurses","physicians","parents","OMRU","workload","professional groups","acute exacerbations of asthma","RNs","addition","factors","medical directors","educational component","respiratory therapists","RTs","active participation","form","categories of elements","clinical protocol","practice","Data","METHODS","Initial coding","Future interventions","pathway","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","families","Common strategies","RESULTS","objectives"],"language":"en"},

All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever \u003E37.5\u00B0C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission.

Our analysis divides poxvirus proteins into categories based on their relative degree of similarity to two different taxonomic subsets of proteins such as all eukaryote vs. all virus (except poxvirus) proteins. As an example, this allows us to identify, based on high similarity to only eukaryote proteins, poxvirus proteins that may have been obtained by horizontal transfer from their hosts. Although this method alone does not definitively prove horizontal gene transfer, it allows us to provide an assessment of the possibility of horizontal gene transfer for every poxvirus protein. Potential candidates can then be individually studied in more detail during subsequent investigation. Results of our analysis demonstrate that in general, proteins encoded by members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae exhibit greater similarity to eukaryote proteins than to proteins of other virus families. In addition, our results reiterate the important role played by host gene capture in poxvirus evolution; highlight the functions of many genes poxviruses share with their hosts; and illustrate which host-like genes are present uniquely in poxviruses and which are also present in other virus families.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odom, Mary R.; Hendrickson, R.

To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454\u00B0C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum. Results from this study indicated dose-dependent increases in the severity of the lesions observed, with few effects in the low-exposure group that were attributable to the exposure.","publish_time":"1986-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springer, David L.; Miller, Rodney A.; Weimer, Walter C.; Ragan, Harvey A.; Buschbom, Ray L.; Mahlum, D.Dennis","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a273f78945e7abadfb6f7b81c540cca8003616b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041008X86904448; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0041008X86904448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant decreases","inhalation exposure","weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations","exposed animals","significant increases","high-dose animals","exposure-related changes","dose-dependent increases","low-exposure group","dose-dependent manner","significant treatment-related decreases","treated animals","consistent decreases","liver weights","SGPT","thymus","bone marrow","study","coal liquefaction materials","systemic effects","ovary weights","body weights","females","total white blood cells","blood urea nitrogen","potential health effects","serum triglyceride amounts","solvent refined coal","Abstract Coal liquids","volume of packed red blood cells","serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase","marrow preparations","Examination of bone","control groups","aerosol of HD","Microscopic evaluation of organ sections","eosinophils","lymphocytes","pulmonary macrophages","hemoglobin","nasal mucosa","erythrocytes","SRC","kidney","sexes","middle","triglycerides","albumin","data base","ovaries","target","degree of cellularity","severity","variety of short-term toxicological assays","boiling range","lactate dehydrogenase","heavy distillate","days","cecum","lesions","liter of air","rats","LDH","studies","controls","Results","Survival","Fischer"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to identify antiviral human microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the Wnt/\u03B2\u2010catenin signalling pathway. Using a miRNA expression library, we identified 85 miRNAs that up\u2010regulated and 20 miRNAs that down\u2010regulated the Wnt/\u03B2\u2010catenin signalling pathway. Fifteen miRNAs were validated to up\u2010regulate and five miRNAs to down\u2010regulate the pathway. Overexpression of four selected miRNAs (miR\u2010193b, miR\u2010548f\u20101, miR\u20101\u20101, and miR\u2010509\u20101) that down\u2010regulated the Wnt/\u03B2\u2010catenin signalling pathway reduced viral mRNA, protein levels in A/PR/8/34\u2010infected HEK293 cells, and progeny virus production. Overexpression of miR\u2010193b in lung epithelial A549 cells also resulted in decreases of A/PR/8/34 infection. Furthermore, miR\u2010193b inhibited the replication of various strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/33, A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and H3N2 (A/Oklahoma/309/2006), as determined by a viral reporter luciferase assay.

Eighty-one acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 86,000 Da were resolved in AcMNPV enveloped virions. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 41,500 and was considered to be the major capsid protein. Nucleocapsids from AcMNPV were resolved into 64 polypeptides. At least 11 of the polypeptides, including most of the high molecular weight proteins, that were not resolved in nucleocapsids were considered to be envelope proteins. For PdMNPV enveloped virions, there were 95 acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 85,500. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 46,500 Da. Polyhedral proteins (polyhedrin) isolated from protease-inactivated polyhedra and separable into a single major polypeptide (approx. 31,000) on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were resolved into six polypeptides for both viruses. All six polyhedrin polypeptides had the same molecular weight, but their isoelectric points ranged from pH 5.3 to 5.9 for AcMNPV and from pH 5.7 to 6.2 for PdMNPV. These six polypeptides were also detected when protease-inactivated or noninactivated whole polyhedra were analyzed directly by 2-D electrophoresis. It is assumed that not all the observed baculovirus polypeptides were unique species.

The aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the fecal microbiota composition in healthy cats compared to FCoV-infected cats, with and without FIP.

In FCoV-positive cats, the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were respectively over- and under-represented, compared to the other groups. Among FIP cats, three subjects shared a similar microbiome, one cat showed a different microbial profile and the other one had the lowest number of diverse phyla.

This review explores how the general phenomenon of an organism rapidly increasing in range or abundance is caused, highlights the similarities and differences between research on EIDs and invasions, and discusses shared management insights and approaches. EIDs can arise by: (i) crossing geographical barriers due to human-mediated dispersal, (ii) crossing compatibility barriers due to evolution, and (iii) lifting of environmental barriers due to environmental change. All these processes can be implicated in biological invasions, but only the first defines them. Research on EIDs is embedded within the One Health concept\u2014the notion that human, animal and ecosystem health are interrelated and that holistic approaches encompassing all three components are needed to respond to threats to human well-being.

Determining parameters that govern pathogen transmission (such as the force of infection, FOI), and pathogen impacts on morbidity and mortality, is exceptionally challenging for wildlife. Vital parameters can vary, for example across host populations, between sexes and within an individual\u0027s lifetime. 2. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus affecting domestic and wild cat species, forming species\u2010specific viral\u2013host associations. FIV infection is common in populations of puma (Puma concolor), yet uncertainty remains over transmission parameters and the significance of FIV infection for puma mortality. In this study, the age\u2010specific FOI of FIV in pumas was estimated from prevalence data, and the evidence for disease\u2010associated mortality was assessed. 3. We fitted candidate models to FIV prevalence data and adopted a maximum likelihood method to estimate parameter values in each model. The models with the best fit were determined to infer the most likely FOI curves. We applied this strategy for female and male pumas from California, Colorado, and Florida. 4. When splitting the data by sex and area, our FOI modeling revealed no evidence of disease\u2010associated mortality in any population. Both sex and location were found to influence the FOI, which was generally higher for male pumas than for females. For female pumas at all sites, and male pumas from California and Colorado, the FOI did not vary with puma age, implying FIV transmission can happen throughout life; this result supports the idea that transmission can occur from mothers to cubs and also throughout adult life. For Florida males, the FOI was a decreasing function of puma age, indicating an increased risk of infection in the early years, and a decreased risk at older ages. 5. This research provides critical insight into pathogen transmission and impact in a secretive and solitary carnivore. Our findings shed light on the debate on whether FIV causes mortality in wild felids like puma, and our approach may be adopted for other diseases and species. The methodology we present can be used for identifying likely transmission routes of a pathogen and also estimating any disease\u2010associated mortality, both of which can be difficult to establish for wildlife diseases in particular.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Jennifer J.

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term.

Here, we report the identification of Sec16A and p115, two proteins of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system, as novel components of the TRAF3 interactome network. Notably, in non-infected cells, TRAF3 was found associated with markers of the ER-Exit-Sites (ERES), ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-Golgi apparatus. Upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing however, the Golgi apparatus fragmented into cytoplasmic punctated structures containing TRAF3 allowing its colocalization and interaction with Mitochondrial AntiViral Signaling (MAVS), the essential mitochondria-bound RIG-I-like Helicase (RLH) adaptor. In contrast, retention of TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system blunted the ability of TRAF3 to interact with MAVS upon viral infection and consequently decreased type I IFN response. Moreover, depletion of Sec16A and p115 led to a drastic disorganization of the Golgi paralleled by the relocalization of TRAF3, which under these conditions was unable to associate with MAVS. Consequently, upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing, ablation of Sec16A and p115 was found to inhibit IRF3 activation and anti-viral gene expression. Reciprocally, mild overexpression of Sec16A or p115 in Hec1B cells increased the activation of IFN\u03B2, ISG56 and NF-\u03BAB -dependent promoters following viral infection and ectopic expression of MAVS and Tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). In line with these results, TRAF3 was found enriched in immunocomplexes composed of p115, Sec16A and TBK1 upon infection. Hence, we propose a model where dsDNA and dsRNA sensing induces the formation of membrane-bound compartments originating from the Golgi, which mediate the dynamic association of TRAF3 with MAVS leading to an optimal induction of innate immune responses.","publish_time":"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Zuylen, Wendy J.; Doyon, Priscilla; Cl\u00E9ment, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Khan, Kashif Aziz; D\u0027Ambrosio, Lisa M.; D\u00F4, Florence; St-Amant-Verret, Myriam; Wissanji, Tasheen; Emery, Gregory; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Meloche, Sylvain; Servant, Marc J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6b79474869aa89ef3a3cab01f39abac279c5132.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3390413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22792062/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mitochondrial AntiViral Signaling","MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p115","ability of TRAF3","retention of TRAF3","relocalization of TRAF3","TRAF3 interactome network","dynamic association of TRAF3","dsRNA sensing","cis-Golgi apparatus","Golgi vesicular transport system","viral infection","Golgi intermediate compartment","dsDNA sensing","ablation of Sec16A","depletion of Sec16A","identification of Sec16A","ectopic expression of MAVS","ER-Exit","mild overexpression of Sec16A","IFN response","TBK1","anti-viral gene expression","inducing type","activation of IFN\u03B2","IRF3 activation","decreased type","Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-associated factor","Hec1B cells","bound compartments","non-infected cells","essential mitochondria-bound RIG","novel components","interferon","dependent promoters","NF-\u03BAB","colocalization","production","intracellular double-stranded RNA","central mediator important","cytoplasmic punctated structures","formation of membrane","ISG56","interaction","ERGIC","optimal induction of innate immune responses","Tank-binding kinase","Helicase","Mitochondrial AntiViral","Sites","ERES","drastic disorganization","markers","conditions","model","proteins","immunocomplexes","RLH","adaptor","line","results","contrast"],"language":"en"},

This constitutes wastage, raising economic, environmental and ethical questions. We review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested. We focus on four main explanations: predation, disease, starvation and dispersal, and highlight other important causes of mortality. For each explanation, we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest. We review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them. Opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced, the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released. We found few studies investigating impacts of post-release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a UK context. We found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early-life, pre-release management may improve survival. Given the scale of pheasant releasing in the UK, even improvements in survival of 1% would mean that ~ 350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes. Complementing current post-release management with proven novel pre-release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release, whilst maintaining current shooting levels. Lowering release numbers would lower financial costs, benefit the environment and reduce some ethical concerns over the release and shooting of reared pheasants.

Many studies have shown that transient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or adenovirus-mediated RNA interfere (RNAi) could potentially inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in vivo and in vitro. Here, we applied RNAi to produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed PRRSV-specific siRNA derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). First, we evaluated siRNA expression in the founding and F1 generation pigs and confirmed stable transmission. Then, we detected the expression of IFN-\u03B2 and protein kinase R (PKR) and found no difference among TG, non-transgenic (NTG), and wild-type pigs. Lastly, the F1 generation pigs, including TG and NTG piglets, were challenged with 3\u00D7104.5 TCID50 of JXA1, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV). Our results showed that the in vivo siRNA expression substantially reduced the serum HP-PRRSV titers and increased survival time by 3 days when TG pigs were compared with the NTG controls. These data suggested that RNAi-based genetic modification might be used to breed viral-resistant livestock with stable siRNA expression with no complications of siRNA toxicity.","publish_time":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Li; Li, Qiuyan; Bao, Yonghua; Li, Jinxiu; Chen, Zhisheng; Yu, Xiuling; Zhao, Yaofeng; Tian, Kegong; Li, Ning","journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2ce4781ae89af297f6246665086090074b78a9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127135.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613005270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333125/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168165613005270; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TG","NTG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TG pigs","stable siRNA expression","PRRSV-specific siRNA","F1 generation pigs","RNAi","respiratory syndrome virus","complications of siRNA toxicity","expression of IFN","wild-type pigs","serum HP-PRRSV titers","small hairpin RNA","NTG piglets","NTG controls","adenovirus-mediated RNA","transient delivery of small interfering RNA","stable transmission","devastating viral disease","viral-resistant livestock","increased survival time","heavy losses","protein kinase R","PKR","days","founding","difference","replication","swine industry","TCID50 of JXA1","genetic modification","shRNA","studies","data","results"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study was to obtain current data about the frequency of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. in diarrhoeic calves in Southern Germany with the particular focus on giardiosis. RESULTS: 1564 samples were analysed for the three pathogens using microscopical methods. Giardia spp. was detectable in 112/1564 samples (7.2%). The mean age was 46.5 days and the odds of being infected with Giardia spp. increased slowly up to 8 times from about 12 days to 30 days of age. There appeared to be no seasonal influence on the frequency of Giardia spp. A mono-infection with Giardia spp. was diagnosed in 46 calves (2.9%) whereas 15 calves (1.0%) had a mixed-infection with Cryptosporidium spp. and 51 calves (3.3%) with Eimeria spp. Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. could be detected in 646/1564 samples (41.3%) and 208/1564 samples (13.3%), respectively, with a mean age of 11.3 and 55.0 days, respectively. The odds of being infected with Cryptosporidium spp. increased up to 4.5 times until an age of 10 days. After that the odds decreased continuously and was approaching zero at about 30 days. The odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. increased continuously up to 30 times from about 20 days to 60 days of age. There appeared to be no significant seasonal influence on the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp.; but there was one for Eimeria spp.: the odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. in March and April decreased by about half and increased up to 2.3 times between July and September. Additionally, as requested by the veterinarians, 1282 of those samples were analysed for E. coli, Rota-, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. using an ELISA. Obtained frequencies for these pathogens were 0.9%, 37.8%, 3.4% and 45.3% with a mean age of 24.8 days, 12.1 days, 9.0 days and 12.1 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that in Southern Germany in addition to Eimeria spp., Giardia spp. seems to play a contributing role in diarrhoea in older calves, whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Rotavirus are mostly relevant in young calves.","publish_time":"2014-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gillhuber, Julia; R\u00FCgamer, David; Pfister, Kurt; Scheuerle, Miriam C","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d2c66f3c30a2fd8f14f75c3f5405e2ba61b9345.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3941484.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eimeria","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern Germany"],"keyphrases":["days of age","Eimeria","frequency of Cryptosporidium","odds","samples","frequency of Giardia","mean age","older calves","diarrhoeic calves","rearing of calves","young calves","times","Southern Germany","Diarrhoea","pathogens","RESULTS","significant seasonal influence","mono-infection","mixed-infection","massive problems","Rotavirus","particular focus","contributing role","Coronavirus","current data","addition","study","giardiosis","BACKGROUND","coli","microscopical methods","ELISA","aim","frequencies","CONCLUSIONS","veterinarians"],"language":"en"},

In this observational study, we retrospectively analyzed the results of all the respiratory samples, which had been processed during 1 year-period (November 2015 to November 2016) with the FA-RP, in the Central Laboratories of Hygeia \u0026 Mitera General Hospitals of Athens, Greece. In order to have an age-related distribution, the following age groups were implemented: (\u003C2), (\u22652, \u003C5), (\u22655, \u003C10), (\u226510, \u003C18), (\u226518, \u003C45), (\u226545, \u003C65), and (\u226565) years old. Among 656 respiratory samples tested, 362 (55%) were from male and 294 (45%) from female patients, while 356 (54.3%) were positive and 300 (45.7%) negative. In the first age-group (\u003C2), 41/121 samples (33.9%) revealed human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV) and 16 (13.2%) adenovirus (Adv), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (Hmpv), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV). In the age-group (\u22652, \u003C5), Adv predominated with 37/147 samples (25.2%), followed by HRV, RSV, coronavirus (all types), and influenza, Hmpv and PIV. In the age-group (\u22655, \u003C10), HRV was identified in 25/80 samples (31.3%), Adv in 18 (22.5%), influenza in 11 (13.8%), and Hmpv in 6 (7.5%). Influenza predominated in the age-group (\u226510, \u003C18), with 4/22 samples (18.2%), while in the remaining age-groups (\u226518), HRV was the commonest isolated pathogen, 33/286 (11.5%), followed by influenza with 20 (7%) (influenza A H1-2009, 11/20). In our patient series, HRV seemed to prevail in most age-groups, followed by Adv, although Influenza was the second most frequent pathogen isolated in the age-groups (\u226518). Moreover, increasing age corresponded to increasing possibility of having a negative sample, indicating that FilmArray may be more useful before adolescence.","publish_time":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsagarakis, Nikolaos J.; Sideri, Anthi; Makridis, Panagiotis; Triantafyllou, Argyro; Stamoulakatou, Alexandra; Papadogeorgaki, Eleni","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dc475f4419836c2dc352073498f56ae982170a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6392546.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000010903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","PIV","Influenza"],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","HRV","following age groups","remaining age-groups","Adv","Hmpv","FilmArray Respiratory Panel","respiratory syncytial virus","coronavirus","RSV","FA-RP","upper respiratory tract infections","PIV","commonest isolated pathogen","age-related distribution","human metapneumovirus","parainfluenza viruses","age-related prevalence","human rhinovirus","frequent pathogen","negative sample","Mitera General Hospitals of Athens","Central Laboratories of Hygeia","bacteria responsible","FDA certified multiplex PCR","Greece","types","assessment","enterovirus","possibility","results","pathogens","order","adolescence","patient series","observational study","year-period","years old","female patients","adenovirus","H1"],"language":"en"},

Coelomocytes are the freely circulating cells in the body fluid contained in echinoderm coelom and mediate the cellular defence responses to immune challenges by phagocytosis, encapsulation, cytotoxicity and the production of antimicrobial agents. Coelomocytes have the ability to recognize self from non-self. Considering that sialic acids play important roles in immunity, we determined the presence of sialic acid types in coelomocytes of Paracentrotus lividus. Homogenized coelomocytes were kept in 2 M aqueous acetic acid at 80 \u00B0C for 3 h to liberate sialic acids. Sialic acids were determined by derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenediaoxy-benzene dihydrochloride (DMB) followed by capillary liquid-chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry (CapLC-ESI-MS/MS). Standard sialic acids; Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, KDN and bovine submaxillary mucin showing a variety of sialic acids were used to confirm sialic acids types.

In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.

However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC(50) value was observed in TSL-1\u2013treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1\u2013induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along with doublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.","publish_time":"2010-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Chih-Jen; Huang, Yu-Jung; Wang, Cheng-Yuan; Wang, Pei-Hui; Hsu, Hseng-Kuang; Tsai, May-Jywan; Chen, Yu-Chu; Bharath Kumar, V.; Huang, Ming-Shyan; Weng, Ching-Feng","journal":"Transl Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18e0f53c82db254bfa884517bef263d9e8fecc53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185486.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524410000563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2010.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20478545/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524410000563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Toona"],"organizations":["NSCLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell lines","cell morphology","weeks of TSL","tumoricidal effect of TSL","lung large cell carcinoma","lung squamous cell carcinoma","cell-cycle regulators","small-cell lung cancer","cell-cycle arrest","cancer cells","Exposure of NSCLC cells","H520 cells","H661 cells","H441 cells","lung adenocarcinoma","NSCLC growth","treatment","TS leaves","cytotoxic effect","decreased Bcl2 protein level","increased Bax protein level","subG1 phase","TS leaf extract fraction","induced apoptosis","Cedrela sinensis","Toona sinensis","IC50 value","subG1 peak accumulation","terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end","inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome","LDL glycative activity","antioxidant activities","hypoglycemic effects","CDK4 proteins","adenosine diphosphate","Annexin-V double staining","cleavage","ribose","SARS","cyclin D1","p27 expression","propidium iodide","wide range of biologic functions","PARP","polymerase","ADP","various regimen","coronavirus replication","potent inhibitor","provoking result","singlet","taxane","vinorelbine","doublet agents","TUNEL","Meliaceae family","compounds","molecular mechanism","dose-dependent manner","regression of tumor","gemcitabine","better nutriceutical","xenograft model","assay","study","treated H661cells","studies"],"language":"en"},

Results We found that viral peak titres in lungs of dKO and STAT1-deficient mice were similar, although significantly higher than in wild-type mice. The kinetics of viral clearance from the lung was also comparable in dKO and STAT1-deficient mice.

In parallel, most viroporins identified so far are virulence factors, and interest has focused toward the discovery of channel inhibitors that would have a therapeutic effect, or be used as research tools to understand the biological roles of viroporin ion channel activity. However, this paradigm is being shifted by the difficulties inherent to small viral membrane proteins, and by the realization that protein\u2013protein interactions and other diverse roles in the virus life cycle may represent an equal, if not, more important target. Therefore, although targeting the channel activity of viroporins can probably be therapeutically useful in some cases, the focus may shift to their other functions in following years. Small-molecule inhibitors have been mostly developed against the influenza A M2 (IAV M2 or AM2). This is not surprising since AM2 is the best characterized viroporin to date, with a well-established biological role in viral pathogenesis combined the most extensive structural investigations conducted, and has emerged as a validated drug target. For other viroporins, these studies are still mostly in their infancy, and together with those for AM2, are the subject of the present review.","publish_time":"2016-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Janet; Surya, Wahyu; Torres, Jaume","journal":"Adv Protein Chem Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf25a09ac9c485d7d8d40a9fd9c2caecb1936a13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102763.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apcsb.2015.12.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876162315001005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038378/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876162315001005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["channel activity of viroporins","AM2","biological roles of viroporin ion channel activity","specific biological roles","discovery of channel inhibitors","certain small viral membrane proteins","diverse roles","viral pathogenesis","Small-molecule inhibitors","well-established biological role","protein interactions","ion channels","IAV M2","important target","best characterized viroporin","validated drug target","difficulties inherent","virus life cycle","realization","host cellular membranes","extensive structural investigations","research tools","functions","focus","subject","therapeutic effect","influenza","feature","following years","present review","cases","attempts","studies","virulence factors","infancy","paradigm"],"language":"en"},

In addition, we describe the practical application of these resources to the recent MERS outbreak and the progress in preventive measures. The spread of MERS demonstrated that the general readiness for emerging infectious diseases in Korea is considerably low. We believe that it is essential to increase society\u2019s investment in disease prevention. Fostering public health personnel, legislating management policies, and establishing research centers for emerging infectious diseases are potential solutions. Evaluating international preventive systems, developing cooperative measures, and initiating improvements are necessary.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Vincent; Zhou, Xiaoyan; Marshall, Edith; Jia, Beibei; Fusheng, Guo; FrancoDixon, Mary Ann; DeHaan, Nicoline; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Soares Magalh\u00E3es, Ricardo J.; Gilbert, Marius","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587711002339; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587711002339","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI","HPAIV"],"locations":["China","Guangdong","South China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["HPAIV H5N1 infection","HPAIV H5N1 presence","presence of HPAIV H5N1","LBMs","poultry sector","associated risk of HPAIV H5N1","subtype H5N1","South China","poultry production sector","social network indicators","live poultry trade","LBM network configuration","HPAI control","movement control","poultry market chains","specific network configurations","use of social network analysis","set of LBM network maps","effective control interventions","viral infection","study","better knowledge of poultry trading patterns","daily cage cleaning","daily cage disinfection","new insights","new information","traditional live bird markets","combination","epidemiological surveillance","areas","biosecurity factors","manure processing","reduction","success of current strategies","pathogenic avian influenza virus","wide-scale preventive vaccination","decades","capacity","phase of tremendous growth","rapid intensification","association","public health hazard","people","results","number of outbreaks","evidence","birds","quarantine","Guangdong province","counties of origin","significant importance","concentration","years","Abstract","Asia","disease","strategy"],"language":"en"},

To assess whether co\u2010detections of other common respiratory viruses are associated with increased severity of HRSV illnesses from patients who were shedding viable\u2010HRSV, nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 5 years who sought medical care for respiratory infections in Ribeir\u00E3o Preto (Brazil) were tested for HRSV by immunofluorescence, RT\u2010PCR and virus isolation in cell culture. All samples with viable\u2010HRSV were tested further by PCR for other respiratory viruses. HRSV\u2010disease severity was assessed by a clinical score scale. A total of 266 samples from 247 children were collected and 111 (42%) were HRSV\u2010positive. HRSV was isolated from 70 (63%), and 52 (74%) of them were positive for at least one additional virus.

Methods A literature search was performed using Pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia, RAS and COVID-19, and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications. Results The RAS has an essential role in glucose homeostasis and may have a role in COVID-19-induced lung injury. Some antihyperglycemic medications modulate RAS and might hypothetically alleviate the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on lung injury. Furthermore, most antihyperglycemic medications showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of lung injury. Conclusions Some antihyperglycemic medications might have protective effects against COVID-19-induced lung injury. Early insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakhleh, Afif; Shehadeh, Naim","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11954b84ab4d75806de1f3e6a5b6204056a41a54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388330/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301053?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301053; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","effects of antihyperglycemic medications","RAS","induced lung injury","alleviating lung injury","animal models of lung injury","antihyperglycemic drugs","anti-inflammatory effects","protective effects","renin-angiotensin system","deleterious effect of angiotensin","severe course of coronavirus disease","essential role","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ACE2","receptor","SARS-CoV","glucose homeostasis","Pubmed","host cell entry","Early insulin therapy","interrelationships","hyperglycemia","Diabetes mellitus","putative roles","literature search","Abstract Background","enzyme","interactions","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with \u003E99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24\u20133.58.

However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Chih-Cheng; Shih, Tzu-Ping; Ko, Wen-Chien; Tang, Hung-Jen; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a006cb9a90f0625f548c5775891d395860c81c75.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3a09ecb4e0ce830f5cd2279e2d722773ff853d1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127800.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920300674; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32081636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","USA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","novel coronavirus pneumonia","case of SARS","China","public health authorities","bat-SL","Wuhan pneumonia","major public health issue","bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","public health emergency of international concern","novel virus","World Health Organization","infection","COVID","common finding","associated outbreak","common symptom","human transmission","confirmed cases","large global outbreak","coronaviruses","days","ground-glass opacity","CoVZC45","computed tomography images","droplets","direct contact","fever","Bilateral lung involvement","nCoV","mean incubation period","basic reproduction number","chest","data","disease","CoVZXC21","USA","countries","cough","clinical trial","end","situation","primary intervention","patients","regions","remdesivir"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To molecularly characterise a novel HRV and determine its prevalence and clinical impact on a predominantly paediatric population. STUDY DESIGN: Nucleotide sequencing was employed to determine the complete HRV-QPM coding sequence. Two novel real-time RT-PCR diagnostic assays were designed and employed to retrospectively screen a well-defined population of 1244 specimen extracts to identify the prevalence of HRV-QPM during 2003. RESULTS: Phylogenetic studies of complete coding sequences defined HRV-QPM as a novel member the genus Rhinovirus residing within the previously described HRV-A2 sub-lineage. Investigation of the relatively short VP1 sequence suggest that the virus is resistant to Pleconaril, setting it apart from the HRV A species. Sixteen additional HRV-QPM strains were detected (1.4% of specimens) often as the sole micro-organism present among infants with suspected bronchiolitis. HRV-QPM was also detected in Europe during 2006, and a closely related virus circulated in the United States during 2004.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the duration of cough and prevalence of PIC and its relation with acute symptoms, airway inflammation and cough sensitivity in patients with H1N1 influenza. METHODS: Patients with acute symptoms of H1N1 influenza were enrolled and followed up until cough relived. Spirometry, induced sputum test, capsaicin challenge test were conducted in patients with PIC. Cough sensitivity was presented as logarithm of provocative concentration inducing five or more coughs (logC5). RESULTS: A total of 141 cases with H1N1 influenza were enrolled. In patients with H1N1 influenza, 97.2% of them complained cough. The duration of cough was as following: \u003C1 week (73.0%); 1\u20132 weeks (7.8%); 2\u20133 weeks (7.8%); \u22653 weeks (8.5%). Twelve (8.5%) patients had cough lasting more than 3 weeks (PIC), 4 (2.8%) patients developed chronic cough (\u003E8 weeks). Acute symptoms, spirometry, bronchial responsiveness and sputum differential cell count were similar between patients with PIC and those without PIC, however, there was a higher prevalence of previous PIC (58.3% vs 14.7%, P \u003C 0.05) and elevated cough sensitivity (lgC5: 1.18 \u00B1 0.58 vs 2.73 \u00B1 0.33, P \u003C 0.01) in patients with PIC as compared with the patients without PIC. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cough is common in patients with H1N1 PIC, only a few of patients develop chronic cough. Acute symptoms cannot predict PIC which is related with previous PIC and increased cough sensitivity.","publish_time":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ling; Yang, Zi\u2010Feng; Zhan, Yang\u2010Qing; Luo, Wei; Liu, Bao\u2010Juan; Pan, Jia\u2010Yu; Yi, Fang; Chen, Ru\u2010Chong; Lai, Ke\u2010Fang","journal":"Clin Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7014fbb6edbbf09e1c50998cae53e85b5d356f7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162306.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26519198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","Acute cough","cough duration","duration of cough","H1N1 PIC","chronic cough","prevalence of PIC","elevated cough sensitivity","increased cough sensitivity","prevalence of postinfectious cough","acute symptoms of H1N1 influenza","weeks","higher prevalence of previous PIC","common symptoms of influenza","Spirometry","vs","induced sputum test","capsaicin challenge test","sputum differential cell count","bronchial responsiveness","airway inflammation","relation","viral upper respiratory tract infection","cases","total","lgC5","logarithm of provocative concentration","coughs","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","logC5","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Highly attenuated recombinant HIV vaccinia virus can be administered mucosally, but even high doses of immunization have been found unable to induce strong mucosal antibody responses. In order to solve this problem, we studied the interactions of recombinant HIV vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (rVTT-gagpol) in mucosal epithelial cells (specifically Caco-2 cell layers) and in BALB/c mice. We evaluated the impact of this virus on HIV antigen delivery and specific immune responses. The results demonstrated that rVTT-gagpol was able to infect Caco-2 cell layers and both the nasal and lung epithelia in BALB/c mice. The progeny viruses and expressed p24 were released mainly from apical surfaces. In BALB/c mice, the infection was limited to the respiratory system and was not observed in the blood. This showed that polarized distribution limited antigen delivery into the whole body and thus limited immune response. To see if this could be improved upon, we stimulated unpolarized budding of the virus and HIV antigens by treating both Caco-2 cells and BALB/c mice with colchicine. We found that, in BALB/c mice, the degree of infection and antigen expression in the epithelia went up. As a result, specific immune responses increased correspondingly. Together, these data suggest that polarized budding limits antigen delivery and immune responses, but unpolarized distribution can increase antigen expression and delivery and thus enhance specific immune responses. This conclusion can be used to optimize mucosal HIV vaccine strategies.","publish_time":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yan; Yang, Jingyi; Bao, Rong; Chen, Yaoqing; Zhou, Dihan; He, Benxia; Zhong, Maohua; Li, Yaoming; Liu, Fang; Li, Qiaoli; Yang, Yi; Han, Chen; Sun, Ying; Cao, Yuan; Yan, Huimin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25615501bc9f54fd01b72047cec1f8ec619b1e69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3174162.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21935396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV antigen delivery","BALB","c mice","specific immune responses","antigen expression","HIV antigens","strong mucosal immune response","polarized distribution limited antigen delivery","attenuated recombinant HIV vaccinia virus","mucosal HIV vaccine strategies","strong mucosal antibody responses","Caco","polarized budding limits antigen delivery","successful HIV vaccines","interactions of recombinant HIV vaccinia virus Tiantan strain","mucosal epithelial cells","rVTT-gagpol","unpolarized budding","unpolarized distribution","cell layers","degree of infection","lung epithelia","nasal","p24","data","induction","impact","colchicine","high doses of immunization","apical surfaces","progeny viruses","problem","respiratory system","results","order","conclusion","blood"],"language":"en"},

CASE PRESENTATION: A total of 284 nasal swabs were collected during symptomatic (196 specimens) and asymptomatic (88 specimens) periods of respiratory symptoms from a young female child (from 4 months to 31 months of age, who was admitted to a nursery school at 9 months). Multiplex real-time PCR for 19 respiratory viruses or subtypes was performed. One hundred and ninety-eight of the tested specimens were virus positive (69.7 %) (symptomatic periods, 149/196, 76.0 %; asymptomatic periods, 49/88, 55.7 %). Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected (26 times). Long durations of detection were observed for human coronavirus NL63 (30 days), rhinovirus (28 days) and human bocavirus 1 (22 days).

In the last 10 years, many national and international guidelines on the treatment of pediatric CAP have been published, in order to optimize the prescription of antibiotics and limit their cost and side effects. However, the practical implementation of these guidelines is still limited. MAIN TEXT: We analyzed the current recommendations for the therapy of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that all converge on the identification of aminopenicillins and beta-lactams as the optimal treatment for CAP. We also conducted a review of the current literature on antibiotic regimens used for pediatric CAP to identify the current state of guidelines implementation in different settings. We selected 37 studies published from 2010 to 2016, including both retrospective and prospective studies, mainly cross-sectional and hospital based. The results show a global heterogeneity in the antibiotics prescription for pediatric CAP, with application of guidelines varying from 0% to more than 91% and with important differences even within the same country. CONCLUSIONS: Our review has demonstrated that the implementation of the guidelines is still limited but also that achieving the optimal prescription is possible and can be done in both developed and developing countries.","publish_time":"2017-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Don\u00E0, Daniele; Luise, Dora; Da Dalt, Liviana; Giaquinto, Carlo","journal":"Int J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c8c10da93fecd1d2a2a75fdac68d479a1d6135e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5694995.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4239268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of pediatric CAP","current state of guidelines implementation","international guidelines","application of guidelines","prescription of antibiotics","antibiotics prescription","optimal prescription","therapy of pediatric community","current recommendations","current literature","Pneumonia","optimal treatment","practical implementation","review","countries","important threat","important differences","prospective studies","antibiotic regimens","beta-lactams","global heterogeneity","different settings","children\u0027s health","identification of aminopenicillins","hospital","BACKGROUND","years","cost","order","MAIN TEXT","results","country","effects","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Population and methods Nasal and pharyngeal swabs from adult outpatients with ILI attending the emergency room during the winter seasons of 2004 and 2005 in Argentina were evaluated by immunofluorescence and RT\u2010PCR. Results Of 151 samples analyzed, 39 (26%) were influenza A positive, 5 (3\u00B73%) influenza B positive and 4 (2\u00B76%) respiratory syncytial virus positive by immunofluorescence. Two samples (1\u00B73%) were human metapneumovirus positive by RT PCR. Cell culture detected six additional influenza viruses and one adenovirus positive sample. The sensitivity of immunofluorescence for influenza compared with culture was 70%. Symptoms did not predict etiology. Conclusions In this study, 40% of the patients with ILI had a specific viral infection and 83% were influenza viruses. Viral detection was necessary to determine the etiology as signs and symptoms were not different between patients with or without viral infection.

Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens, but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously, with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often, pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host, for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors, to escape the immune response, or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this, and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen\u0027s fitness, and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring. Here we examine how these evolutionary factors affect patterns of host shifts and disease emergence.","publish_time":"2014-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Longdon, Ben; Brockhurst, Michael A.; Russell, Colin A.; Welch, John J.; Jiggins, Francis M.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5ca488c67d3b9db4056f7fe900e10254d69f7ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4223060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel host","host species","original host","natural host","particular host","patterns of host shifts","pathogens","novel species","sequence changes","susceptibility of potential new hosts","product","time","pathogen jumps","frequent event","different cell surface receptors","example","evolutionary factors","disease emergence","close relatives","aspects","Emerging viral diseases","cost","Phylogenetic studies","pathogen\u0027s fitness","immune response","viruses","molecular solutions"],"language":"en"},

Different kinds of DNA vaccines are investigated to provide protection against respiratory infectious diseases including tuberculosis, coronavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) etc. DNA vaccines have several attractive development potential, such as producing cross-protection towards different virus subtypes, enabling the possibility of mass manufacture in a relatively short time and a better safety profile. The biggest obstacle to DNA vaccines is low immunogenicity. One of the approaches to enhance the efficacy of DNA vaccine is to improve DNA delivery efficiency.

These findings suggest that adenoviruses may stimulate specific pattern recognition receptors in an entry/trafficking-dependent manner, leading to distinct immune responses dependent on the virus/cell type combination.

CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the case of an RSV-associated death of a child who was born at full-term and developed normally up to the age of 2 years old. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred within 3 days after the onset of symptoms, which included cough and high fever. Complete brain edema was prominent, and encephalopathy was developing. Viral antigen detection and microbiome analyses of oral swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens verified an RSV infection, while bacterial culture of blood specimens yielded negative results. The RSV strain detected in this patient was subtyped as RSVB9, and no mutation was found in the six antigenic sites for targeted drugs or vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The patient had a severe infection associated with RSV, which was very likely the cause of her central nervous system infection and acute neurological complications.","publish_time":"2018-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Lili; Gao, Hengmiao; Zeng, Jiansheng; Liu, Jun; Lu, Cong; Guan, Xiaolei; Qian, Suyun; Xie, Zhengde","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a21809b3622fbd0f1a0ef01eab221fb05ada15e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5948794.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3123-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","RSV strain","RSV-associated death","severe infection","patient","central nervous system infection","high mortality","high fever","severe sequelae","CASE PRESENTATION","full-term children","common viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis","nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens","Viral antigen detection","bacterial culture of blood specimens","premature birth","prolonged morbidity","microbiome analyses of oral swab","bronchopulmonary dysplasia","congenital heart disease","acute neurological complications","antigenic sites","negative results","Risk factors","days","targeted drugs","vaccines","cough","pneumonia","BACKGROUND","Respiratory syncytial virus","Complete brain edema","onset of symptoms","encephalopathy","syndrome","report","hospitalization","age","years old","Cardiopulmonary arrest","mutation","RSVB9","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"}]}

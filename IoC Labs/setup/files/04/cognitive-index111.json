Interventions designed to prevent the spread of respiratory infection within family physician (FP) offices could potentially have a significant positive influence on the health of Canadians. The main purpose of this paper is to estimate the explicit costs of such an intervention. METHODS: A cost analysis of a respiratory infection control was conducted. The costs were estimated from the perspective of provincial government. In addition, a threshold analysis was conducted to estimate a threshold value of the intervention\u0027s effectiveness that could generate potential savings in terms of averted health-care costs by the intervention that exceed the explicit costs. The informational requirements for these implicit costs savings are high, however. Some of these elements, such as the cost of hospitalization in the event of contacting influenza, and the number of patients passing through the physicians\u0027 office, were readily available. Other pertinent points of information, such as the proportion of infected people who require hospitalization, could be imported from the existing literature. We take an indirect approach to calculate a threshold value for the most uncertain piece of information, namely the reduction in the probability of the infection spreading as a direct result of the intervention, at which the intervention becomes worthwhile. RESULTS: The 5-week intervention costs amounted to a total of $52,810.71, or $131,094.73 prorated according to the length of the flu season, or $512,729.30 prorated for the entire calendar year. The variable costs that were incurred for this 5-week project amounted to approximately $923.16 per participating medical practice. The (fixed) training costs per practice were equivalent to $73.27 for the 5-week intervention, or $28.14 for 13-week flu season, or $7.05 for an entire one-year period. CONCLUSION: Based on our conservative estimates for the direct cost savings, there are indications that the outreach facilitation intervention program would be cost effective if it can achieve a reduction in the probability of infection on the order of 0.83 (0.77, 1.05) percentage points. A facilitation intervention initiative tailored to the environment and needs of the family medical practice and walk-in clinics is of promise for improving respiratory infection control in the physicians\u0027 offices.","publish_time":"2007-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hogg, William; Gray, David; Huston, Patricia; Zhang, Wei","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d355f050721e1e9d9288c7824cc38546b6ef2a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2204002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2204002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["week intervention costs","explicit costs","training costs","variable costs","respiratory infection control","probability of infection","implicit costs savings","epidemic respiratory infection","spread of respiratory infection","facilitation intervention initiative","direct cost savings","outreach facilitation intervention program","cost analysis","cost of hospitalization","week flu season","terms of averted health-care costs","threshold value","threshold analysis","week project","family medical practice","potential savings","physicians\u0027 offices","participating medical practice","reduction","pertinent points of information","entire calendar year","family physician","health of Canadians","direct result","year period","percentage points","Influenza poses concerns","event of contacting influenza","uncertain piece of information","indications","promise","walk-in clinics","intervention\u0027s effectiveness","conservative estimates","environment","FP","significant positive influence","BACKGROUND","number of patients","paper","informational requirements","proportion of infected people","indirect approach","order","total","perspective of provincial government","main purpose","CONCLUSION","length","addition","METHODS","RESULTS","existing literature","Interventions","elements"],"language":"en"},

The EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999\u20132007). The following questions were addressed: 1) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity? 2) how long is a typical influenza season in Europe? 3) is there a west-east and/or south-north course of peak activity (\u0027spread\u0027) of influenza in Europe? METHODS: Influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners (GPs) and reports by national reference laboratories. The sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across Europe during eight seasons. RESULTS: We found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by sentinel physicians (overall match of 72% for \u002B/- 1 week difference). We also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources (overall match of 60% for \u002B/- 1 week). There were no statistically significant differences between countries using ILI (influenza-like illness) or ARI (acute respiratory disease) as case definition. When looking at the peak-weeks of clinical activity, the average length of an influenza season in Europe was 15.6 weeks (median 15 weeks; range 12\u201319 weeks). Plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel GPs against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west-east spread of peak activity (spread) of influenza across Europe in four winters (2001\u20132002, 2002\u20132003, 2003\u20132004 and 2004\u20132005) and a south-north spread in three winters (2001\u20132002, 2004\u20132005 and 2006\u20132007). CONCLUSION: We found that: 1) the clinical data reported by sentinel physicians is a valid indicator of influenza activity; 2) the length of influenza activity across the whole of Europe was surprisingly long, ranging from 12\u201319 weeks; 3) in 4 out of the 8 seasons, there was a west-east spread of influenza, in 3 seasons a south-north spread; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons.","publish_time":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paget, John; Marquet, Richard; Meijer, Adam; van der Velden, Koos","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfba5209f420bc33b292d253e5c6744090dde68b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2216029.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2216029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme","EISS"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["length of influenza activity","peak weeks of clinical influenza activity","laboratory reports of influenza","clinical activity","good measure of influenza activity","sentinel reports","west-east spread of influenza","sentinel clinical reports","valid indicator of influenza activity","clinical sentinel data","typical influenza season","clinical data","important epidemiological features of influenza activity","sentinel GPs","sentinel physicians","west-east spread of peak activity","European Influenza Surveillance Scheme","peak-weeks","north course of peak activity","south-north spread","seasons","non-sentinel sources","sentinel general practitioners","good match","virological data","overall match","winters","average length","EISS dataset","week difference","increasing number of countries","acute respiratory disease","ARI","illness","ILI","case definition","BACKGROUND","longitude","latitude","range","national reference laboratories","type of dominant virus","significant differences","country","RESULTS","METHODS","timing","following questions","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we analysed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes. RESULTS: H3N2 was the prevalent strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000\u20132001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002\u20132003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses the 2005\u20132006 season presented H1N1 of greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small \u0022jumps\u0022 in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002\u20132003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed. The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied during the study period and the H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequons in HA, the highest amount of glycosylations observed in this study period. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to our knowledge to characterise the evolution of complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a time period of seven years from 1999 to 2006. More precise knowledge about the circulating strains may have implications for predicting the following season strains and thereby better matching the vaccine composition.","publish_time":"2008-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bragstad, Karoline; Nielsen, Lars P; Fomsgaard, Anders","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94f84033171f0a095afc62fa7f44a597e6508a72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2311284.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2311284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Denmark","Europe"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 viruses","evolution of H3N2 viruses","H1N2 viruses","fit viruses","H1N2 influenza","H3N2 HA","influenza genes","human H3N2","study period","evolution of complete genomes of influenza","H3N2 isolates","complete genome sequences of influenza","Danish human influenza","complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza","time period","present study","longitudinal genome studies of human influenza","H1N1 of greater variability","circulating strains","following season strains","H1N2 isolates","Different lineages co-circulating","genetic distance","matrix protein","Europe","different countries","preferred site","non-structural protein","years of little genetic change","different seasons","prevalent strain","Denmark","present time","precise knowledge","migration of strains","glycosylations","polymerase acidic protein","antigenic site B","genes coding","seasonal phylogenetic clusters","neuraminidase","implications","gene reassortments","strong positive selection pressure","N-linked glycosylation pattern","CTL-epitopes","predicted sequons","jumps","constant drift","introduction","M1","monitoring","haemagglutinin","NS1","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","evolutionary stasis-periods","nucleoprotein","Substitutions","Fujian","CONCLUSION","vaccine composition","NP"],"language":"en"},

We observed highly increased CD13 mRNA and protein expression in the 1F6 clones regardless of the overexpression of either the 18kD or all isoform proteins. Neutral aminopeptidase activity was increased five-fold and could be inhibited by bestatin and the CD13-neutralising antibody WM15. The enhanced invasion through Matrigel, but not migration in a wound assay, was efficiently abrogated by both bestatin and WM15. Upregulation of CD13 expression was the result of increased epithelial and myeloid promoter activity up to 4.5-fold in 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones. Interestingly, in a panel of human melanoma cell lines, a significant correlation (r(2)=0.883, P\u003C0.05) between bFGF and CD13 mRNA and protein expression was detected. High bFGF and CD13 expression were clearly related with an aggressive phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that high bFGF expression upregulates CD13 expression in human melanoma cells by activating both the myeloid and the epithelial CD13 promoter.

Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD(50) (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD(50) per dose.

Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics, potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing, which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts. We used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact-tracing efficacy. For uncontrolled epidemics, outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks, with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low, but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates. For assortatively mixed networks, disease spreads first to highly connected nodes, but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes. The converse is true for disassortative mixing, where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes. For small epidemics, contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal. Multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single-step tracing for assortative mixing, but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks.","publish_time":"2007-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiss, Istvan Z; Green, Darren M; Kao, Rowland R","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f6a8fc2249ec3b9bc431c5eded7f6234c75c49d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2386895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact-tracing efficacy","disassortatively mixed networks","Multi-step contact tracing","disassortative networks","disassortative mixing","tracing rate low","single-step tracing","higher contact rates","connected nodes","isolate nodes","Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics","epidemic size","greater resilience of assortative networks","effects of mixing patterns","shorter epidemic duration","faster initial epidemic growth rate","disease spreads","uncontrolled epidemics","small epidemics","infectious contacts","numbers of contacts","lower infection rates","efficacy of control measures","outbreaks","converse","removal","stochastic simulations"],"language":"en"},

Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPV\u0394M2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate.

Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133(\u002B)) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133(\u2212)) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133(\u002B) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(\u002B), unlike LC-CD133(\u2212), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(\u002B) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(\u002B) to differentiate into LC-CD133(\u2212). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(\u002B) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(\u002B) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133(\u002B). Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133(\u002B) and malignant lung cancer.","publish_time":"2008-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yu-Chih; Hsu, Han-Shui; Chen, Yi-Wei; Tsai, Tung-Hu; How, Chorng-Kuang; Wang, Chien-Ying; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Chang, Yuh-Lih; Tsai, Ming-Long; Lee, Yi-Yen; Ku, Hung-Hai; Chiou, Shih-Hwa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cd96fd42139b22b63e5752eda2c38990a18763a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2440807.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440807/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LC-CD133","isolation of CD133","capability of LC","CD133-negative cells","LC cell lines","chemoradioresistant properties of LC","lung cancer cells","malignant lung cancer","positive cells","non-small cell lung cancer","subset population of cancer stem","siRNA","regulated expression","treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy","self-renewing","important marker","multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2","patients","colony formation","significant resistance","chemotherapy agents","proliferative potential","apoptotic activities of caspase","ADP-ribose","doxorubicin","etoposide","polymerase","cisplatin","abilities of tumor invasion","tissue samples","crucial role","reservoir","paclitaxel","PARP","expressions","lentiviral vector","studies","spheres","transmembrane glycoprotein","Future research","prominin","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents. CONCLUSION: CCC staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision-making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks.

Secondly, the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames. We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework, enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment. RESULTS: We run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment. We show that the standard practice of using a ClustalW alignment can lead to considerable biases and that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments. We even manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with an alignment produced by GenAl. We subsequently run our method on HIV2 and Hepatitis B sequences. CONCLUSION: We propose that marginalizing over all alignments, as opposed to using a fixed one, should be considered in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which the alignments are not known with certainty. Moreover, we discover in HIV2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent selection than single coding ones. Additionally, there appears to be evidence for differential selection, where one overlapping reading frame is under positive and the other under negative selection.","publish_time":"2008-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Groot, Saskia; Mailund, Thomas; Lunter, Gerton; Hein, Jotun","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68f756a2b4d54f85dc7affd1643d8225653e1918.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2478691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2478691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selection estimation","study of selection","stringent selection","differential selection","negative selection","fixed alignment","ClustalW alignment","overlapping reading frames","un-biased selection parameters","reliable alignment of genomes","statistical alignment framework","inferred alignments","uncertainty of individual alignments","HIV2","model","estimation accuracy","double coding regions","high mutation rates","estimates of neutral mutation rates","parametric inference","viral genomes","different genomic regions","single coding ones","divergent sequence data","considerable biases","presence of genes","method","Hepatitis B sequences","way","comparison","general evolutionary distances","standard practice","problems","use","series of simulation studies","BACKGROUND","marginalizing","GenAl","evidence","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","issues"],"language":"en"},

However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of \u223C16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR\u003C0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible \u201Cselection histories\u201D of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.","publish_time":"2008-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kosiol, Carolin; Vina\u0159, Tom\u00E1\u0161; da Fonseca, Rute R.; Hubisz, Melissa J.; Bustamante, Carlos D.; Nielsen, Rasmus; Siepel, Adam","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01c6c44650ad5466cdb134a28d0b14700fa3906d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c86eba5cb05531b033922afbe3f9148d1cd3c5dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2483296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2483296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Affymetrix"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified PSGs","non-PSGs","widespread positive selection","significant evidence of positive selection","selected genes","human genes","brain-specific genes","selection histories","functional implications of positive selection","functions of individual genes","comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs","additional evidence","possible co-evolution of interacting genes","specific functions","dynamics of genome evolution","Genome-wide scans","mammalian evolution","new genome-wide insights","high-coverage genome assemblies","species","tissue-specific manner","clade-specific tests","previous scans","new lineage","statistical power","eutherian mammals","chemosensory perception","mediated immunity","taste perception","previous studies","high-confidence orthologs","novel Bayesian analysis","small numbers of available genomes","detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data","dataset results","nonselection","genetic basis of differences","reproduction","roles","defense","date","particular lineages","multiple times","increased phylogenetic depth","accuracy","enrichments","clades","study","FDR","testes","liver","standard likelihood ratio test","breast","lower levels","spleen","pathways"],"language":"en"},

The current study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms involved in summoning macrophages to the cochlear lateral wall and the role macrophages play in noise-induced injury or repair. CCL2 and its primary receptor, CCR2, are the most widely validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis in vivo. CCL2(\u2212/\u2212) and CCR2(\u2212/\u2212) mice have been used extensively in studies of monocyte activation in neuronal injury. However, the function of CCL2 and CCR2 in the cochlea has not been studied. The present study examines the role of CCL2 and CCR2 in acoustic injury. CCL2(\u2212/\u2212) and CCR2(\u2212/\u2212) mice on a CX3CR1(\u002B/GFP) background were exposed to octave band noise (8\u201316 kHz) for 2 h to determine the effect of CCL2 and CCR2 on monocyte migration into the cochlea, threshold shift, and cell survival. We found that threshold shift was unchanged in the two knockout mouse strains when compared to the background strain (CX3CR1(\u002B/GFP)). Surprisingly, we found that monocyte migration was also unchanged, despite the absence of CCL2 or CCR2. However, there was a dramatic increase in noise-induced hair cell death in the CCR2(\u2212/\u2212) strain. This observation suggests that CCR2, independent of CCL2, plays a protective role in the cochlea after noise, and neither ligand nor receptor is necessary for monocyte migration. Possible mechanisms of neuroprotection by CCR2 are discussed.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sautter, Nathan B.; Shick, Elizabeth H.; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Charo, Israel F.; Hirose, Keiko","journal":"Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c929ca540bf82c726f7d2875cb3a9dadacbf663.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2504633.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10162-006-0051-x.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCR2","role of CCL2","independent of CCL2","effect of CCL2","absence of CCL2","function of CCL2","monocyte migration","role macrophages","noise-induced injury","acoustic injury","studies of monocyte activation","summoning macrophages","noise-induced hair cell death","protective role","octave band noise","threshold shift","neuronal injury","validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis","background strain","CX3CR1","GFP","mice","rapid entry of macrophages","cell survival","primary receptor","present study","current study","Acoustic trauma","Possible mechanisms of neuroprotection","cochlear lateral wall","ligand","dramatic increase","knockout mouse strains","spiral ligament","kHz","repair","inflammatory response","observation"],"language":"en"},

We examined whether HIV-specific T-cells are identified in the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses. METHODS: Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4(\u002B) T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B) T-cells producing IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-\u03B1. In both mono- and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific T-cells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4(\u002B) T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: The accumulation of functional HIV-specific T-cells in the liver during HCV/HIV co-infection may represent a bystander role for HIV in inducing faster progression of liver disease.","publish_time":"2008-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vali, Bahareh; Yue, Feng Yun; Jones, R.

The exact prevalence is unknown but it is estimated that mesotheliomas represent less than 1% of all cancers. Its incidence is increasing, with an expected peak in the next 10\u201320 years. Pleural malignant mesothelioma is the most common form of mesothelioma. Typical presenting features are those of chest pain and dyspnoea. Breathlessness due to a pleural effusion without chest pain is reported in about 30% of patients. A chest wall mass, weight loss, sweating, abdominal pain and ascites (due to peritoneal involvement) are less common presentations. Mesothelioma is directly attributable to occupational asbestos exposure with a history of exposure in over 90% of cases. There is also evidence that mesothelioma may result from both para-occupational exposure and non-occupational \u0022environmental\u0022 exposure. Idiopathic or spontaneous mesothelioma can also occur in the absence of any exposure to asbestos, with a spontaneous rate in humans of around one per million. A combination of accurate exposure history, along with examination radiology and pathology are essential to make the diagnosis. Distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease can be challenging. The most helpful CT findings suggesting malignant pleural disease are 1) a circumferential pleural rind, 2) nodular pleural thickening, 3) pleural thickening of \u003E 1 cm and 4) mediastinal pleural involvement. Involvement of a multidisciplinary team is recommended to ensure prompt and appropriate management, using a framework of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and symptom palliation with end of life care. Compensation issues must also be considered.

Viet Nam\u0027s extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We report here the health workers\u0027 perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted. Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes. RESULTS: Factors that lead to health workers\u0027 failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines. A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours. Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care. CONCLUSION: Many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation. Reduction of workload would also be important. Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.","publish_time":"2009-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Thu Anh; Oosterhoff, Pauline; Pham, Yen Ngoc; Hardon, Anita; Wright, Pamela","journal":"Hum Resour Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ffdabbd3e504f20d074aa3c41a09aa85b855998.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2684067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Viet Nam"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hanoi"],"keyphrases":["health facilities","skills of health workers","inadequate health care services","capable health workers","good care","child transmission services","health workers\u0027 failure","good quality prevention of mother","quality of prevention","health workers\u0027 perceptions","child transmission policies","HIV-infected patients","provision of care","appropriate care","continuum of care","Viet Nam\u0027s extensive health care system","HIV-infected mothers","implementation of prevention","fear of HIV infection","unavailability of HIV testing","good quality services","HIV-positive pregnant women","lack of staff","lack of knowledge","counselling skills","referral system","factors","development","lack of operational guidelines","commune level","village level","vertical programme","result of fear","hospital staff","needs of patients","specialized vertical pillars","shortage of antiretroviral drugs","children","comprehensive set of interventions","high workloads","study","unstructured observations","prevailing association","AIDS","Semistructured interviews","experience","major obstacle","separate area","communication","simple intervention","antisocial behaviours","negative attitude","greater support","function","position","avoidance","METHODS","Hanoi","programmes","distrust","fragmentation","Reduction of workload","motivation","practical strategy","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Selection of respondents"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted \u03B1(1)-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of \u03B1(1)-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific \u03B1(1)-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different \u03B1(1)-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor.

In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling. METHODS: Road distance and travel time are calculated from the postal code of residence of each patient undergoing cardiac catheterization to the pertinent hospital. The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively. Distance estimates and distance measurements are then compared using descriptive statistics and visual mapping methods. The optimized Minkowski metric is implemented, via the spatial weight matrix, in a spatial regression model identifying socio-economic factors significantly associated with cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: The Minkowski coefficient that best approximates road distance is 1.54; 1.31 best approximates travel time. The latter is also a good predictor of road distance, thus providing the best single model of travel from patient\u0027s residence to hospital. The Euclidean metric and the optimal Minkowski metric are alternatively implemented in the regression model, and the results compared. The Minkowski method produces more reliable results than the traditional Euclidean metric. CONCLUSION: Road distance and travel time measurements are the most accurate estimates, but cannot be directly implemented in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance tends to underestimate road distance and travel time; Manhattan distance tends to overestimate both. The optimized Minkowski distance partially overcomes their shortcomings; it provides a single model of travel over the network. The method is flexible, suitable for analytical modeling, and more accurate than the traditional metrics; its use ultimately increases the reliability of spatial analytical models.","publish_time":"2009-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahid, Rizwan; Bertazzon, Stefania; Knudtson, Merril L; Ghali, William A","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4961ab3b26b0165a3f1b267fc776329d792fc5f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2781002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Minkowski"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Manhattan"],"keyphrases":["distance measurements","Euclidean distance","Distance estimates","optimized Minkowski distance","Manhattan distance","known Minkowski distance metrics","good predictor of road distance","optimized Minkowski metric","travel time measurements","optimal Minkowski metric","Minkowski method","approximate travel time","best single model of travel","traditional Euclidean metric","spatial analytical modeling","Minkowski coefficient","appropriate metric","spatial regression model","actual measurements","reliability of spatial analytical models","accurate estimates","traditional metrics","spatial weight matrix","patient residence","cardiac catheterization services","patient\u0027s residence","reliable results","pertinent hospital","promising method","distances","postal code of residence","given network","visual mapping methods","socio-economic factors","descriptive statistics","shortcomings","use","CONCLUSION","study","health service research","methodological approaches","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5\u2032 direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 \u00B1 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.","publish_time":"2009-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazauric, Marie-H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Seol, Yeonee; Yoshizawa, Satoko; Visscher, Koen; Fourmy, Dominique","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d81eea0f16b71d643336838cd22e51125bf05ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2794165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2794165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzczMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ribosomal"],"organizations":["S P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unstable lower stem","mRNA stem-loop","GC-rich upper stem","long hairpin","nucleotide bulge","Mechanical stretching","efficient frameshifting","Ribosomal frameshifting","translocating ribosome","single step of translocation","clear identification of unfolding","mechanical properties of structural elements","downstream secondary structure resists","multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles","deacylated tRNA","movement","optical tweezers","S P site","HIV","notion","viral RNAs","domains","type B","pseudoknots","chemical probing assays","slippery sequence","human immunodeficiency virus","Toeprinting","force","direction","presence","ribosomes","loops","pN","translation"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver dysfunction, coagulopathy and neurologic involvement. The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period. Cases of relapse of macrophage activating syndrome are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl with Still\u0027s disease who developed macrophage activating syndrome with acute respiratory distress syndrome that required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Following intensive treatment, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine, the patient improved significantly. Two weeks after cyclosporine was discontinued, however, she was readmitted with an acute relapse of macrophage activating syndrome manifested by spiking fever, arthralgias, maculopapular rash and leukocytosis.

With a view to elucidate the function of nonstructural protein, NSs encoded by the small RNA genome (S RNA), the NSs protein of GBNV- tomato (Karnataka) [1] was over-expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified rNSs protein exhibited an RNA stimulated NTPase activity. Further, this activity was metal ion dependent and was inhibited by adenosine 5\u2032 (\u03B2, \u03B3 imido) triphosphate, an ATP analog. The rNSs could also hydrolyze dATP. Interestingly, in addition to the NTPase and dATPase activities, the rNSs exhibited ATP independent 5\u2032 RNA/DNA phosphatase activity that was completely inhibited by AMP. The 5\u2032 \u03B1 phosphate could be removed from ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA and dsRNA thus confirming that rNSs has a novel 5\u2032 \u03B1 phosphatase activity. K189A mutation in the Walker motif A (GxxxxGKT) resulted in complete loss of ATPase activity, but the 5\u2032 phosphatase activity was unaffected. On the other hand, D159A mutation in the Walker motif B (DExx) resulted in partial loss of both the activities. These results demonstrate for the first time that NSs is a bifunctional enzyme, which could participate in viral movement, replication or in suppression of the host defense mechanism.","publish_time":"2010-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lokesh, Bhushan; Rashmi, Panigrahi R.; Amruta, Bhat S.; Srisathiyanarayanan, Dharmaiah; Murthy, Mathur R.

Though, when host physiology is disrupted, this commensal-host interaction can degenerate and lead to an opportunistic infection. Relatively little is known regarding the dynamics of C. albicans colonization and pathogenesis. We developed a C. albicans cell surface protein microarray to profile the immunoglobulin G response during commensal colonization and candidemia. The antibody response from the sera of patients with candidemia and our negative control groups indicate that the immunocompetent host exists in permanent host-pathogen interplay with commensal C. albicans. This report also identifies cell surface antigens that are specific to different phases (i.e. acute, early and mid convalescence) of candidemia. We identified a set of thirteen cell surface antigens capable of distinguishing acute candidemia from healthy individuals and uninfected hospital patients with commensal colonization. Interestingly, a large proportion of these cell surface antigens are involved in either oxidative stress or drug resistance. In addition, we identified 33 antigenic proteins that are enriched in convalescent sera of the candidemia patients. Intriguingly, we found within this subset an increase in antigens associated with heme-associated iron acquisition. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms of C. albicans colonization as well as the development of systemic infection.","publish_time":"2010-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mochon, A.

Current efforts are focusing on developing therapeutic agents capable of specifically targeting cancer cells and tumor-associated microenvironments including tumor blood vessels. These therapies hold the promise of high efficacy and low toxicity. One recognized strategy for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutics is to encapsulate anticancer drugs into targeting liposomes that bind to the cell surface receptors expressed on tumor-associated endothelial cells. These anti-angiogenic drug delivery systems could be used to target both tumor blood vessels as well as the tumor cells, themselves.

During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, \u03B2-defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5\u20137 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alpha\u20131-antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity. Our results provide evidence for a first wave of host anti-viral defense occurring in the eclipse phase of AHI prior to systemic activation of other immune responses. Insights gained into the mechanism of action of acute-phase reactants and other innate molecules against HIV and how they are induced could be exploited for the future development of more efficient prophylactic vaccine strategies.","publish_time":"2010-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kramer, Holger B.; Lavender, Kerry J.; Qin, Li; Stacey, Andrea R.; Liu, Michael K.

We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.","publish_time":"2010-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, Heath A.; Mercer, Geoff N.; Fielding, James E.; Dowse, Gary K.; Glass, Kathryn; Carcione, Dale; Grant, Kristina A.; Effler, Paul V.; Lester, Rosemary A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2893203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2893203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Western Australia"],"locations":["Victoria","Australia","WA","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["WA","State of Victoria","community transmission of pandemic influenza","pandemic curve","Epidemic transmission","parts of Australia","commencement of transmission","Western Australia","time testing","novel virus","Victorian epidemic","Victorian cases","highest notification rate of pandemic","observed data","imported cases","modelling","contrast","plausible model input data","Australian states","earlier date","estimation","confirmed infection","detailed case follow-up of patients","effective reproductive number","H1N1","Bayesian inference accounting","opposite sides","Strong circumstantial evidence","susceptible-infected","difference","CONCLUSION","continent","importation","METHODS","world","RESULTS","brothers","family","BACKGROUND","Mexico"],"language":"en"},

However, PEMFs are known to affect the expression of certain genes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked (1) whether PEMFs affect gene expression in human osteoblastlike cells (MG63) in vitro, and (2) whether and to what extent stimulation by PEMFs induce cell proliferation and differentiation in MG-63 cultures. METHODS: We cultured two groups of MG63 cells. One group was treated with PEMFs for 18 hours whereas the second was maintained in the same culture condition without PEMFs (control). Gene expression was evaluated throughout cDNA microarray analysis containing 19,000 genes spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome. RESULTS: PEMFs induced the upregulation of important genes related to bone formation (HOXA10, AKT1), genes at the transductional level (CALM1, P2RX7), genes for cytoskeletal components (FN1, VCL), and collagenous (COL1A2) and noncollagenous (SPARC) matrix components. However, PEMF induced downregulation of genes related to the degradation of extracellular matrix (MMP-11, DUSP4). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PEMFs appear to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, PEMFs promote extracellular matrix production and mineralization while decreasing matrix degradation and absorption. Our data suggest specific mechanisms of the observed clinical effect of PEMFs, and thus specific approaches for use in regenerative medicine.","publish_time":"2010-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sollazzo, Vincenzo; Palmieri, Annalisa; Pezzetti, Furio; Massari, Leo; Carinci, Francesco","journal":"Clin Orthop Relat Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/834fbf0a08acd3107e6a560519d8ce9e3479f2c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2895828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEMF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["observed clinical effect of PEMFs","expression of certain genes","matrix degradation","matrix components","upregulation of important genes","degradation of extracellular matrix","gene expression","PEMF induced downregulation of genes","extracellular matrix production","specific mechanisms","cell proliferation","differentiation","human osteoblastlike cells","groups of MG63 cells","specific approaches","mechanisms of action","cytoskeletal components","human genome","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","mineralization","P2RX7","bone formation","VCL","AKT1","FN1","cDNA microarray analysis","CALM1","HOXA10","transductional level","substantial fraction","COL1A2","nonunions","use","regenerative medicine","pulsed electromagnetic fields","SPARC","MMP","extent stimulation","delayed unions","BACKGROUND","data","culture condition","control","absorption","CONCLUSIONS","DUSP4","RESULTS","QUESTIONS","PURPOSES","METHODS","cultures","hours"],"language":"en"},

Proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. Here we specifically aimed to differentiate between the PP and RR subtypes of MScl by comparing CSF proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CSF samples (n = 31) were handled according to the same protocol for quantitative mass spectrometry measurements we reported previously. In the comparison of PP MScl versus RR MScl we observed a number of differentially abundant proteins, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin D-binding protein. Protein jagged-1 was over three times less abundant in PP MScl compared to RR MScl. Vitamin D-binding protein was only detected in the RR MScl samples. These two proteins were validated by independent techniques (western blot and ELISA) as differentially abundant in the comparison between both MScl types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The main finding of this comparative study is the observation that the proteome profiles of CSF in PP and RR MScl patients overlap to a large extent. Still, a number of differences could be observed. Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling. It is suggested in literature that the Notch pathway is involved in the remyelination of MScl lesions. Aberration of normal homeostasis of Vitamin D, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein, has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now. Vitamin D directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4\u002B T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, and so it may be involved in neuroprotective elements in MScl.","publish_time":"2010-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stoop, Marcel P.; Singh, Vaibhav; Dekker, Lennard J.; Titulaer, Mark K.; Stingl, Christoph; Burgers, Peter C.; Sillevis Smitt, Peter A.

Uncertainty still exists, partly because of the limited number of cases analysed. In this study, a full autopsy including 5 organ systems was conducted on a confirmed H5N1 human fatal case (male, 42 years old) within 18 hours of death. In addition to the respiratory system (lungs, bronchus and trachea), virus was isolated from cerebral cortex, cerebral medullary substance, cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus ileum, colon, rectum, ureter, aortopulmonary vessel and lymph-node. Real time RT-PCR evidence showed that matrix and hemagglutinin genes were positive in liver and spleen in addition to positive tissues with virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization stains showed accordant evidence of viral infection with real time RT-PCR except bronchus. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that a high viral load was associated with increased host responses, though the viral load was significantly different in various organs. Cells of the immunologic system could also be a target for virus infection. Overall, the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus was associated both with virus replication and with immunopathologic lesions. In addition, immune cells cannot be excluded from playing a role in dissemination of the virus in vivo.","publish_time":"2010-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Rongbao; Dong, Libo; Dong, Jie; Wen, Leying; Zhang, Ye; Yu, Hongjie; Feng, Zijian; Chen, Minmei; Tan, Yi; Mo, Zhaojun; Liu, Haiyan; Fan, Yunyan; Li, Kunxiong; Li, Chris Ka-Fai; Li, Dexin; Yang, Weizhong; Shu, Yuelong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28e355b80d2d62c5314e8d97e92fbd67f77679d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2953511.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","virus replication","virus isolation","viral replication","pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus","addition","pathogenic avian influenza virus","Real time RT-PCR evidence","high viral load","Quantitative RT-PCR","accordant evidence of viral infection","lungs","bronchus","multiple human organs","confirmed H5N1 human fatal case","cerebral cortex","positive tissues","organ systems","respiratory system","immunologic system","various organs","Autopsy studies","immune cells","cerebral medullary substance","possible causes of organ damage","cerebellum","brain stem","colon","male","hippocampus ileum","ureter","rectum","situ hybridization stains","hemagglutinin genes","spleen","liver","matrix","aortopulmonary vessel","increased host responses","years old","target","trachea","lymph-node","dysregulation of cytokines","Immunohistochemistry","immunopathologic lesions","hours of death","limited number of cases","chemokines","role","dissemination","study","Uncertainty"],"language":"en"},

FINDINGS: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R(0 )was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19).

We call this the L11 \u2018P-site loop\u2019. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth. These analyses suggest that the L11 P-site loop normally helps to optimize ribosome function by monitoring the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.","publish_time":"2010-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rhodin, Michael H.

The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.","publish_time":"2010-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez-Lopez, Denise G.; Fahey, Mark; Coburn, Jenifer","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d8ab6d3f0c6ff09e306c23c87f823f9382ff32e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3001904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endothelial cells","endothelial cell lines","disruption of endothelial layer integrity","endothelial protective activities","widespread endothelial damage","interrogans","significant disruption of endothelial cell layers","endothelial barrier function","cell layer integrity","endothelial protective drug lisinopril","changes","severity of leptospirosis","non-pathogenic leptospires","agents of leptospirosis","addition","widespread zoonotic infection","biflexa","severe disease manifestations","temperate regions","residents of tropical regions","multi-organ failure","derivatives","non-specific illness","infections","apoptosis","products","animals","expression of genes","microscopy","responses","cellular architecture","antibiotic therapy","relevant concentrations","humans","matrix","necrosis","members","hemorrhage","dissemination","adhesion of","genus Leptospira","opposite directions","bacterial strain","interactions","Microarray analyses","prolonged incubation","saprophytic species","ability","results"],"language":"en"},

Hence the extent of likely excess healthcare needs during this period must be fully considered. We will make use of the historical healthcare record in Taiwan during and after the 1918 influenza pandemic to ascertain the scope of potential excess healthcare burden during the post-pandemic period. METHODS: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918-1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent \u0022baseline\u0022 years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the excess healthcare burden during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after. RESULTS: In 1918 the number of public hospital outpatients exceeded the yearly average of the baseline years by 20.11% (95% CI: 16.43, 25.90), and the number of hospitalizations exceeded the corresponding yearly average of the baseline years by 12.20% (10.59, 14.38), while the excess number of patients treated by the public medics was statistically significant at 32.21% (28.48, 39.82) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. For 1920, only the excess number of hospitalizations was statistically significant at 19.83% (95% CI: 17.21, 23.38) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable extra burden with significant loss of lives was reported in 1918 by both the public medics system and the public hospitals. In comparison, only a substantial number of excess hospitalizations in the public hospitals was reported in 1920, indicating that the population was relatively unprepared for the first wave in 1918 and did not fully utilize the public hospitals. Moreover, comparatively low mortality was reported by the public hospitals and the public medics during the second wave in 1920 even though significantly more patients were hospitalized, suggesting that there had been substantially less fatal illnesses among the hospitalized patients during the second wave. Our results provide viable parameters for assessing healthcare needs for post-pandemic preparedness.","publish_time":"2011-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Chan, Chi-Ho","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba5705abe2333b10925a5b8a45bc8d8b06f8ec50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3031222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3031222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public hospitals","baseline years","excess number of hospitalizations","excess number of patients","yearly healthcare records","influenza pandemic","number of public hospital outpatients","substantial number of excess hospitalizations","public medics system","corresponding yearly average","scope of potential excess healthcare burden","extent of likely excess healthcare needs","post-pandemic preparedness","current post-pandemic period","historical healthcare record","initial wave","pandemic H1N1 influenza virus","hospitalized patients","Taiwan","RESULTS","CI","Considerable extra burden","significant loss of lives","initial outbreak","corresponding data","severe clinical presentation","seasonal pattern","high-risk groups","viable parameters","CONCLUSIONS","fatal illnesses","use","low mortality","comparison","METHODS","population","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

HAAA occurs most frequently in young male children and is lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be attributed to various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV have been associated with this set of symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. Considerable evidences including the clinical features, severe imbalance of the T cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy strongly present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has been found with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis phenomenon as causative agents of the disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed for the development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the features of HAAA have been mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New therapeutic approaches involve the administration of steroids especially the glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response. Pancytopenia following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell transplantation than immunosuppressive therapy.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rauff, Bisma; Idrees, Muhammad; Shah, Shahida Amjad Riaz; Butt, Sadia; Butt, Azeem M; Ali, Liaqat; Hussain, Abrar; Irshad-ur-Rehman; Ali, Muhammad","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e82d495f9c8238f815a1586adbad8380d9ec38c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3052191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein"],"organizations":["HAV","HAAA","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatitis viruses","various hepatitis","E hepatitis virus","acute attack of hepatitis","episode of acute hepatitis response","immunosuppressive therapy response","features of HAAA","unknown viruses","present HAAA","association of HAAA","hematopoietic cell transplantation","development of aplastic anemia","immune functioning","T cell immune system","effective response","clinical features","distinct variant of aplastic anemia","pancytopenia","syndrome","Epstein bar virus","Transfusion Transmitted virus","immune mediated mechanism","blood profiling","bone marrow hypocellularity examination","clinical manifestations","blood transfusions","viral serological markers testing","causative agents","Cytomegalovirus","severe imbalance","parvovirus B19","disorder","TTV","HLA matched donor","HBV","immunopathogenesis phenomenon","telomerase mutation","HCV","HDV","HAV","glucocorticoids","administration of steroids","HGV","HEV","young male children","Diagnosis","months","New therapeutic approaches","genetic factor","Considerable evidences","drugs","toxins","Patients","set of symptoms","etiology"],"language":"en"},

As is evidenced by most zoonotic influenza virus infections, not all strains that can infect humans are able to transmit from person-to-person. Animal models of influenza are essential to research efforts aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to the disease and transmission outcomes of influenza virus infection in humans. These models furthermore allow the pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in the population through amelioration of the virulence or transmissibility of influenza viruses.

Furthermore, the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. We characterized a lineage of BGwith a long history of use as a simulant for BW operations, focusing on classical bacteriological markers, metabolic profiling and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Archival strains and two \u201Cpresent day\u201D type strains were compared to simulant strains on different laboratory media. Several of the samples produced multiple colony morphotypes that differed from that of an archival isolate. To trace the microevolutionary history of these isolates, we obtained WGS data for several archival and present-day strains and morphotypes. Bacillus-wide phylogenetic analysis identified B. subtilis as the nearest neighbor to B. atrophaeus. The genome of B. atrophaeus is, on average, 86% identical to B. subtilis on the nucleotide level. WGS of variants revealed that several strains were mixed but highly related populations and uncovered a progressive accumulation of mutations among the \u201Cmilitary\u201D isolates. Metabolic profiling and microscopic examination of bacterial cultures revealed enhanced growth of \u201Cmilitary\u201D isolates on lactate-containing media, and showed that the \u201Cmilitary\u201D strains exhibited a hypersporulating phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed the genomic and phenotypic signatures of strain adaptation and deliberate selection for traits that were desirable in a simulant organism. Together, these results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages to develop and validate forensic markers for strain discrimination and reveal signatures of deliberate adaptation.","publish_time":"2011-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibbons, Henry S.; Broomall, Stacey M.; McNew, Lauren A.; Daligault, Hajnalka; Chapman, Carol; Bruce, David; Karavis, Mark; Krepps, Michael; McGregor, Paul A.; Hong, Charles; Park, Kyong H.; Akmal, Arya; Feldman, Andrew; Lin, Jeffrey S.; Chang, Wenling E.; Higgs, Brandon W.; Demirev, Plamen; Lindquist, John; Liem, Alvin; Fochler, Ed; Read, Timothy D.; Tapia, Roxanne; Johnson, Shannon; Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.; Detter, Chris; Han, Cliff; Sozhamannan, Shanmuga; Rosenzweig, C.

The recurrence of malaria in primigravidae women irrespective of acquired protection during childhood is caused by the interaction between the parasite-expressed VAR2CSA antigen and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space and lack of protective antibodies. PM impairs fetal development mainly by excessive inflammation processes. After infections during pregnancy women acquire immunity to PM conferred by antibodies against VAR2CSA. Ideally, a vaccine against PM will induce antibody-mediated immune responses that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have previously shown that antibodies raised in rat against individual domains of VAR2CSA can block IE binding to CSA. In this study we have immunized mice, rats and rabbits with each individual domain and the full-length protein corresponding to the FCR3 VAR2CSA variant. We found there is an inherently higher immunogenicity of C-terminal domains compared to N-terminally located domains. This was irrespective of whether antibodies were induced against single domains or the full-length protein. Species-specific antibody responses were also found, these were mainly directed against single domains and not the full-length VAR2CSA protein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Binding inhibitory antibodies appeared to be against conformational B-cell epitopes. Non-binding inhibitory antibodies reacted highly against the C-terminal end of the VAR2CSA molecule especially the highly polymorphic DBL6\u03B5 domain. Differential species-specific induction of antibody responses may allow for more direct analysis of functional versus non-functional B-cell epitopes.","publish_time":"2011-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinto, Vera V.; Ditlev, Sisse B.; Jensen, Kamilla E.; Resende, Mafalda; Dahlb\u00E4ck, Madeleine; Andersen, Gorm; Andersen, Pernille; Theander, Thor G.; Salanti, Ali; Nielsen, Morten A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d4ce1e58828bc78c7c83f40c14765df96feb277.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3064590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3064590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IE","CSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual domains of VAR2CSA","full-length VAR2CSA protein","VAR2CSA molecule","VAR2CSA antigen","terminal domains","single domains","full-length protein","Non-binding inhibitory antibodies","FCR3 VAR2CSA variant","lack of protective antibodies","Species-specific antibody responses","recurrence of malaria","Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemic areas placental malaria","important complication of malaria","immune responses","Differential species-specific induction of antibody responses","non-functional B-cell epitopes","conformational B-cell epitopes","C-terminal end","primigravidae women","pregnancy women","placental intervillous space","higher immunogenicity of C","polymorphic DBL6\u03B5 domain","rats","direct analysis of functional","fetal development","rabbits","immunity","chondroitin sulfate","excessive inflammation processes","immunized mice","BACKGROUND","parasite","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","adhesion of infected erythrocytes","study","childhood","protection","infections","interaction","vaccine","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

A sample of 227 mostly primiparous women in the third trimester of pregnancy was surveyed in a large tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Post-delivery data were collected from medical records. In bivariate analysis, both optimism and pessimism were related to unplanned c-section. However, when optimism and pessimism were entered into a regression model together, optimism was no longer statistically significant. Pessimism remained significant, even when adjusting for clinical factors such as previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, infant gestational age, infant birthweight, labor duration, birth complications, and self-rated difficulty of the pregnancy.

The majority of pregnancy-related critical care admissions occur postpartum. Antenatally, the pregnant patient is more likely to be admitted with diseases non-specific to pregnancy, such as pneumonia. Pregnancy-specific diseases resulting in ICU admission include obstetric hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, amniotic fluid embolus syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Alternatively, critical illness may result from pregnancy-induced worsening of pre-existing diseases (for example, valvular heart disease, myasthenia gravis, and kidney disease). Pregnancy can also predispose women to diseases seen in the non-pregnant population, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (for example, pneumonia and aspiration), sepsis (for example, chorioamnionitis and pyelonephritis) or pulmonary embolism. The pregnant patient may also develop conditions co-incidental to pregnancy such as trauma or appendicitis. Hemorrhage, particularly postpartum, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain the most frequent indications for ICU admission. This review focuses on pregnancy-specific causes of critical illness. Management of the critically ill mother poses special challenges. The physiologic changes in pregnancy and the presence of a second, dependent, patient may necessitate adjustments to therapeutic and supportive strategies. The fetus is generally robust despite maternal illness, and therapeutically what is good for the mother is generally good for the fetus. For pregnancy-induced critical illnesses, delivery of the fetus helps resolve the disease process. Prognosis following pregnancy-related critical illness is generally better than for age-matched non-pregnant critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2011-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neligan, Patrick J; Laffey, John G","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65606747ac986dfd110b35de1ebfbe625b620d55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3387584.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["majority of pregnancy","pregnancy-related critical illness","Pregnancy-specific diseases","pregnancy-specific causes of critical illness","hypertensive disorders of pregnancy","devastating complication of pregnancy","acute fatty liver of pregnancy","pregnancy-induced worsening of pre-existing diseases","critical illnesses","pregnant patient","example","maternal illness","fetus","diseases non-specific","related critical care admissions","non-pregnant population","ICU admission","age-matched non-pregnant","ill mother","kidney disease","pneumonia","disease process","acute respiratory distress syndrome","valvular heart disease","amniotic fluid embolus syndrome","pre-eclampsia","obstetric hemorrhage","ill patients","elevated liver enzymes","low platelet count","HELLP","myasthenia gravis","hemolysis","conditions co-incidental","adjustments","chorioamnionitis","frequent indications","pyelonephritis","sepsis","presence","trauma","aspiration","delivery","Prognosis","peripartum cardiomyopathy","supportive strategies","pulmonary embolism","special challenges","physiologic changes","review","women","Management","appendicitis","Antenatally"],"language":"en"},

IgY antibodies avoid those limitations; therefore they could be an alternative to be applied in T. gondii model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we immunized hens with soluble tachyzoite antigens of T. gondii (STAg) and purified egg yolk antibodies (IgY) by an inexpensive and simple method, with high yield and purity degree. IgY anti-STAg antibodies presented high avidity and were able to recognize a broad range of parasite antigens, although some marked differences were observed in reactivity profile between antibodies produced in immunized hens and mice. Interestingly, IgY antibodies against Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp. did not react to STAg.

Herein we used [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) as a radiotracer for PET imaging coupled with CT (FDG-PET/CT) to gain insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammatory response of ferrets infected with a clinical isolate of a pandemic influenza virus, H1N1 (H1N1pdm). The thoracic regions of mock- and H1N1pdm-infected ferrets were imaged prior to infection and at 1, 2, 3 and 6 days post-infection (DPI). On 1 DPI, FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed areas of consolidation in the right caudal lobe which corresponded with elevated [(18)F]-FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax), 4.7\u20137.0). By days 2 and 3, consolidation (CT) and inflammation ([(18)F]-FDG) appeared in the left caudal lobe. By 6 DPI, CT images showed extensive areas of patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations with the largest lesions having high SUVMax (6.0\u20137.6). Viral shedding and replication were detected in most nasal, throat and rectal swabs and nasal turbinates and lungs on 1, 2 and 3 DPI, but not on day 7, respectively. In conclusion, molecular imaging of infected ferrets revealed a progressive consolidation on CT with corresponding [(18)F]-FDG uptake. Strong positive correlations were measured between SUVMax and bronchiolitis-related pathologic scoring (Spearman\u2019s \u03C1 = 0.75). Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen on CT in the ferret model at 6 DPI are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections. In summary, these first molecular imaging studies of lower respiratory infection with H1N1pdm show that FDG-PET can give insight into the spatiotemporal progression of the inflammation in real-time.","publish_time":"2012-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonsson, Colleen B.; Camp, Jeremy V.; Wu, Albert; Zheng, Huaiyu; Kraenzle, Jennifer L.; Biller, Ashley E.; Vanover, Carol D.; Chu, Yong-Kyu; Ng, Chin K.; Proctor, Mary; Sherwood, Leslie; Steffen, Marlene C.; Mollura, Daniel J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d2c6b24e096eac147115b77f295e0ddcb5435c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3401186.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3401186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CT imaging","FDG-PET","FDG uptake","PET imaging","CT images","areas of consolidation","molecular imaging of infected ferrets","H1N1pdm-infected ferrets","progression of inflammation","progressive consolidation","spatiotemporal progression","molecular imaging studies of lower respiratory infection","extensive areas of patchy GGO","high SUVMax","human H1N1pdm infections","insight","days post-infection","extensive areas of patchy ground-glass opacities","inflammatory response of ferrets","right caudal lobe","left caudal lobe","maximum standardized uptake values","nasal turbinates","consolidations","bronchiolitis-related pathologic scoring","pandemic influenza virus","rectal swabs","clinical isolate","throat","Spearman\u2019s \u03C1","largest lesions","lungs","possible approach","study","attention","conclusion","radiotracer","thoracic regions of mock","ferret model","Strong positive correlations","fluoro-D","replication","glucose","disease dynamics","summary","Viral shedding"],"language":"en"},

We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population.

Unlike human influenza vaccines, strains used for commercially available swine influenza vaccines are not regularly replaced, making the vaccines provide limited protection against antigenically diverse viruses. It is therefore necessary to develop broadly protective swine influenza vaccines that are efficacious to both homologous and heterologous virus infections. In this study, two forms of DNA vaccines were constructed, one was made by fusing M2e to consensus H3HA (MHa), which represents the majority of the HA sequences of H3N2 swine influenza viruses. Another was made by fusing M2e and a conserved CTL epitope (NP147-155) to consensus H3HA (MNHa). Their protective efficacies against homologous and heterologous challenges were tested. RESULTS: BALB/c mice were immunized twice by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) with the two DNA vaccines. It was shown that the two vaccines elicited substantial antibody responses, and MNHa induced more significant T cell-mediated immune response than MHa did. Then two H3N2 strains representative of different evolutional and antigenic clusters were used to challenge the vaccine-immunized mice (homosubtypic challenge). Results indicated that both of the DNA vaccines prevented homosubtypic virus infections completely. The vaccines\u2019 heterologous protective efficacies were further tested by challenging with a H1N1 swine influenza virus and a reassortant 2009 pandemic strain. It was found that MNHa reduced the lung viral titers significantly in both challenge groups, histopathological observation showed obvious reduction of lung pathogenesis as compared to MHa and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combined utility of the consensus HA and the conserved M2e and CTL epitope can confer complete and partial protection against homologous and heterologous challenges, respectively, in mouse model. This may provide a basis for the development of universal swine influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Bin; Yu, Hai; Yang, Fu-Ru; Huang, Meng; Ma, Ji-Hong; Tong, Guang-Zhi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/891adb48f822d8e7f4749448ea5e2b4828c9aae5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3447699.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protective swine influenza vaccines","available swine influenza vaccines","human influenza vaccines","control of swine influenza","development of universal swine influenza vaccines","H1N1 swine influenza virus","forms of DNA vaccines","HA sequences of H3N2 swine influenza viruses","generation of new pandemic influenza strains","heterologous challenges","heterologous virus infections","MNHa","MHa","consensus HA","conserved M2e","challenge groups","homosubtypic challenge","vaccines\u2019 heterologous protective efficacies","consensus H3HA","homosubtypic virus infections","conserved CTL epitope","control groups","RESULTS","vaccine-immunized mice","H3N2 strains representative of different evolutional","partial protection","limited protection","pandemic strain","c mice","diverse viruses","lung viral titers","obvious reduction of lung pathogenesis","histopathological observation","reassortant","significant T cell","antigenic clusters","particle","immune response","gene gun","NP147","mixing reservoir","substantial antibody responses","epidermal delivery","combined utility","public health significance","majority","Pigs","BALB","basis","study","mouse model","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The most comprehensive FGA to date is the GeoChip array, which targets tens of thousands of genes involved in the geochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, metal resistance and reduction, energy processing, antibiotic resistance and contaminant degradation as well as phylogenetic information (gyrB). Since the development of GeoChips, many studies have been performed using this FGA and have shown it to be a powerful tool for rapid, sensitive, and specific examination of microbial communities in a high-throughput manner. As such, the GeoChip is well-suited for linking geochemical processes with microbial community function and structure. This technology has been used successfully to examine microbial communities before, during, and after in situ bioremediation at a variety of contaminated sites.

We have previously characterized lentiviral particles pseudotyped with H5-HA (H5pp) and validated an H5pp-based assay as a safe alternative for high-throughput serological studies in BSL-2 facilities. Here we show that H5-HAs from different clades do not always give rise to efficient production of H5pp and the underlying mechanisms are addressed. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We have carried out mutational analysis to delineate the molecular determinants responsible for efficient packaging of HA from A/Cambodia/40808/2005 (H5Cam) and A/Anhui/1/2005 (H5Anh) into H5pp. Our results demonstrate that a single A134V mutation in the 130-loop of the receptor binding domain is sufficient to render H5Anh the ability to generate H5Anh-pp efficiently, whereas the reverse V134A mutation greatly hampers production of H5Cam-pp. Although protein expression in total cell lysates is similar for H5Anh and H5Cam, cell surface expression of H5Cam is detected at a significantly higher level than that of H5Anh. We further demonstrate by several independent lines of evidence that the behaviour of H5Anh can be explained by a stronger binding to sialic acid receptors implicating residue 134. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a single A134V mutation as the molecular determinant in H5-HA for efficient incorporation into H5pp envelope and delineated the underlying mechanism. The reduced binding to sialic acid receptors as a result of the A134V mutation not only exerts a critical influence in pseudotyping efficiency of H5-HA, but has also an impact at the whole virus level.

Despite observance of their functionality, the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family are complex and currently unknown. Here, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses to unravel the evolutionary history of the vertebrate IFITM family. A total of 174 IFITM orthologous genes and 112 pseudogenes were identified from 27 vertebrate genome sequences. The vertebrate IFITM family can be divided into immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families in phylogeny, implying origins from three different progenitors. In general, vertebrate IFITM genes are located in two loci, one containing the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus containing IFITM5 and various numbers of IR-IFITM genes. Conservation of evolutionary synteny was observed in these IFITM genes. Significant functional divergence was detected among the three IFITM sub-families. No gene duplication or positive selection was found in IFITM5 sub-family, implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution, which is involved in bone formation. No IFITM5 locus was identified in the marmoset genome, suggesting a potential association with the tiny size of this monkey. The IFITM10 sub-family was divided into two groups: aquatic and terrestrial types. Functional divergence was detected between the two groups, and five IFITM10-like genes from frog were dispersed into the two groups. Both gene duplication and positive selection were observed in aquatic vertebrate IFITM10-like genes, indicating that IFITM10 might be associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. A large number of lineage- and species-specific gene duplications were observed in IR-IFITM sub-family and positive selection was detected in IR-IFITM of primates and rodents. Because primates have experienced a long history of viral infection, such rapid expansion and positive selection suggests that the evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes is associated with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhao; Liu, Jun; Li, Meng; Yang, Hui; Zhang, Chiyu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b09362a1f23af2b6603e7b92b58003b7f9719840.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499546.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vertebrate IFITM genes","vertebrate IFITM family","IFITM orthologous genes","IR-IFITM sub-family","IFITM sub-families","evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes","IFITM10 sub-family","gene family","IFITM10 gene","IFITM5 sub-family","aquatic vertebrate IFITM10","immunity-related IFITM","vertebrate evolution","IFITM10 sub-families","positive selection","Vertebrate interferon","IFITM5 locus","functional conservation of IFITM5","vertebrate genome sequences","evolutionary history","groups","evolutionary dynamics","various numbers of IR","Conservation of evolutionary synteny","species-specific gene duplications","detailed evolutionary analyses","evolution of vertebrates","aquatic environments","Significant functional divergence","primates","implying origins","marmoset genome","long history of viral infection","phylogeny","important roles","rapid expansion","potential association","pseudogenes","tiny size","diverse functions","large number of lineage","loci","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","different progenitors","functionality","terrestrial types","adaptation","total","rodents","frog","monkey","observance","bone formation"],"language":"en"},

In addition, retroviruses are widely used as tools to transfer genes of interest to target cells. Understanding the entry mechanism of retroviruses contributes to developments of novel therapeutic approaches against retrovirus-induced diseases and efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors. Entry of enveloped viruses into host cell cytoplasm is achieved by fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes at either the cell surface or intracellular vesicles. Many animal retroviruses enter host cells through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry requires cathepsin proteases activated by the endosome acidification. CD4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to occur via endosomes, but endosome acidification is not necessary for the entry whereas entry of CD4-independent HIVs, which are thought to be prototypes of CD4-dependent viruses, is low pH dependent. There are several controversial results on the retroviral entry pathways. Because endocytosis and endosome acidification are complicatedly controlled by cellular mechanisms, the retrovirus entry pathways may be different in different cell lines.","publish_time":"2012-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubo, Yoshinao; Hayashi, Hideki; Matsuyama, Toshifumi; Sato, Hironori; Yamamoto, Naoki","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05ba033423b8fcd8ca26cf0cf1611e128048f9db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3523128.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of CD4","entry mechanism of retroviruses","endosome acidification","retrovirus entry pathways","retroviral entry pathways","Entry of enveloped viruses","host cell membranes","host cell cytoplasm","CD4-dependent viruses","cell surface","host cells","animal retroviruses","Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry","different cell lines","CD4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus","endosomes","retrovirus-induced diseases","low pH dependent","severe diseases","efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors","cathepsin proteases","developments of novel therapeutic approaches","fusion","cellular mechanisms","humans","infection","infectious agents","viral envelope","controversial results","independent HIVs","animals","intracellular vesicles","genes","tools","endocytosis","addition"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this manuscript is to systematically review the current knowledge on exhaled VOCs with respect to their potential clinical use in asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and respiratory tract infections. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Controlled, clinical, English-language studies exploring the diagnostic and monitoring value of VOCs in asthma, COPD, CF, lung cancer and respiratory tract infections were included. Data on study design, setting, participant characteristics, VOCs techniques, and outcome measures were extracted. Seventy-three studies were included, counting in total 3,952 patients and 2,973 healthy controls. The collection and analysis of exhaled VOCs is non-invasive and could be easily applied in the broad range of patients, including subjects with severe disease and children. Various research groups demonstrated that VOCs profiles could accurately distinguish patients with a pulmonary disease from healthy controls. Pulmonary diseases seem to be characterized by a disease specific breath-print, as distinct profiles were found in patients with dissimilar diseases. The heterogeneity of studies challenged the inter-laboratory comparability. In conclusion, profiles of VOCs are potentially able to accurately diagnose various pulmonary diseases. Despite these promising findings, multiple challenges such as further standardization and validation of the diverse techniques need to be mastered before VOCs can be applied into clinical practice.","publish_time":"2012-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"van de Kant, Kim DG; van der Sande, Linda JTM; J\u00F6bsis, Quirijn; van Schayck, Onno CP; Dompeling, Edward","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3170ca24a432154e425a3f1ed2bf0677d6f3fe63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3549749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3549749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VOCs profiles","profiles of VOCs","VOCs techniques","analysis of exhaled VOCs","various pulmonary diseases","monitoring value of VOCs","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","severe disease","heterogeneity of studies","dissimilar diseases","lung cancer","asthma","COPD","CF","potential of exhaled biomarkers","potential clinical use","distinct profiles","respiratory tract infections","English-language studies","broad range of patients","clinical practice","healthy controls","disease specific breath-print","reference lists of retrieved studies","diverse techniques","Various research groups","respect","PubMed","subjects","diagnostic","Cochrane database","participant characteristics","accurate diagnoses","EMBASE","standardization","management decisions","cystic fibrosis","multiple challenges","volatile organic compounds","current knowledge","study design","validation","inter-laboratory comparability","systematic literature search","outcome measures","promising findings","children","collection","manuscript","conclusion","objective"],"language":"en"},

Alveolar type II (TII) cells have traditionally been considered the immune cells of the alveolar epithelium, as they possess immunomodulatory functions; however, the precise role of alveolar type I (TI) cells, which comprise \u223C95% of the alveolar epithelial surface area, in lung immunity is not clear. We sought to determine if there was a difference in the response of TI and TII cells to lung injury and if TI cells could actively participate in the alveolar immune response. TI cells isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from LPS-injured rats demonstrated greater fold-induction of multiple inflammatory mediators than TII cells isolated in the same manner from the same animals. Levels of the cytokines TNF-\u03B1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03B2 from cultured primary rat TI cells after LPS stimulation were significantly increased compared to similarly studied primary rat TII cells. We found that contrary to published reports, cultured TII cells produce relatively small amounts of TNF-\u03B1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03B2 after LPS treatment; the higher levels of cytokine expression from cultured TII cells reported in the literature were likely from macrophage contamination due to traditional non-FACS TII cell isolation methods. Co-culture of TII cells with macrophages prior to LPS stimulation increased TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 production to levels reported by other investigators for TII cells, however, co-culture of TI cells and macrophages prior to LPS treatment resulted in marked increases in TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 production.

However, little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of ICU patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to ICU for severe S. pneumoniae CAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of two prospectively-acquired multicentre ICU databases (2001-2008). Patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal CAP were enrolled if they met the 2001 American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia, had life-threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for S. pneumoniae. Patients with bronchitis, aspiration pneumonia or with non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty two patients were included, with a median SAPS II score reaching 47 [36-64]. Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77%) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84%); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32%). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7%. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3% of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95% CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome.","publish_time":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mongardon, Nicolas; Max, Adeline; Bougl\u00E9, Adrien; P\u00E8ne, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Lemiale, Virginie; Charpentier, Julien; Cariou, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Bedos, Jean-Pierre; Mira, Jean-Paul","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3580745.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580745/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzczMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae","Bacteraemia"],"organizations":["ICU","CAP","SAPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of ICU patients","pneumococcal pneumonia","mortality of pneumococcal CAP","severe pneumonia","renal replacement therapy","management of severe pneumococcal CAP","risk factors of mortality","multicentre ICU databases","aspiration pneumonia","Streptococcus pneumoniae","high proportion of ICU admissions","pneumoniae strains","hospital mortality","frequent causes of ICU admission","penicillin susceptibility","non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections","septic shock","independent risk factors","decreased susceptibility","epidemiological data","adverse outcome","life-threatening organ failure","Baseline demographic data","Acute respiratory failure","adequate antimicrobial treatment","macrolide administration","concomitant bacteremia","major impact","American Thoracic Society criteria","main pathogen responsible","positive microbiological sample","METHODS","account","Co-morbidities","multivariate analysis","bronchitis","clinical features","study","prevalence","cases","Community","retrospective review","median SAPS","mechanical ventilation","score","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","male sex","aims","antibiotherapy","Bacteraemia","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is strongly, positively and significantly correlated with genome size.

We also demonstrate that the sequence as found in human is capable of directing eGFP to the nucleolus in several mammal, fish and insect cells. Moreover, this NoLS is capable of specifically directing the cytosolic yeast enzyme polyphosphatase to the target of the nucleolus of HeLa cells, wherein its enzymatic activity was detected.

Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in AMD, but precise mechanisms remain poorly defined. Carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) is an AMD-associated lipid peroxidation product. We previously demonstrated that mice immunized with CEP-modified albumin developed AMD-like degenerative changes in the outer retina. Here, we examined the kinetics of lesion development in immunized mice and the presence of macrophages within the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), between the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor outer segments. We observed a significant and time-dependent increase in the number of macrophages in immunized mice relative to young age-matched controls prior to overt pathology. These changes were more pronounced in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. Importantly, IPM-infiltrating macrophages were polarized toward the M1 phenotype but only in immunized mice. Moreover, when Ccr2-deficient mice were immunized, macrophages were not present in the IPM and no retinal lesions were observed, suggesting a deleterious role for these cells in our model. This work provides mechanistic evidence linking immune responses against oxidative damage with the presence of proinflammatory macrophages at sites of future AMD and experimentally demonstrates that manipulating immunity may be a target for modulating the development of AMD.","publish_time":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz-Guilloty, Fernando; Saeed, Ali M.; Echegaray, Jose J.; Duffort, Stephanie; Ballmick, Asha; Tan, Yaohong; Betancourt, Michel; Viteri, Eduardo; Ramkhellawan, Ghansham C.; Ewald, Eric; Feuer, William; Huang, DeQiang; Wen, Rong; Hong, Li; Wang, Hua; Laird, James M.; Sene, Abdoulaye; Apte, Rajendra S.; Salomon, Robert G.; Hollyfield, Joe G.; Perez, Victor L.","journal":"Int J Inflam","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d08ac6ac9dd268022b8cbe5cba116dd2bd12f757.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3606733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunized mice relative","development of AMD","c mice","presence of macrophages","number of macrophages","IPM-infiltrating macrophages","Ccr2-deficient mice","presence of proinflammatory macrophages","sites of future AMD","AMD-associated lipid peroxidation product","oxidative damage","degenerative changes","Oxidative stress","outer retina","retinal lesions","developed world","retinal pigment epithelium","photoreceptor outer segments","CEP-modified albumin","kinetics of lesion development","young age-matched controls","immune responses","mechanistic evidence","BALB","time-dependent increase","major cause of blindness","overt pathology","M1 phenotype","work","interphotoreceptor matrix","C57BL","Age-related macular degeneration","cells","deleterious role","precise mechanisms","target","inflammation","model","immunity","Carboxyethylpyrrole"],"language":"en"},

By imposing a number of modifying assumptions to the observable model, we let it mimic the unobservable model, identifying that the two models are fully consistent only when the incubation period is identical to the latent period and when there is no pre-symptomatic transmission. We also computed the reproduction numbers with and without vaccination, demonstrating that the data generating process of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness is consistent with the observable model only and examining how the effective reproduction number is differently calculated by two models. CONCLUSIONS: To explicitly incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of symptomatic illness into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression. More modeling studies based on observable epidemiological information are called for.","publish_time":"2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ejima, Keisuke; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75f36f193e2cbaa2f34b23bfc645dd441551bd51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3625221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3625221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unobservable model","clinical illness","risk of symptomatic illness","observable variables","impact of model building strategy","observable epidemiological information","pre-symptomatic transmission","presence of vaccine effect","process of vaccine","unobservable information of infection event","different types of mathematical models","likely effectiveness of vaccination","effective reproduction number","latent period","incubation period","infectious disease","asymptomatic transmission","disease progression","reproduction numbers","induced reduction","symptom onset","recovery","infectiousness","epidemic threshold","modeling studies","data","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","way","assumptions","METHODOLOGY","present study","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChip\u00AE microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was present in prefusion palatal epithelium and was degraded during fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1 (\u2212/\u2212)) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. TGF\u03B23 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not affected in the palate of Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212)mice.

Can we garner any clues as to why this might be by considering comparative immunology and the evolutionary emergence of adaptive and innate immunity? The immune system is assumed to have evolved to protect the organism against pathogens, but the way in which this is accomplished is different in the innate-vs-adaptive arms, and it is unclear why the latter is necessary. Are there special characteristics of adaptive immunity which might make the system more susceptible to age-associated dysfunction? Given recent accumulating findings that actually there are age-associated changes to innate immunity and that these are broadly similar in vertebrates and invertebrates, we suggest here that it is the special property of memory in the adaptive immune system which results in the accumulation of cells with a restricted receptor repertoire, dependent on the immunological history of the individual\u2019s exposures to pathogens over the lifetime, and which is commonly taken as a hallmark of \u201Cimmunosenescence\u201D. However, we further hypothesize that this immunological remodelling per se does not necessarily convey a disadvantage to the individual (ie. is not necessarily \u201Csenescence\u201D if it is not deleterious). Indeed, under certain circumstances, or potentially even as a rule, this adaptation to the individual host environment may confer an actual survival advantage.","publish_time":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Ludmila; F\u00FCl\u00F6p, Tamas; Pawelec, Graham","journal":"Immun Ageing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a89118d20a0cdc24d50b510ba793fb3fbd468afd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3637519.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immunity","adaptive arm of immunity","adaptive immune system","adaptive arms","special characteristics of adaptive immunity","evolutionary emergence of adaptive","age-associated changes","age-associated dysfunction","innate-vs","pathogens","deleterious changes","immunosenescence","immunological history","immunological remodelling","individual host environment","special property of memory","restricted receptor repertoire","individual\u2019s exposures","accumulation of cells","T cell subset","actual survival advantage","adaptation","comparative immunology","lifetime","recent accumulating findings","invertebrates","organism","way","disadvantage","rule","established consensus","certain circumstances","hallmark","clues"],"language":"en"},

Induction of cell death following reovirus infection is initiated by the incoming viral capsid proteins during cell entry and occurs via NF-\u03BAB-dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways. Prototype reovirus strain T3D displays a higher cell-killing potential than strain T1L. To investigate how signaling pathways initiated by T3D and T1L differ, we methodically analyzed cell death pathways activated by these two viruses in L929 cells. We found that T3D activates NF-\u03BAB, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a significantly greater extent than T1L. Surprisingly, blockade of NF-\u03BAB or caspases did not affect T3D-induced cell death. Cell death following T3D infection resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP levels and was sensitive to inhibition of the kinase activity of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms.","publish_time":"2013-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, Angela K.; Danthi, Pranav","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98788dfeef7084c7c15a66c0f83b521f586bdde0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3656442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Induction of cell death","cell death pathways","T3D-induced cell death","cell entry","higher cell","T3D infection","reovirus infection","primary mechanism of cell death","necrotic form of cell death","Prototype reovirus strain T3D","membranes of T3D","NF-\u03BAB","effector caspases","initiator caspases","host cells","dispensability of caspases","L929 cells","induction of necroptosis","strain T1L","induction of apoptosis","reovirus replication cycle","physiological status of infected cells","blockade of NF","RIP1 kinase function","Virus-induced apoptosis","incoming viral capsid proteins","step distinct","distinct mechanisms","dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways","synthesis of viral RNA","kinase activity of receptor","inhibition","cellular ATP levels","different events","requirement","reduction","alternate","greater extent","potential","viruses","studies"],"language":"en"},

TYMV encodes a precursor replication polyprotein that is processed by the endoproteolytic activity of its internal cysteine proteinase domain (PRO). We recently reported that PRO is actually a multifunctional enzyme with a specific ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity that contributes to viral infectivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 150-residue PRO. Strikingly, PRO displays no homology to other processing proteinases from positive-stranded RNA viruses, including that of alphaviruses. Instead, the closest structural homologs of PRO are DUBs from the Ovarian tumor (OTU) family. In the crystal, one molecule\u0027s C-terminus inserts into the catalytic cleft of the next, providing a view of the N-terminal product complex in replication polyprotein processing. This allows us to locate the specificity determinants of PRO for its proteinase substrates. In addition to the catalytic cleft, at the exit of which the active site is unusually pared down and solvent-exposed, a key element in molecular recognition by PRO is a lobe N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Docking models and the activities of PRO and PRO mutants in a deubiquitylating assay suggest that this N-terminal lobe is also likely involved in PRO\u0027s DUB function. Our data thus establish that DUBs can evolve to specifically hydrolyze both iso- and endopeptide bonds with different sequences. This is achieved by the use of multiple specificity determinants, as recognition of substrate patches distant from the cleavage sites allows a relaxed specificity of PRO at the sites themselves.

With enhanced cellular uptake, the constructed AL/CS/DNA nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX into nasal mucosa. TEM results showed the AL/CS/DNA had a spherical structure. High DNA loading ability and effective DNA protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis.

In comparison to the traditional CS/DNA system, our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the AL/CS/DNA at nasal mucosal surface. These outstanding features enable the AL/CS/DNA to induce a significantly (p\u003C0.01) higher level of secretory IgA (SIgA) than the CS/DNA in animal study, and a longer-term mucosal immunity.

A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways.

We demonstrate that these defective viral genomes (DVGs) are generated naturally during respiratory infections in vivo even in mice lacking the type I IFN receptor, and their appearance coincides with the production of cytokines during infections with Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza virus.

Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ. The study population included healthy controls (n=5), patients with CHB (n=5) and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=5). Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls, patients with CHB and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=3, respectively). Using iTRAQ analysis, 16 different serum proteins with \u22651.5-fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls. Five of those proteins, C-reactive protein precursor, hemoglobin \u03B2 chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin, which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases, were subsequently verified using western blotting. The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ. Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process, and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV-induced ACLF remain unclear.

In addition to the previously described membrane-associated form of ELR1, two other major alternative splicing variant mRNAs were identified in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). One major spliced species (ELR1-IN) contained an insertion of 153 nt, which resulted in a premature stop codon situated 561 nt upstream of the predicted membrane spanning domain. The other major species (ELR1-DE) has a deletion of 109 nt that causes a shift of the open reading frame and generates a stop codon 312 nt downstream. Because ELR1-DE presumably encodes a peptide of a mere 23 residues, only ELR1-IN was further analyzed. The expression of a soluble form of ELR1 (sELR1) by ELR1-IN was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Similar to ELR1, the transcription level of ELR1-IN varied among individual horses and at different time points in the same individuals. The ratio of ELR1-IN mRNA species to ELR1 mRNA was approximately 1\u22362.5. Pre-incubation of the recombinant sELR1 with EIAV significantly inhibited EIAV infection in equine macrophages, the primary in vivo target cell of the virus. Fetal equine dermal (FED) cells are susceptible to EIAV in vitro, and the replication of EIAV in FED cells transiently transfected with ELR1-IN was markedly reduced when compared with replication in cells transfected with the empty vector. Finally, the expression levels of both forms of the EIAV receptor were significantly regulated by infection with this virus. Taken together, our data indicate that sELR1 acts as a secreted cellular factor that inhibits EIAV infection in host cells.","publish_time":"2013-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yue-Zhi; Yang, Fei; Zhang, Shu-Qin; Sun, Liu-Ke; Wang, Xue-Feng; Du, Cheng; Zhou, Jian-Hua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf256a0f8fd3ff2faa39f340180e7e19bfa4c295.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3838338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIAV","FED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELR1 mRNA","ratio of ELR1","EIAV receptor","soluble form of ELR1","transcription level of ELR1","replication of EIAV","described membrane-associated form of ELR1","inhibited EIAV infection","equine macrophages","Equine lentivirus receptor","FED cells","major species","equine infectious anemia virus","sole receptor","host cells","mRNA species","major spliced species","equine monocyte-derived macrophages","recombinant sELR1","sELR1 acts","tumor necrosis factor receptor","premature stop codon","predicted membrane","expression levels","major alternative splicing variant mRNAs","secreted cellular factor","different time points","individual horses","TNFR","member","open reading frame","target cell","shift","superfamily","eMDMs","forms","Western blot","Pre-incubation","immunofluorescence analyses","individuals","peptide","residues","domain","addition","data","insertion","deletion","vector"],"language":"en"},

Much is known about genetic susceptibility, uptake and dissemination of PrP(Sc) in the body, but many aspects of prion diseases are still unknown. Different proteomic techniques have been used during the last decade to investigate differences in protein profiles between affected animals and healthy controls. We have investigated the protein profiles in serum of sheep with scrapie and healthy controls by SELDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS. Latent Variable methods such as Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis and Target Projection methods were used to describe the MS data. RESULTS: The serum proteomic profiles showed variable differences between the groups both throughout the incubation period and at the clinical end stage of scrapie. At the end stage, the target projection model separated the two groups with a sensitivity of 97.8%, and serum amyloid A was identified as one of the protein peaks that differed significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: At the clinical end stage of classical scrapie, ten SELDI peaks significantly discriminated the scrapie group from the healthy controls. During the non-clinical incubation period, individual SELDI peaks were differently expressed between the groups at different time points. Investigations of differences in -omic profiles can contribute to new insights into the underlying disease processes and pathways, and advance our understanding of prion diseases, but comparison and validation across laboratories is difficult and challenging.","publish_time":"2013-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meling, Siv; Kvalheim, Olav M; Arneberg, Reidar; B\u00E5rdsen, Kjetil; Hjelle, Anne; Ulvund, Martha J","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ff6f535016d7b46687474786efd07db9c19ce8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3843553.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3843553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["groups","clinical end stage of scrapie","protein profiles","clinical end stage of classical scrapie","scrapie group","serum proteomic profiles","healthy controls","protein peaks","variable differences","serum of sheep","individual SELDI peaks","SELDI-TOF","non-clinical incubation period","Target Projection methods","conversion PrP","dissemination of PrP","LC-MS","Investigations of differences","MS data","serum amyloid","Latent Variable methods","target projection model","aspects of prion diseases","understanding of prion diseases","Different proteomic techniques","Squares-Discriminant Analysis","Principal Component Analysis","fatal neurodegenerative disease","underlying disease processes","different time points","validation","comparison","new insights","affected animals","uptake","laboratories","pathways","body","genetic susceptibility","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","decade","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

This virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries. The clinical presentation of PRRSV ranges from asymptomatic to devastating. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR assay to evaluate the viremia of natural PRRSV-infected pigs in Taiwan. Serum samples were collected from 577 pigs aged 5\u201312 weeks. These include 444 clinically healthy pigs and 133 symptomatic pigs were confirmed to have porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). RESULTS: Viremia was quantified in 79 of the 444 (17.8%) clinically healthy pigs and in 112 of the 133 (84.2%) PRDC cases. Viremias were significantly more common in pigs with PRDC compared with the clinically healthy pigs (P \u003C0.0001). These results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of PRRSV-affected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: ZNA probe-based real-time PCR can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic PRRSV-infected pigs.

To gain a better understanding of the relationship between perkinsids, dinoflagellates and other alveolates, we analyzed the nuclear-encoded spliced-leader (SL) RNA and mitochondrial genes, intron prevalence, and multi-protein phylogenies. In contrast to the canonical 22-nt SL found in dinoflagellates (DinoSL), P. marinus has a shorter (21-nt) and a longer (22-nt) SL with slightly different sequences than DinoSL. The major SL RNA transcripts range in size between 80\u201383 nt in P. marinus, and \u223C83 nt in P. chesapeaki, significantly larger than the typical \u226456-nt dinoflagellate SL RNA. In most of the phylogenetic trees based on 41 predicted protein sequences, P. marinus branched at the base of the dinoflagellate clade that included the ancient taxa Oxyrrhis and Amoebophrya, sister to the clade of apicomplexans, and in some cases clustered with apicomplexans as a sister to the dinoflagellate clade. Of 104 Perkinsus spp. genes examined 69.2% had introns, a higher intron prevalence than in dinoflagellates. Examination of Perkinsus spp. mitochondrial cytochrome B and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I genes and their cDNAs revealed no mRNA editing, but these transcripts can only be translated when frameshifts are introduced at every AGG and CCC codon as if AGGY codes for glycine and CCCCU for proline. These results, along with the presence of the numerous uncharacterized \u2018marine alveolate group I\u0027 and Perkinsus-like lineages separating perkinsids from core dinoflagellates, expand support for the affiliation of the genus Perkinsus with an independent lineage (Perkinsozoa) positioned between the phyla of Apicomplexa and Dinoflagellata.","publish_time":"2011-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Huan; Campbell, David A.; Sturm, Nancy R.; Dungan, Christopher F.; Lin, Senjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94a4251b88b47417be1ebffe98259c1d4c1e0b36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3101222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3101222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. marinus","Dinoflagellata"],"organizations":["Perkinsus","AGG","CCC","AGGY"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nt SL","nt dinoflagellate SL RNA","genus Perkinsus","Examination of Perkinsus","dinoflagellate clade","marinus","major SL RNA transcripts","mitochondrial genes","core dinoflagellates","clade of apicomplexans","perkinsids","sister","DinoSL","mitochondrial cytochrome B","higher intron prevalence","predicted protein sequences","different sequences","phylogenetic trees","multi-protein phylogenies","precarious phylogenetic position","cytochrome C oxidase subunit","AGGY codes","ancient taxa Oxyrrhis","marine alveolate group","glycine","cDNAs","Amoebophrya","support","size","CCC codon","spliced-leader","presence","CCCCU","Perkinsozoa","relationship","independent lineage","introns","lineages","affiliation","mRNA editing","proline","better understanding","chesapeaki","alveolates","cases","base","phyla of Apicomplexa","Dinoflagellata","frameshifts","contrast","results"],"language":"en"},

Type 1 interferons (IFNs) have the potential to activate STAT4 and promote IFN-\u03B3 expression, but concurrent induction of elevated STAT1 negatively regulates access to the pathway. As a consequence, it has been difficult to detect type 1 IFN stimulation of NK cell IFN-\u03B3 during viral infections in the presence of STAT1 and to understand the evolutionary advantage for maintaining the pathway. The studies reported here evaluated NK cell responses following infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the compartment handling the earliest events after infection, the peritoneal cavity. The production of type 1 IFNs, both IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2, was shown to be early and of short duration, peaking at 30 h after challenge. NK cell IFN-\u03B3 expression was detected with overlapping kinetics and required activating signals delivered through type 1 IFN receptors and STAT4. It took place under conditions of high STAT4 levels but preceded elevated STAT1 expression in NK cells. The IFN-\u03B3 response reduced viral burdens. Interestingly, increases in STAT1 were delayed in NK cells compared to other peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. Taken together, the studies demonstrate a novel mechanism for stimulating IFN-\u03B3 production and elucidate a biological role for type 1 IFN access to STAT4 in NK cells.","publish_time":"2011-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mack, Ethan A.; Kallal, Lara E.; Demers, Delia A.; Biron, Christine A.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e846076762b54e33385752eb27e086f6cb8b72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3150756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN stimulation of NK cell IFN-\u03B3","IFN access","IFN-\u03B3 production","NK cell IFN-\u03B3 expression","IFN-\u03B3 response","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B1","IFN receptors","NK cells","NK cell responses","production of type","elevated STAT1 expression","conditions of high STAT4 levels","presence of STAT1","peritoneal exudate cell","viral infections","concurrent induction of elevated STAT1","IFNs","studies","pathway","express high levels","viral burdens","peritoneal cavity","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","signal transducer","biological role","activating signals","compartment","LCMV","overlapping kinetics","earliest events","activator of transcription","novel mechanism","PEC","populations","place","cytokine gamma interferon","potential","short duration","evolutionary advantage","interferons","Natural killer","challenge","consequence"],"language":"en"},

We found that CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 were significantly raised in the acute phase compared to follow-up samples. Furthermore, IL-1\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, Il-12, IL-10, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-5 had low initial acute phase levels that significantly increased at later time points. Analysis of symptom severity showed association with CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10 and IgG levels. These data give insight into Chikungunya disease establishment and subsequent convalescence, which is imperative to the treatment and containment of this quickly evolving and frequently re-emerging disease.","publish_time":"2011-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelvin, Alyson A.; Banner, David; Silvi, Giuliano; Moro, Maria Luisa; Spataro, Nadir; Gaibani, Paolo; Cavrini, Francesca; Pierro, Anna; Rossini, Giada; Cameron, Mark J.; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F.; Paquette, St\u00E9phane G.; Xu, Luoling; Danesh, Ali; Farooqui, Amber; Borghetto, Ilaria; Kelvin, David J.; Sambri, Vittorio; Rubino, Salvatore","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87dda3063b97a87338264b45ae16045e46cb237b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3156690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Asia","North America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["acute phase of Chikungunya disease","Chikungunya disease establishment","Chikungunya virus infection zones","re-emerging disease","Chikungunya immunological progression","low initial acute phase levels","CXCL9","serum levels","MIG","IgG levels","CXCL10","IP","recent virus genetic mutation","month post-infection follow-up","follow-up samples","large-scale fatalities","patients","widespread economic loss","association","chemokines","subsequent convalescence","insight","cytokines","North America","parts of Asia","mild symptoms","Africa","Analysis of symptom severity","evolution","paucity of information","data","CCL2","MCP","TNF-\u03B1","Italian outbreak","IFN-\u03B3","Europe","later time points","treatment","containment"],"language":"en"},

At present, HFRS is getting worse with increasing cases and natural foci in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we applied a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the objective of monitoring and short-term forecasting HFRS incidence in China. METHODS: Chinese HFRS data from 1975 to 2008 were used to fit ARIMA model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Ljung-Box test were used to evaluate the constructed models. Subsequently, the fitted ARIMA model was applied to obtain the fitted HFRS incidence from 1978 to 2008 and contrast with corresponding observed values. To assess the validity of the proposed model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the observed and fitted HFRS incidence (1978-2008) was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA model was used to forecast the incidence of HFRS of the years 2009 to 2011. All analyses were performed using SAS9.1 with a significant level of p \u003C 0.05. RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit test of the optimum ARIMA (0,3,1) model showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (Ljung-Box Q statistic = 5.95,P = 0.3113). The fitted values made by ARIMA (0,3,1) model for years 1978-2008 closely followed the observed values for the same years, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.20%. The forecast values from 2009 to 2011 were 0.69, 0.86, and 1.21per 100,000 population, respectively. CONCLUSION: ARIMA models applied to historical HFRS incidence data are an important tool for HFRS surveillance in China. This study shows that accurate forecasting of the HFRS incidence is possible using an ARIMA model. If predicted values from this study are accurate, China can expect a rise in HFRS incidence.","publish_time":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qiyong; Liu, Xiaodong; Jiang, Baofa; Yang, Weizhong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e00f18c8b764d9e0d3d78cda3dd4b6a078257be5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3169483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozcy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFRS","ARIMA","Akaike Information Criterion"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["incidence of HFRS","fitted HFRS incidence","HFRS cases","HFRS surveillance","control of HFRS","fitted ARIMA model","historical HFRS incidence data","short-term forecasting HFRS incidence","Chinese HFRS data","proposed model","ARIMA models","China","fitted values","optimum ARIMA","forecast values","years","study","corresponding observed values","predicted values","mean absolute percentage error","accurate forecasting","MAPE","Ljung-Box test","fit test","significant level of p","objective of monitoring","Ljung-Box Q statistic","increasing cases","constructed models","non-significant autocorrelations","important tool","AIC","stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average","natural foci","residuals","hemorrhagic fever","renal syndrome","contrast","Akaike Information Criterion","rise","urgent need","SAS9","goodness","CONCLUSION","METHODS","BACKGROUND","country","validity","present","analyses","RESULTS","population"],"language":"en"},

ID injection by the Mantoux technique requires special training and may not reliably target skin, but is nonetheless used currently for BCG and rabies vaccination. Scarification using a bifurcated needle was extensively used for smallpox eradication, but provides variable and inefficient delivery into the skin. Recently, ID vaccination has been simplified by introduction of a simple-to-use hollow microneedle that has been approved for ID injection of influenza vaccine in Europe. Various designs of hollow microneedles have been studied preclinically and in humans. Vaccines can also be injected into skin using needle-free devices, such as jet injection, which is receiving renewed clinical attention for ID vaccination. Projectile delivery using powder and gold particles (i.e., gene gun) have also been used clinically for ID vaccination. Building off the scarification approach, a number of preclinical studies have examined solid microneedle patches for use with vaccine coated onto metal microneedles, encapsulated within dissolving microneedles or added topically to skin after microneedle pretreatment, as well as adapting tattoo guns for ID vaccination. Finally, technologies designed to increase skin permeability in combination with a vaccine patch have been studied through the use of skin abrasion, ultrasound, electroporation, chemical enhancers, and thermal ablation. The prospects for bringing ID vaccination into more widespread clinical practice are encouraging, given the large number of technologies for ID delivery under development.","publish_time":"2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Y.

In the Netherlands, all deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection had to be notified, both during the 2009-2010 pandemic season and the 2010-2011 influenza season. To assess whether and to what extent pandemic mortality patterns were reverting back to seasonal patterns, a retrospective analyses of all notified fatal cases associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection was performed. METHODS: The notification database, including detailed information about the clinical characteristics of all notified deaths, was used to perform a comprehensive analysis of all deceased patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection. Characteristics of the fatalities with respect to age and underlying medical conditions were analysed, comparing the 2009-2010 pandemic and the 2010-2011 influenza season. RESULTS: A total of 65 fatalities with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection were notified in 2009-2010 and 38 in 2010-2011. During the pandemic season, the population mortality rates peaked in persons aged 0-15 and 55-64 years.

To develop potent HA inhibitors, the ZINC fragment database was searched for finding the optimal compound with the core hopping technique. As a result, the Neo6 compound was obtained. It has been shown through the subsequent molecular docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations that Neo6 not only assumes more favorable conformation at the binding pocket of HA but also has stronger binding interaction with its receptor.

To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have focused on the direct cytopathic effects of individual HCV proteins, with the objective of identifying their specific roles in the overall pathogenesis. However, this approach precludes examination of the possible interactions between different HCV proteins and organelles. To obtain a better understanding of the various cytopathic effects of and cellular responses to HCV proteins, we used human hepatoma cells constitutively replicating HCV RNA encoding either the full-length polyprotein or the non-structural proteins, or cells constitutively expressing the structural protein core, to model the state of persistent HCV infection and examined the combination of various HCV proteins in cellular pathogenesis. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the mitochondria, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, and increased lipid accumulation were common among all HCV protein-expressing cells regardless of whether they expressed the structural or non-structural proteins. Expression of the non-structural proteins also led to increased oxidative stress in the cytosol, membrane blebbing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Alterations of cellular redox state, on the other hand, significantly changed the level of autophagy, suggesting a direct link between oxidative stress and HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. With the wide-spread cytopathic effects, cells with the full-length HCV polyprotein showed a modest antioxidant response and exhibited a significant increase in population doubling time and a concomitant decrease in cyclin D1. In contrast, cells expressing the non-structural proteins were able to launch a vigorous antioxidant response with up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. The population doubling time and cyclin D1 level were also comparable to that of control cells. Finally, the cytopathic effects of core protein appeared to focus on the mitochondria without remarkable disturbances in the cytosol.","publish_time":"2011-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Victor C.; Bhattacharya, Sayanti; Nomoto, Ann; Lin, Jiahui; Zaidi, Syed Kashif; Oberley, Terry D.; Weinman, Steven A.; Azhar, Salman; Huang, Ting-Ting","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/523d27d193f6bd636b6fae4da4af51ea66907772.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["different HCV proteins","HCV RNA","non-structural proteins","combination of various HCV proteins","full-length HCV polyprotein","direct cytopathic effects of individual HCV proteins","state of persistent HCV infection","HCV-mediated activation of autophagy","control cells","various cytopathic effects","cytopathic effects of core protein","cellular pathogenesis","human hepatoma cells","increased oxidative stress","structural protein core","full-length polyprotein","modest antioxidant response","time","vigorous antioxidant response","cellular responses","cytosol","population","increased lipid accumulation","cyclin D1 level","level of autophagy","overall pathogenesis","Alterations of cellular redox state","regulation of antioxidant enzymes","liver cancer","direct link","accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles","major cause of chronic liver disease","possible interactions","endoplasmic reticulum","degeneration","membrane blebbing","mitochondrial injury","significant increase","ROS","concomitant decrease","objective","recent studies","reactive oxygen species","examination","specific roles","better understanding","organelles","United States","approach","remarkable disturbances","hand","contrast","Expression"],"language":"en"},

We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect on the ability of the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG15ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other than ubiquitin and ISG15 may be involved in the actions of the viral OTU.","publish_time":"2011-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holzer, Barbara; Bakshi, Siddharth; Bridgen, Anne; Baron, Michael D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4aa19640fd1b1a8fc71b31d32fe6009c992bd767.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3230622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NSDV","OTU"],"locations":["East Africa"],"keyphrases":["viral OTU","induction of type","action of type","OTU domain","interferon action","ability of NSDV","Dugbe virus","Virus infection","Ganjam virus","antagonising interferon induction","actions of interferon","sections of viral proteins","transient expression of viral proteins","Nairobi sheep disease virus","protease domain","viral RNA polymerase","interferons","Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus","host cell proteins","ISG15 protein","incorporation of ubiquitin","apparent effect","protease activity","lesser effect","livestock animals","pathogens of man","important group of tick-borne viruses","activities","transfected cells","large parts of East Africa","great reduction","ovarian tumour","targets","ubiquitination","Indian subcontinent","peripheral site","Nairoviruses","apathogenic isolates","ISG15ylation","signalling pathways","mutations"],"language":"en"},

A deep characterization of PN-SIA28 features may represent a useful help in the improvement of available anti-influenza therapeutic strategies and can provide new tools for the development of universal vaccinal strategies.","publish_time":"2011-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clementi, Nicola; De Marco, Donata; Mancini, Nicasio; Solforosi, Laura; Moreno, Guisella J.; Gubareva, Larisa V.; Mishin, Vasiliy; Di Pietro, Andrea; Vicenzi, Elisa; Siccardi, Antonio G.; Clementi, Massimo; Burioni, Roberto","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab15d5ebce1f5f7cf0e689d32a55701e9e8fcde3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3230632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different influenza subtypes","PN-SIA28","H9N2 subtypes","subtypes responsible","subtypes H1","divergent subtypes","capable of neutralizing isolates","tested isolates","viral isolates","H3N2 isolates","SIA28 features","improvement of available anti-influenza therapeutic strategies","different HA-based influenza phylogenetic groups","therapeutic tools","stem region of HA","single mAbs","deep characterization of PN","identification of anti-hemagglutinin","new tools","development of universal vaccinal strategies","capable of binding","pandemic potential","residues","useful help","H1N1","H2N2","H5N1","monoclonal antibodies","prophylactic","reported pandemics","design","activity","date","period","heterosubtypic","human mAb","majority","H3 subtype"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, Issue 5, 2010) to identify all reviews of CHM. A total of fifty-eight reviews were eligible for our study. Twenty-one of the included reviews had at least one Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner as its co-author. 7 reviews didn\u0027t include any primary study, the remaining reviews (n = 51) included a median of 9 studies and 936 participants. 50% of reviews were last assessed as up-to-date prior to 2008. The questions addressed by 39 reviews were broad in scope, in which 9 reviews combined studies with different herbal medicines. For OQAQ, the mean of overall quality score (item 10) was 5.05 (95% CI; 4.58-5.52). All reviews assessed the methodological quality of primary studies, 16% of included primary studies used adequate sequence generation and 7% used adequate allocation concealment. Of the 51 nonempty reviews, 23 reviews were reported as being inconclusive, while 27 concluded that there might be benefit of CHM, which was limited by the poor quality or inadequate quantity of included studies. 58 reviews reported searching a median of seven electronic databases, while 10 reviews did not search any Chinese database. CONCLUSIONS: Now CDSR has included large numbers of CHM reviews, our study identified some areas which could be improved, such as almost half of included reviews did not have the participation of TCM practitioners and were not up-to-date according to Cochrane criteria, some reviews pooled the results of different herbal medicines and ignored the searching of Chinese databases.","publish_time":"2011-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Jing; Zhang, Junhua; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Yongling; Zhang, Li; Shang, Hongcai","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35593b9b140bf1c91c758584ed4e924dd7798436.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3235143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3235143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","TCM","CDSR","CHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["remaining reviews","nonempty reviews","half of included reviews","methodological quality of included reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","large numbers of CHM reviews","existing systematic reviews of Chinese herbal medicines","methodological quality of primary studies","primary study","inadequate quantity of included studies","searching of Chinese databases","poor quality","systematic search","results of different herbal medicines","Traditional Chinese Medicine","CDSR","Cochrane criteria","Cochrane Library","median","OBJECTIVES","mean of overall quality score","electronic databases","adequate sequence generation","participation of TCM practitioners","adequate allocation concealment","item","Issue","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","OQAQ","scope","total","METHODOLOGY","co-author","CONCLUSIONS","participants","questions","areas"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we evaluated the value of the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea), a newly developed multiplex PCR kit employing dual priming oligonucleotide methods, for diagnosing acute meningitis. METHODS: Analytical sensitivity of the kit was studied using reference strains for each pathogen targeted by the kit, while it\u0027s analytical specificity was studied using the human genome DNA and 58 clinically well-identified reference strains. For clinical validation experiment, we used 27 control cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 78 clinical CSF samples collected from patients at the time of diagnosis of acute meningitis. RESULTS: The lower detection limits ranged from 10(1) copies/\u00B5L to 5\u00D710(1) copies/\u00B5L for the 12 viral and bacterial pathogens targeted. No cross-reaction was observed. In the validation study, high detection rate of 56.4% was obtained. None of the control samples tested positive, i.e., false-positive results were absent.

Overcoming immune subversion is critical for developing vaccines and other measures to control this devastating swine virus. The overall goal of this work was to enhance innate and adaptive immunity following vaccination through the expression of interferon (IFN) genes by the PRRSV genome. We have constructed a series of recombinant PRRS viruses using an infectious PRRSV cDNA clone (pCMV-P129). Coding regions of exogenous genes, which included Renilla luciferase (Rluc), green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP and DsRed, respectively) and several interferons (IFNs), were constructed and expressed through a unique subgenomic mRNA placed between ORF1b and ORF2 of the PRRSV infectious clone. The constructs, which expressed Rluc, GFP, DsRed, efficiently produced progeny viruses and mimicked the parental virus in both MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages. In contrast, replication of IFN-expressing viruses was attenuated, similar to the level of replication observed after the addition of exogenous IFN. Furthermore, the IFN expressing viruses inhibited the replication of a second PRRS virus co-transfected or co-infected. Inhibition by the different IFN subtypes corresponded to their anti-PRRSV activity, i.e., IFN\u03C95 \u00B0 IFN\u03B11 \u003E IFN-\u03B2 \u003E IFN\u03B43. In summary, the indicator-expressing viruses provided an efficient means for real-time monitoring of viral replication thus allowing high\u2011throughput elucidation of the role of host factors in PRRSV infection. This was shown when they were used to clearly demonstrate the involvement of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) in the early stage of PRRSV infection. In addition, replication\u2011competent IFN-expressing viruses may be good candidates for development of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines, which are capable of reversing subverted innate immune responses and may induce more effective adaptive immunity against PRRSV infection.","publish_time":"2012-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sang, Yongming; Shi, Jishu; Sang, Wenjing; Rowland, Raymond R.

Infection severity can range from sub-clinical pulmonary infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 62-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital for acute respiratory failure. Serum samples obtained every week starting from the day of admission showed clear-cut seroconversion for C. pneumoniae antibodies. All other cultures obtained during the first days of hospitalization were negative. Despite maximal ventilatory support (high positive end expiratory pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, nitric oxide inhalation, neuromuscular blocking agents and prone positioning), our patient remained severely hypoxemic, which led us to initiate an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hemodiafiltration were withdrawn on day 12. Our patient was extubated on day 18 and discharged from our Intensive Care Unit on day 20.

CONCLUSION: We describe the first published case of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to C. pneumoniae infection successfully treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a very useful tool in this syndrome.

New tools are needed to distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2\u201314 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, vomiting, leukopenia, platelets \u2264150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared to the entire course of illness. These findings stress the importance of considering day of illness when developing prediction algorithms for real-time clinical management.","publish_time":"2012-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biswas, Hope H.; Ortega, Oscar; Gordon, Aubree; Standish, Katherine; Balmaseda, Angel; Kuan, Guillermina; Harris, Eva","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64a0b8711c7e7553c8025dc56a843ce601fc029b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3295819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3295819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GEE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day of illness","early phase of illness","dengue cases","dengue status","suspected dengue","symptoms","entire course of illness","increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated","natural history of pediatric dengue","frequency of signs","frequency of clinical signs","ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study","association of signs","Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs","positive tourniquet test","children","Multivariable GEE models","real-time clinical management","Odds ratios","Estimated ORs","longitudinal statistical analysis","multi-year","rash","fever","significant associations","myalgia","retro-orbital pain","important differences","arthralgia","petechiae","headache","prediction algorithms","poor capillary refill","generalized estimating equations","cells","cold extremities","repeated measures","leukopenia","confidence intervals","hypotension","Data","Tens of millions","community-based setting","CONCLUSIONS","case definition","disease severity","platelets","METHODS","years","addition","life-threatening complications","BACKGROUND","importance","Managua","Nicaragua","gender","findings","New tools","febrile illnesses","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Strategies to facilitate future clinical trials during outbreaks of unknown or novel pathogens are also presented.","publish_time":"2004-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Matthew P.; McGeer, Allison; Straus, Sharon E.; Hawryluck, Laura; Gold, Wayne L.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca18e923f1cd6532ba1a7f05ca8e2abfa940834a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3322802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzMzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["controlled clinical trials","controlled trials of therapeutic agents","global SARS outbreak","controlled data","randomized controlled trial","future clinical trials","outbreaks of unknown","ribavirin therapy","novel pathogens","recent global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","therapeutic decisions","treatments of uncertain efficacy","unknown infectious pathogen","known toxicity","thousands of patients","researchers","clinicians","logistical challenges","corticosteroids","Strategies","lessons","experience"],"language":"en"},

Assisting during intubation, suctioning before intubation, and manipulating the oxygen mask were high-risk activities. Consistently wearing a mask (either surgical or particulate respirator type N95) while caring for a SARS patient was protective for the nurses, and consistent use of the N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask. Risk was reduced by consistent use of a surgical mask, but not significantly. Risk was lower with consistent use of a N95 mask than with consistent use of a surgical mask.

Despite its importance as a pathogen, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV yet. The attachment glycoprotein (G) of RSV is a potentially important target for protective antiviral immune responses. Recombinant baculovirus has been recently emerged as a new vaccine vector, since it has intrinsic immunostimulatory properties and good bio-safety profile. METHODS: We have constructed a recombinant baculovirus-based RSV vaccine, Bac-RSV/G, displaying G glycoprotein, and evaluated immunogenicity and protective efficacy by intranasal immunization of BALB/c mice with Bac-RSV/G. RESULTS: Bac-RSV/G efficiently provides protective immunity against RSV challenge. Strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses were induced by intranasal immunization with Bac-RSV/G. In addition to humoral immunity, G-specific Th17- as well as Th1-type T-cell responses were detected in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immune mice upon RSV challenge. Neither lung eosinophilia nor vaccine-induced weight loss was observed upon Bac-RSV/G immunization and subsequent RSV infection.

When a traveller returns ill from endemic areas, malaria should be the number one suspect. World Health Organization treatment guidelines recommend that adults with severe malaria should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Severe cases of malaria in patients admitted to an ICU were reviewed retrospectively (1990-2011) and identification of variables associated with in-ICU mortality performed. Malaria prediction score (MPS), malaria score for adults (MSA), simplified acute physiology score (SAPSII) and a score based on WHO\u0027s malaria severe criteria were applied. Statistical analysis was performed using StataV12. RESULTS: Fifty nine patients were included in the study, all but three were adults; 47 (79,6%) were male; parasitaemia on admission, quantified in 48/59 (81.3%) patients, was equal or greater than 2% in 47 of them (97.9%); the most common complications were thrombocytopaenia in 54 (91.5%) patients, associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in seven (11.8%), renal failure in 31 (52.5%) patients, 18 of which (30.5%) oliguric, shock in 29 (49.1%) patients, liver dysfunction in 27 (45.7%) patients, acidaemia in 23 (38.9%) patients, cerebral dysfunction in 22 (37.2%) patients, 11 of whom with unrousable coma, pulmonary oedema/ARDS in 22 (37.2%) patients, hypoglycaemia in 18 (30.5%) patients; 29 (49.1%) patients presented five or more dysfunctions. The case fatality rate was 15.2%. Comparing the four scores, the SAPS II and the WHO score were the most sensitive to death prediction. In the univariate analysis, death was associated with the SAPS II score, cerebral malaria, acute renal and respiratory failure, DIC, spontaneous bleeding, acidosis and hypoglycaemia. Age, partial immunity to malaria, delay in malaria diagnosis and the level of parasitaemia were not associated with death in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Severe malaria cases should be continued monitored in the ICUs. SAPS II and the WHO score are good predictors of mortality in malaria patients, but other specific scores deserve to be studied prospectively.","publish_time":"2012-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santos, Lurdes C; Abreu, C\u00E2ndida F; Xerinda, Sandra M; Tavares, Margarida; Lucas, Raquel; Sarmento, Ant\u00F3nio C","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f3c11512c87541721dd92c09f1593f17639c7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3350412.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","ICU","SAPS II"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["malaria patients","malaria score","diagnosis of malaria","malaria diagnosis","cerebral malaria","Malaria prediction score","Severe cases of malaria","Severe malaria cases","malaria severe criteria","acute physiology score","adults","ICU mortality","death prediction","renal failure","cerebral dysfunction","hypoglycaemia","respiratory failure","level of parasitaemia","specific scores","Statistical analysis","univariate analysis","liver dysfunction","good predictors of mortality","African countries","spontaneous bleeding","delay","MSA","MPS","close relationship of Portugal","World Health Organization treatment guidelines","Portuguese colonies","unrousable coma","partial immunity","pulmonary oedema","ARDS","view","acidosis","disseminated intravascular coagulation","SAPSII","endemic areas","intensive care unit","number","Age","METHODS","CONCLUSION","rare thing","common complications","thrombocytopaenia","case fatality rate","traveller","BACKGROUND","StataV12","male","admission","identification of variables","suspect","study","shock","cohort","RESULTS","acidaemia","dysfunctions","ICUs"],"language":"en"},

Current methods are insufficiently accurate. Plasma proteomic fingerprinting can resolve this difficulty by providing a molecular snapshot defining disease state that can be used to develop point-of-care diagnostics. METHODS: Plasma and clinical data were obtained prospectively from patients attending community TB clinics in Peru and from household contacts. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry. Statistical pattern recognition methods were used to define mass spectral patterns that distinguished patients with active TB from symptomatic controls with or without LTBI. RESULTS: 156 patients with active TB and 110 symptomatic controls (patients with respiratory symptoms without active TB) were investigated. Active TB patients were distinguishable from undifferentiated symptomatic controls with accuracy of 87% (sensitivity 84%, specificity 90%), from symptomatic controls with LTBI (accuracy of 87%, sensitivity 89%, specificity 82%) and from symptomatic controls without LTBI (accuracy 90%, sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%). CONCLUSIONS: We show that active TB can be distinguished accurately from LTBI in symptomatic clinic attenders using a plasma proteomic fingerprint. Translation of biomarkers derived from this study into a robust and affordable point-of-care format will have significant implications for recognition and control of active TB in high prevalence settings.","publish_time":"2012-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sandhu, Gurjinder; Battaglia, Francesca; Ely, Barry K.; Athanasakis, Dimitrios; Montoya, Rosario; Valencia, Teresa; Gilman, Robert H.; Evans, Carlton A.; Friedland, Jon S.; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro; Agranoff, Daniel D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/906902ba01987282a83ec42c2776de9c9bde3834.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3364185.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTBI"],"locations":["Peru"],"keyphrases":["Active TB patients","control of active TB","distinguishing patients","community TB clinics","undifferentiated symptomatic controls","high global prevalence of latent TB infection","accuracy","sensitivity","specificity","symptomatic clinic attenders","co-existing LTBI","Plasma proteomic fingerprinting","high prevalence settings","high-throughput proteomic profiling","Current methods","Statistical pattern recognition methods","overlapping clinical symptoms","respiratory symptoms","endemic settings","clinical data","mass spectrometry","care format","affordable point","care diagnostics","mass spectral patterns","key challenge","Peru","significant implications","study","difficulty","molecular snapshot","household contacts","disease state","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Translation of biomarkers","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

By combining the lipid benefit of PPAR-alpha agonists (such as fibrates) with the glycemic advantages of the PPAR-gamma agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), the dual PPAR agonists approach can both improve the metabolic effects and minimize the side effects caused by either agent alone, and hence has become a promising strategy for designing effective drugs against type-2 diabetes. In this study, by means of the powerful \u201Ccore hopping\u201D and \u201Cglide docking\u201D techniques, a novel class of PPAR dual agonists was discovered based on the compound GW409544, a well-known dual agonist for both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma modified from the farglitazar structure. It was observed by molecular dynamics simulations that these novel agonists not only possessed the same function as GW409544 did in activating PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. It was further validated by the outcomes of their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) predictions that the new agonists hold high potential to become drug candidates. Or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategy or provide useful insights for discovering more effective dual agonists for treating type-2 diabetes. Since the \u201Ccore hopping\u201D technique allows for rapidly screening novel cores to help overcome unwanted properties by generating new lead compounds with improved core properties, it has not escaped our notice that the current strategy along with the corresponding computational procedures can also be utilized to find novel and more effective drugs for treating other illnesses.","publish_time":"2012-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Ying; Wang, Shu-Qing; Xu, Wei-Ren; Wang, Run-Ling; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83447780f68227bd566b75739a926149c96ff3d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3369836.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3369836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPAR-gamma agonists","novel agonists","new agonists","alpha agonists","dual PPAR agonists approach","novel class of PPAR dual agonists","effective dual agonists","activating PPAR-alpha","lipid benefit of PPAR","new strategy","effective drugs","type","diabetes","core hopping","well-known dual agonist","screening novel cores","improved core properties","current strategy","promising strategy","new lead compounds","unwanted properties","cholesterol metabolism","compound GW409544","metabolic effects","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors","PPARs","high potential","glide docking","useful insights","glucose","techniques","excretion","predictions","thiazolidinediones","special attention","glycemic advantages","ADME","absorption","distribution","fibrates","molecular dynamics simulations","corresponding computational procedures","drug candidates","binding","unique functions","favorable conformation","farglitazar structure","outcomes","notice","findings","illnesses","study","agent"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the mechanism of the increased susceptibility of \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice to MHV-A59, we studied organ pathology and the distribution of viral antigen and RNA during acute and chronic infection. A59-infected \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice were more susceptible to acute encephalitis and hepatitis, but did not have increased susceptibility to demyelination. Viral antigen and RNA distribution in the brain was increased in microglia, lymphocytes, and small vessel endothelial cells while the distribution in neurons and glia was similar in \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice and B6 mice. Acute hepatitis and thymus cortical hypoplasia in \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice were delayed in onset but pathologic changes in these organs were similar to those in B6 mice. The low rate of demyelination in \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice was consistent with the low dose of the virus given. A less neurotropic virus MHV-2, caused increased parenchymal inflammation in \u03B2(2)M(-/-) mice, but without demyelination. Thus, CD8\u002B cells were important for viral clearance from endothelial cells, microglia and inflammatory cells, but not from neuronal and glial cells.

We aimed to investigate an association between viral LRTI at \u003C5 years and the development of atopy at \u003E 2 years. METHODS: We conducted a search at Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. We collected data from the included articles. We estimated the odds ratio and the 95% confidence intervals with a random effect model. We determined factors associated with atopy development after childhood LRTI using univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses. We recorded this systematic review at PROSPERO with the number CRD42018116955. RESULTS: We included 24 studies. There was no relationship between viral LRTI at \u003C5 years and skin prick test-diagnosed-atopy (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.7\u20132.0]), unknown diagnosed-atopy (OR = 0.7, [95% CI = 0.4\u20131.3]), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.9\u20131.6]), hyperreactivity to pollen (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3\u20132.7]), food (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3\u20132.5]), or house dust mite (OR = 1.1, [95% CI = 0.6\u20132.2]).

Over the total observation period of 4 winter seasons, 780 children were screened with a nasal swab for the presence of viruses. Of those, 230 (29.5%) had a positive viral culture. The viruses identified were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B virus, parain-fluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and enterovirus. During that time, 83 epidemic events in 47 DCC were recorded. A particular virus was judged to be causally related to an epidemic if the identical virus was isolated in \u2265 3 children during the same outbreak of respiratory diseases. Thus, in 51 cases (61.4%) of all epidemics, the following viruses were responsible for an epidemic: RSV (n = 23), coronavirus (n = 10) (only during the season of 1993-1994), influenza A virus (n = 6), rhinovirus (n = 4), enterovirus (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 3) and parainfluenza virus (n = 1). Except for the somewhat surprising accumulation of coronavirus epidemics during the winter of 1993-1994, there were only minor seasonal variations from one year to another. As expected, RSV accounted for about one third of all respiratory tract infections in children attending DCCs and was therefore the most important single causative agent. These results are compared with data from children who did not attend a DCC and were cared for in a private practice. During the winter of 1989-1990, the viral epidemiological survey was performed at the same time and in parallel to a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study investigating the efficacy of OM-85 BV, an immunoactive bacterial extract. This study, enrolling 423 children attending DCCs demonstrated a protective effect of OM-85 BV in significantly reducing the risk of recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract during the treatment period with the compound. 34% of all participating children (75 in the verum group, 70 in the placebo group) were enrolled in an additional virological study. In these patients, RSV was isolated 10 times in the placebo group, but only 5 times in the treated group (p \u003C 0.05) and influenza A virus was present in 4 children in the placebo group, but only in 1 infant in the verum group giving a total of 14 positive virologie results in the placebo group versus 6 in the verum group (p \u003C 0.05). Despite the small numbers of children investigated for their virologie status during respiratory infectious outbreaks, there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of virus carriers in favor of the children treated with OM-85 BV. These results corroborate the clinical findings.","publish_time":"2009-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aymard, M.; Chomel, J.J.; Allard, J.P.; Thouvenot, D.; Honegger, D.; Floret, D.; Boissel, J.-P.; Collet, J.-P.; D\u00FCrr, F.; Gillet, J.; Bossard, N.; Lyon, L.","journal":"Respiration","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dffc4c34ac1c81eeaee40288b4ee1845b29b373.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCC","RSV"],"locations":["eastern France"],"keyphrases":["placebo group","verum group","participating children","B virus","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","identical virus","particular virus","treated group","small numbers of children","RSV","parain-fluenza virus","prevalence of virus carriers","DCCs","respiratory tract infections","BV","winter seasons","upper respiratory tract","clinical study","respiratory infectious outbreaks","positive virologie results","outbreak of respiratory diseases","times","efficacy of OM","following viruses","rhinovirus","presence of viruses","epidemic events","adenovirus","positive viral culture","enterovirus","Viral investigations","surprising accumulation of coronavirus epidemics","total observation period","protective effect of OM","additional virological study","viral epidemiological survey","virologie status","treatment period","clinical findings","risk of recurrent infections","favor","Rhone D\u00E9partement","significant difference","nasal swab","day-care centers","immunoactive bacterial extract","important single causative agent","minor seasonal variations","year","eastern France","patients","infant","compound","data","private practice","cases"],"language":"en"},

Groups of 100 female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were initiated with four weekly 5 mg gavage doses of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) starting at 50 days of age. After the first weekly DMBA administration, exposure to ambient fields (sham exposed), 50 Hz magnetic fields at either 1 or 5 G field intensity or 60 Hz fields at 1 G for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week was initiated. Exposure continued for 13 weeks. A vehicle control group without DMBA was included. In a second study, using lower doses of DMBA, groups of 100 female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were initiated with four weekly doses of 2 mg of DMBA starting at 50 days of age followed, after the first weekly DMBA administration, by exposure to ambient fields (sham exposed) or 50 Hz magnetic fields at either 1 or 5 G field intensity for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks. Rats were weighed and palpated weekly for the presence of tumors. There was no effect of magnetic field exposure on body weight gains or on the time of appearance of mammary tumors in either study. At the end of 13 weeks, the animals were killed and the mammary tumors counted and measured. Mammary gland masses found grossly were examined histologically.

A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE\u0027s phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 000 times more computationally efficient.

Later, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be the main mediator of this reaction, and Mas was found to be the receptor for the heptapeptide. The functional analysis of this novel axis of the RAS that followed its discovery revealed numerous protective actions in particular for cardiovascular diseases. In parallel, similar protective actions were also described for one of the two receptors of ANG II, the ANG II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R), in contrast to the other, the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), which mediates deleterious actions of this peptide, e.g., in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Very recently, another branch of the RAS was discovered, based on angiotensin peptides in which the amino-terminal aspartate was replaced by alanine, the alatensins. Ala-ANG-(1\u22127) or alamandine was shown to interact with Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D, and the first functional data indicated that this peptide also exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system.

We aimed to evaluate these two factors as potential prognostic factors in critically poisoned patients admitted to our toxicology ICU. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study that was performed on poisoned patients referred to emergency department of Loghman Hakim Hospital. One-hundred critically poisoned patients who had been admitted to ICU were conveniently chosen using a random number table and included into the study after obtaining consent forms from their next of kin. Their serum lactate and CK levels were checked on admission. These levels were compared subsequently between survivors and non-survivors to seek for their potential prognostic role. RESULTS: In a total of 100 patients enrolled, 61 were male. Serum level of lactate (with a cut off of 26 mg/dL) and serum CK with a cutoff point of 169 U/L could have prognosticated death with sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 77% (for lactate) and 74 and 62% (for serum CK), respectively.

The present study studied the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS\u2010coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in SARS patients and evaluated the clinical significance of these antibodies. Methods: Two methods, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay, were used for the detection of the anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV IgG and IgM in 335 serial sera from 98 SARS patients. In 18 patients, serum antibody profiles were investigated and antibody neutralization tests were performed from 7 to 720 days after the onset of symptoms. Results: The ratios of positive IgG/IgM by ELISA were 0/0, 45.4/39.4, 88.6/71.4, 96/88, 100/48.6, 100/30.9, 100/17.1, 100/0 per cent, respectively, on 1\u20137, 8\u201314, 15\u201321, 22\u201328, 29\u201360, 61\u201390, 91\u2013180 and 181\u2013720 days after the onset of symptoms. Antibodies were not detected within the first 7 days of illness, but IgG titre increased dramatically on day 15, reaching a peak on day 60, and remained high until day 180 from when it declined gradually until day 720. IgM was detected on day 15 and rapidly reached a peak, then declined gradually until it was undetectable on day 180. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the convalescence sera from SARS patients. Conclusion: The persistence of detectable IgG antibodies and neutralizing viral antibodies for up to 720 days suggest that SARS patients may be protected from recurrent SARS\u2010CoV infection for up to 2 years.","publish_time":"2006-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"MO, Hongying; ZENG, Guangqiao; REN, Xiaolan; LI, Hui; KE, Changwen; TAN, Yaxia; CAI, Chaoda; LAI, Kefang; CHEN, Rongchang; CHAN\u2010YEUNG, Moira; ZHONG, Nanshan","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6f2d2b465870080ee39199cb6bd5ba940803a25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192223.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","anti\u2010SARS","recurrent SARS","viral antibodies","CoV IgG","persistence of detectable IgG antibodies","IgM","longitudinal profile of antibodies","IgG titre","days of illness","ratios of positive IgG","CoV infection","ELISA","Methods","onset of symptoms","peak","serial sera","convalescence sera","novel coronavirus","serum antibody profiles","antibody neutralization tests","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","indirect immunofluorescent assay","Background","discovered disease","detection","clinical significance","present study","Results","Conclusion","years"],"language":"en"},

These effector leukocytes are equipped with intriguing antimicrobial machinery and consequently display high cytotoxic potential. Accurate neutrophil recruitment is essential to combat microbes and to restore homeostasis, for inflammation modulation and resolution, wound healing and tissue repair. After fulfilling the appropriate effector functions, however, dampening neutrophil activation and infiltration is crucial to prevent damage to the host. In humans, chemoattractant molecules can be categorized into four biochemical families, i.e., chemotactic lipids, formyl peptides, complement anaphylatoxins and chemokines. They are critically involved in the tight regulation of neutrophil bone marrow storage and egress and in spatial and temporal neutrophil trafficking between organs. Chemoattractants function by activating dedicated heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition, emerging evidence suggests an important role for atypical chemoattractant receptors (ACKRs) that do not couple to G proteins in fine-tuning neutrophil migratory and functional responses. The expression levels of chemoattractant receptors are dependent on the level of neutrophil maturation and state of activation, with a pivotal modulatory role for the (inflammatory) environment. Here, we provide an overview of chemoattractant receptors expressed by neutrophils in health and disease. Depending on the (patho)physiological context, specific chemoattractant receptors may be up- or downregulated on distinct neutrophil subsets with beneficial or detrimental consequences, thus opening new windows for the identification of disease biomarkers and potential drug targets.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metzemaekers, Mieke; Gouwy, Mieke; Proost, Paul","journal":"Cell Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a54a37340349b88b776024f9d4dd7bc06e74484.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutrophil activation","atypical chemoattractant receptors","specific chemoattractant receptors","overview of chemoattractant receptors","level of neutrophil maturation","temporal neutrophil trafficking","distinct neutrophil subsets","Accurate neutrophil recruitment","expression levels of chemoattractant receptors","chemoattractant molecules","tight regulation of neutrophil bone marrow storage","Neutrophils","important role","G proteins","state of activation","effector leukocytes","identification of disease biomarkers","pivotal modulatory role","high cytotoxic potential","potential drug targets","appropriate effector functions","dedicated heptahelical G protein","resolution","egress","detrimental consequences","wound healing","intriguing antimicrobial machinery","chemotactic lipids","new windows","formyl peptides","inflammation modulation","frontline cells","physiological context","emerging evidence","Chemoattractants function","functional responses","innate immune system","anaphylatoxins","homeostasis","tissue repair","patho","microbes","organs","infiltration","ACKRs","health","biochemical families","damage","chemokines","addition","GPCRs","host"],"language":"en"},

The life cycle of Vairimorpha necatrix was studied by electron microscopy. Disporous development has two distinct stages: 1) diplokaryotic meronts which are actively mitotic, and 2) diplokaryotic sporonts which are distinguished by reduced ribosome density and a thickened plasmalemma. After final division of the sporont, sporoblasts form spores which are ovocylindrical and measure 4.4 \u00B1 0.08 \u00D7 2.3 \u00B1 0.05 \u03BCm (mean \u00B1 SE). Octosporous development results in eight haploid spores being formed in a sporophorous vesicle. The uninucleate octospores were smaller than the binucleate dispores and the exospore was thicker but less crenulate in outline. Early in octosporogony, tubules are produced from the sporont plasmalemma and electron\u2010dense material accumulates in the episporontal space. The latter may be amorphous, vesiculated, or vacuolated in appearance and in later stages may take a stacked, lamellar form.

ARDS patients with low-flow Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal, especially pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist, have also a high mortality rate, but there are no validated specific or general outcome scores. This retrospective study tested whether these established specific risk scores can be validated for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist in ARDS patients in comparison to a general organ dysfunction score, the SOFA score. METHODS: In a retrospective single center cohort study we calculated and evaluated RESP, PRESERVE, and SOFA score for 73 ARDS patients with pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist treated between 2002 and 2016 using the XENIOS iLA Membrane Ventilator. Six patients had a mild, 40 a moderate and 27 a severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. Demographic data and hospital mortality as well as ventilator settings, hemodynamic parameters, and blood gas measurement before and during extracorporeal therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist of mechanical ventilated ARDS patients resulted in an optimized lung protective ventilation, significant reduction of P(aCO2), and compensation of acidosis. Scoring showed a mean score of alive versus deceased patients of 3 \u00B1 1 versus \u2212 1 \u00B1 1 for RESP (p \u003C 0.01), 3 \u00B1 0 versus 6 \u00B1 0 for PRESERVE (p \u003C 0.05) and 8 \u00B1 1 versus 10 \u00B1 1 for SOFA (p \u003C 0.05). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67\u20130.89, p \u003C 0.01) for RESP score, 0.80 (95% CI 0.70\u20130.90, p \u003C 0.0001) for PRESERVE score and 0.66 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.79, p \u003C 0.05) for SOFA score. CONCLUSIONS: RESP and PRESERVE scores were superior to SOFA, as non-specific critical care score. Although scores were developed for veno-venous ECMO, we could validate RESP and PRESERVE score for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist. In conclusion, RESP and PRESERVE score are suitable to estimate mortality risk of ARDS patients with an arterio-venous pumpless Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petran, Jan; Muelly, Thorsten; Dembinski, Rolf; Steuer, Niklas; Arens, Jutta; Marx, Gernot; Kopp, Ruedger","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84d22b71f6df277a11824433ccf14137303f55f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RESP","ARDS","XENIOS iLA Membrane Ventilator","CI","Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal"],"locations":["Berlin"],"keyphrases":["RESP score","SOFA score","PRESERVE scores","Pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist of mechanical ventilated ARDS patients","mortality risk of ARDS patients","extracorporeal therapy","mean score of alive","severe ARDS","deceased patients","general organ dysfunction score","evaluated RESP","non-specific critical care score","arterio-venous pumpless Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal","veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","significant reduction of P","low-flow Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal","individual mortality risk","hospital mortality","established specific risk scores","general outcome scores","optimized lung protective ventilation","veno-venous ECMO","retrospective study","high mortality rate","ventilator settings","XENIOS iLA Membrane Ventilator","retrospective single center cohort study","comparison","hemodynamic parameters","blood gas measurement","area","aCO2","characteristic curves","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","receiver","METHODS","Demographic data","Scoring","Berlin criteria","CONCLUSIONS","compensation of acidosis","AUC","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean (\u00B1 sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 \u00B1 10.2 \u03BCg/ml present at 30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 \u00B1 0.8 \u03BCg/ml. From the pharmacological analysis of concentration\u2010time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the im injection site, with an absorption half\u2010time of 0.16 \u00B1 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7 \u00B1 26.9 per cent). A peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug. At 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. Based on the MIC values of the majority of isolates of Corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 \u03BCg neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/kg) to be therapeutically effective.","publish_time":"2010-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"BAGGOT, J.

Methods and Results: A bench scale alkaline stabilization model was used to evaluate the inactivation of MS2 seeded into raw sludge simultaneously with HM\u2010175 or T1 L. Stabilization was performed in triplicate at 28 and 4\u00B0C for both viral combinations. During stabilization at 28 and 4\u00B0C, MS2 and T1 L concentrations were similar at each time point (t = 0\u00B71, 2, 12 and 24 h). MS2 and HM\u2010175 concentrations were also similar at each time point during stabilization at 28\u00B0C. At 4\u00B0C, MS2 and HM\u2010175 concentrations were not similar at the first two time points (t = 0\u00B71 and 2 h), but were similar at later time points (t = 12 and 24 h). Conclusions: The inactivation rates of T1 L at 4\u00B0C and both T1 L and HM\u2010175 at 28\u00B0C were similar to the inactivation rate of MS2 at all time points. At 4\u00B0C, MS2 was inactivated at a faster rate during the first two time points (t = 0\u00B71 and 2 h) than HM\u2010175, but was inactivated similarly at later time points (t = 12 and 24 h). Significance and Impact of the Study: Phages, such as MS2, would be ideal indicators for the presence of enteric viruses in wastewater residues because of their ubiquity, nonpathogenic nature, low cost and time associated with their detection. The findings of this study suggest that MS2 could serve as an indicator for monitoring the persistence of enteric viruses, such as HM\u2010175 and T1 L, during alkaline stabilization performed at moderate temperatures (28\u00B0C), but may not serve as an indicator for HM\u2010175 at reduced temperature (4\u00B0C).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the principal etiologic agent of SARS. We analyzed serum samples obtained from 623 patients with SARS in Beijing, to determine whether infection with SARS-CoV can elicit neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Methods. We developed a highly sensitive and safe neutralization assay using the SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus and used this assay to determine the titers of the NAbs in serum samples from patients with SARS. Results. We found that 85.9% of serum samples contained NAbs against SARS-CoV and that most of the NAb activities could be attributed to immunoglobulin G. The NAbs became detectable first at 5\u201310 days after the onset of symptoms, and their levels peaked at 20\u201330 days and then were sustained for \u003E150 days. The serum samples could neutralize the pseudotype particles bearing the spike glycoproteins from different SARS-CoV strains, suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV were broadly reactive. Conclusions. NAbs to SARS-CoV are broadly elicited in patients with SARS and, according to their kinetics, may correlate with viral load during the early stages of the disease. These results suggest that it is possible to develop effective vaccines against SARS and that NAbs provide a potential strategy for treating patients with SARS.","publish_time":"2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuchun, Nie; Guangwen, Wang; Xuanling, Shi; Hong, Zhang; Yan, Qiu; Zhongping, He; Wei, Wang; Gewei, Lian; Xiaolei, Yin; Liying, Du; Lili, Ren; Jianwei, Wang; Xiong, He; Taisheng, Li; Hongkui, Deng; Mingxiao, Ding","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/248b06ce676930fab962e447e74a30c809c07fd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

This paper aims to summarize typical presentations of common international diseases and provide the emergency physician with a practical approach based on current guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: In the treatment of traveler\u2019s diarrhea, azithromycin has become the treatment of choice due to the growing antibiotic resistance. Intravenous artesunate was approved in 2019 under investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of severe malaria, and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have become the first-line treatment for most cases of uncomplicated malaria. Since the 2015 outbreak, Zika has become a concern to many travelers, but the current treatment is supportive. SUMMARY: Clinicians should be aware of a few noteworthy updates in the treatment of internationally acquired illnesses, but more importantly, they must recognize warning signs of severe illness and treat promptly.

Control of IB is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. Although serotyping requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV, and it is inefficient at detecting multiple viruses in a single sample. We describe herein a MinION-based, amplicon-based sequencing (AmpSeq) method that genetically categorized IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple IBVs. Total RNA was extracted from 15 tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer\u2019s instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and then sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in 3 of 5 samples containing 2 IBV lineages. Additionally, 1 sample contained 3 IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected 2 of the 3 lineages. Strain identification, including detection of different IBVs from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butt, Salman L.; Erwood, Eric C.; Zhang, Jian; Sellers, Holly S.; Young, Kelsey; Lahmers, Kevin K.; Stanton, James B.","journal":"J Vet Diagn Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5155d7928021cdc7f122c31efe9c03901bf217f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["IB","IBV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV lineages","IBV-positive samples","categorized IBV","cultured IBV","clinical samples","pooling of samples","AmpSeq method","MinION-based AmpSeq","oral swab samples","choanal cleft swab samples","multiple IBVs","amplicon-based sequencing","D MinION sequencing library","S1 subunit","universal S1 PCR","Sanger sequencing","infectious bronchitis virus","detection of different IBVs","accurate identification","Strain identification","modified S1-targeted primers","multiple viruses","Control of IB","single sample","significant economic losses","causative agent","tracheal scrapings","genotyping","efficient means","manufacturer\u2019s instructions","global poultry industry","immunologic characterization","genetic diversity","serotypes","complete serologic cross-protection","feasibility","spike gene","serotyping","Total RNA","emergence","results","Amplicons"],"language":"en"},

The results of a survey of the macro\u2010invertebrates of the polluted River Ely, South Wales, are used as a basis for comparing several classification methods which have been used previously in river survey work to determine species groupings.

The species groupings determined by these methods were influenced both by the association coefficient and the technique used to cluster it. Some species were grouped together by all or most of the methods. The ecological validity of these robust groups is examined. A clear recommendation regarding the most appropriate method is frustrated by incomplete knowledge of the ecological requirements of most of the aquatic macro\u2010invertebrates used in the data\u2010set. However, Kendall\u0027s tau coefficient clustered by the average linkage technique appeared to produce ecologically meaningful species groups.

When tracheostomy weaning commences, it is often debated whether the methods used facilitate swallowing recovery. We conducted a systematic review to determine whether tracheostomy modifications alter swallowing physiology in adults. We searched eight electronic databases, nine grey literature repositories and conducted handsearching. We included studies that reported on oropharyngeal dysphagia as identified by instrumentation in adults with a tracheostomy. We accepted case series (n \u003E 10), prospective or retrospective observational studies, and randomized control trials. We excluded patients with head and neck cancer and/or neurodegenerative disease. Two independent and blinded reviewers rated abstracts and articles for study inclusion. Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment was conducted on included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. A total of 7079 citations were identified, of which, 639 articles were reviewed, with ten articles meeting our inclusion criteria.

METHODS: This paper used vector autoregressive model to combine the number of newly diagnosed cases with Baidu search index to predict monthly newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea in China. The procedures included: (1) keywords selection and filtering; (2) construction of composite search index; (3) modelling with training data from January 2011 to October 2016 and calculating the prediction performance with validation data from November 2016 to October 2017. RESULTS: The analysis showed that there was a close correlation between the monthly number of newly diagnosed cases and the composite search index (the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients were 0.777 for HIV/AIDS, 0.590 for syphilis and 0.633 for gonorrhoea, p\u003C0.05 for all). The R(2) were all more than 85% and the mean absolute percentage errors were less than 11%, showing the good fitting effect and prediction performance of vector autoregressive model in this field. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated the potential feasibility of using Baidu search data to monitor and predict the number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea in China.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Ruonan; Luo, Ganfeng; Duan, Qibin; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Qingpeng; Tang, Weiming; Smith, M.

A unique genomic difference between human and civet severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) is that the former has a deletion of 29 nucleotides from open reading frame (orf) 8d that results in the generation of orf8a and orf8b. The objectives of the present study were to analyze antibody reactivity to ORF8a in patients with SARS and to elucidate the function of ORF8a. Methods. Western-blot and immunofluorescent antibody assays were used to detect anti-ORF8a antibody. SARS-CoV HKU39849 was used to infect stable clones expressing ORF8a and cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA). The virus loads (VLs) and cytopathic effects (CPEs) were recorded. Confocal microscopy and several mitochondria-related tests were used to study the function of ORF8a. Results. Two (5.4%) of 37 patients with SARS had anti-ORF8a antibodies. The VLs in the stable clones expressing ORF8a were significantly higher than those in control subjects 5 days after infection. siRNA against orf8a significantly reduced VLs and interrupted the CPE. ORF8a was found to be localized in mitochondria, and overexpression resulted in increases in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, caspase 3 activity, and cellular apoptosis. Conclusions. ORF8a not only enhances viral replication but also induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chia-Yen; Ping, Yueh-Hsin; Lee, Hsin-Chen; Chen, Kuan-Hsuan; Lee, Yuan-Ming; Chan, Yu-Juin; Lien, Te-Cheng; Jap, Tjin-Shing; Lin, Chi-Hung; Kao, Lung-Sen; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec94cfc15d3eb626d9ce7f9e8251e8aece944fb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of ORF8a","generation of orf8a","anti-ORF8a antibody","anti-ORF8a antibodies","SARS-CoVs","antibody reactivity","stable clones","reduced VLs","SARS-CoV HKU39849","patients","siRNA","Results","immunofluorescent antibody assays","mitochondria-related tests","mitochondria-dependent pathway","cellular apoptosis","present study","civet severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses","reactive oxygen species production","mitochondrial transmembrane potential","caspase","increases","cells","open reading frame","nucleotides","unique genomic difference","small interfering RNA","cytopathic effects","control subjects","Western-blot","overexpression","Confocal microscopy","virus loads","days","infection","deletion","CPEs","viral replication","objectives","orf8b","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Choosing between immediate ETI or NIV trial is often difficult when such patients present with an altered mental status. Some guidelines recommend avoiding NIV when consciousness is impaired given the risk of aspiration, and some authors suggest that a pH \u003C 7.25 is highly predictive of NIV failure. Though clinical response to a well-adjusted NIV treatment can be both swift and spectacular, these contraindications probably encourage physicians to proceed to immediate ETI. Some studies indeed report that NIV was not even considered in as many as 60% of patients who might have benefited from this therapy, though ETI related complications might have been avoided had NIV been successfully applied. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of ARF in COPD patients who were successfully treated by NIV in prehospital setting and avoided ETI despite contraindications (altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale \u003C 8) and failure risk factors (severe respiratory acidosis with pH \u003C 7.25).

It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed.

The genes responsible for many of these diseases have also been identified. Recent advances in diagnostic procedures have enabled these to be identified earlier and appropriately treated. While a number of approaches are available to identify mutations, direct sequencing remains the gold standard. This approach identifies the exact genetic change with substantial precision. We suggest that a sensitive and economical approach to mutation detection could be the direct sequencing of cDNA followed by the confirmatory sequencing of the corresponding exon. While screening techniques such as single\u2010stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis (HA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and denaturing high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) have proven useful, each has inherent advantages and disadvantages.

Such tests have led to the discovery of significant influences of age, gender, smoking, toxic exposure, and genetics on the ability to smell.

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study, without intervention. SETTING: Two sites of a senior daycare program providing all\u2010inclusive care for the older persons in Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Staff members and participants of the daycare. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, medical, and physical findings were collected from older subjects at baseline and while ill with respiratory illnesses. Nasopharyngeal specimens for viral and Chlamydia culture and sputum for bacterial culture were obtained from subjects when ill. Acute and convalescent sera were also collected with each illness and examined for viral, chlamydial, and mycoplasma infection. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty\u2010five illnesses were documented in 165 older daycare participants as well as 113 illnesses among 67 staff members during the 15\u2010month study. The rate of ARTI in the elderly group was 10.8 per 100 person months. The most common etiologies in both the staff and elderly participants were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, and coronavirus. The etiologies of illnesses in the staff compared with those in elderly group were similar except that bacterial infections were significantly more common among the elderly (7% vs. 0, P = 0.05). Multiple pathogens were found to cocirculate within centers, and no clear outbreak of a predominant organism was noted. Cough and nasal congestion characterized most illnesses. The elderly experienced significantly more cough, dyspnea, and sputum production than did the staff. There were 10 hospitalizations related to respiratory infections and four deaths during the acute illness among the elderly group and none in staff. CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory infections are a common occurrence in both the staff and participants of a senior daycare center and are the cause of substantial morbidity in frail older persons.","publish_time":"2015-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falsey, Ann R.; McCann, Robert M.; Hall, William J.; Tanner, Martin A.; Criddle, Mary M.; Formica, Maria A.; Irvine, Carrie S.; Kolassa, John E.; Barker, William H.; Treanor, John J.","journal":"J Am Geriatr Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f22cdb0aad1ba0b57e3daca457a16c8eb470a24e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166334.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166334/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["elderly participants","older daycare participants","respiratory illnesses","elderly group","Staff members","Acute respiratory infections","acute respiratory tract infections","older subjects","etiologies of illnesses","frail older persons","bacterial infections","acute illness","senior daycare program","senior daycare center","common etiologies","respiratory syncytial virus","bacterial culture","rate of ARTI","Cough","common occurrence","rate of specific pathogens","Chlamydia culture","sputum production","Multiple pathogens","month study","Prospective descriptive study","clinical syndromes","all\u2010inclusive care","cause of substantial morbidity","physical findings","Rochester","dyspnea","RSV","baseline","clear outbreak","Demographic","Influenza","cocirculate","centers","Nasopharyngeal specimens","sites","New York","deaths","predominant organism","DESIGN","intervention","mycoplasma infection","nasal congestion","CONCLUSIONS","convalescent sera","person months","MEASUREMENTS","SETTING","MAIN RESULTS","hospitalizations","coronavirus","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the aims of the present study were to compare the efficacy and safety of IFN\u2010\u03B1 alone or in combination with amantadine sulphate in nonresponders to previous IFN\u2010\u03B1 monotherapy. Fifty\u2010five IFN\u2010\u03B1 nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C (mean age: 46.6 years) received IFN\u2010\u03B1 6 MIU thrice weekly for 24 weeks followed by 3 MIU thrice weekly for additional 24 weeks. Amantadine sulphate (n=26) or a matched placebo (n=29) was given orally twice daily for 48 weeks. Because of a low initial response rate at week 12 (13/55 patients) and a high breakthrough rate (8/13 patients) after IFN\u2010\u03B1 dose reduction in week 24, a virological end\u2010of\u2010treatment response with undetectable serum HCV\u2010RNA (\u003C 1000 copies/mL) was achieved in only five patients (IFN\u2010\u03B1/amantadine sulphate, one patient; IFN\u2010\u03B1/placebo, four patients).

Nasal brush samples were obtained from 14 infants with RSV bronchiolitis and from 8 infants with RSV upper respiratory tract infection. The samples were taken during infection (acute phase) and 2\u20134 weeks later (convalescent phase). Cytospin preparations were stained immunohistochemically for T cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. Staining also took place for intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101), T\u2010helper 1 (Th1)\u2010like (interleukin\u201012 [IL\u201012], interferon\u2010\u03B3 [IFN\u2010\u03B3]), Th2\u2010like (IL\u20104, IL\u201010), and proinflammatory cytokines (IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201018). During both RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infection, cellular inflammation was observed. This was characterised by an increase in the numbers of nasal macrophages, which tended to be higher in bronchiolitis than in upper respiratory tract infection. Numbers of T lymphocytes and ICAM\u20101 positive cells increased during both bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no differences between numbers in the groups. Interestingly, a distinct nasal proinflammatory cytokine response was observed in RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis. This is characterised by an increase in the number of IL\u201018 positive cells. This increase is specific for bronchiolitis, as a similar increase could not be detected in RSV\u2010induced upper respiratory tract infection. Numbers of IL\u20106 and IL\u201012 positive cells were higher in both bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infection, and there were no differences between the groups. By contrast, the number of IL\u20108, IFN\u2010\u03B3, IL\u20104, and IL\u201010\u2010positive cells remained constant. In conclusion, clear differences were found in nasal immune responses of children with RSV\u2010induced upper respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis. The induction of a strong IL\u201018 response was typical for bronchiolitis, as this could not be observed in RSV\u2010induced upper respiratory tract infection, and could explain the eosinophilia that is observed frequently during bronchiolitis.

Cross\u2010reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired\u2010sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti\u2010SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibody against SARS\u2010CoV was observed in all patients. Surprisingly, with the use of ELISA for HTLV, sera for 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). Western blot for HTLV on those 26 paired\u2010sera from 13 HTLV\u2010positive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV\u2010I, 7 positive results for HTLV\u2010II, 1 positive result for both HTLV\u2010I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV\u2010I or HTLV\u2010II, and 4 \u201Cindeterminate\u201D results.

In this study, a TaqMan reverse transcription (RT)\u2010polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for rapid detection and quantification of the viral RNA of various JEV strains. A consensus JEV NS3 region was chosen to design the primers and the TaqMan probe. The JEV TaqMan assay used the EZ\u2010rTtH RT\u2010PCR system featuring advantages such as a one\u2010step, high\u2010temperature RT reaction modality and preventing carry\u2010over contamination. The sensitivity of the JEV TaqMan assay for detecting in vitro\u2010transcribed JEV NS3 RNA was estimated to be one to five copies of RNA per reaction. For cultured JE virions, less than 40 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml of virus load (corresponding to 0.07 PFU/test) could be detected. In addition, the JEV TaqMan assay could detect all seven strains of JEV tested, but provided negative results for nine other flaviviruses and encephalitis viruses tested. The JEV TaqMan assay demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional RT\u2010PCR methods as has been previously reported. The application of the JEV TaqMan assay herein has been shown to the sensitive detection of the JEV from both mosquito pools and also JEV\u2010spiking human blood. The assay should be of use in diagnostic laboratory conduct and could be used to replace or complement time\u2010consuming viral\u2010culture methods, thus achieving more rapid, sensitive, and highly specific identification of JEV infection.

Detection of residual HCV in individuals with SVR after treatment of CHC can be significantly heightened by analyzing ex vivo mitogen\u2010activated T and B lymphocytes and applying sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays. However, it remained unknown if synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes would further augment HCV detection, if viral replication becomes universally upregulated in treated cells, and if examining sequential sera and lymphoid cells would improve detection of occult infection. Using paired sera and lymphoid cells collected 1 year apart from 17 individuals with normal liver enzymes for up to 72 months after SVR, it was found that simultaneous activation of lymphocytes and monocytes enhanced identification of silent HCV infection and revealed that in some cases monocytes were the principal immune cell type where HCV persisted. Testing of serial samples further increased detection of occult infection. Ultimately, by combining the above two approaches, all individuals with SVR were found to be silent carriers of HCV. Clonal sequencing revealed HCV variations in sera and lymphoid cells and evolution of viral genomes confirming ongoing virus replication. Surprisingly, similar to those with CHC, naive lymphoid cells from some individuals carried \u223C10(3) HCV copies/\u03BCg total RNA. HCV loads in naive lymphoid cells predetermined the outcome of ex vivo stimulation with respect to upregulation or inhibition of HCV replication. HCV RNA levels in occult infection were inversely proportional to the expression of IFN\u03B1 and IFN\u2010inducible MxA, but not to IFN\u03B3 or tumour necrosis factor \u03B1 in naive and mitogen\u2010treated lymphoid cells.","publish_time":"2007-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, T.

In this review, we discuss the role of chemokines in host\u2010defense against virus infections, and we also look deeper into the virus\u2010cell interactions that trigger chemokine expression as well as the cellular signaling cascades involved.","publish_time":"2003-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melchjorsen, Jesper; S\u00F8rensen, Louise N.; Paludan, S\u00F8ren R.","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/646b45e9f90b7e76a848e3d7da0d7ff405f7ad2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166880.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166880/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chemokines"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infections","viral subversion","control of viral infections","chemokine system","profile of chemokine expression","role of chemokines","host","activation of leukocytes","elimination of microbes","essential mediators of inflammation","immune response","defense","group of bioactive peptides","leukocyte migration","viruses","cell interactions","antiviral activities","Recruitment","infected areas","cascades","review","cells"],"language":"en"},

The airway epithelium has an important role in host defense against infection and this is illustrated in this review by considering infection by respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory viruses are a common trigger of exacerbations. Rhinoviruses (RV) are the most common virus type detected. Knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of such RV\u2010induced exacerbations remains limited, but information is available from in vitro and from in vivo studies, especially of experimental infection in human volunteers. RV infects and replicates within epithelial cells (EC) of the lower respiratory tract. EC are an important component of the innate\u2010immune response to RV infection. The interaction between virus and the intracellular signaling pathways of the host cell results in activation of potentially antiviral mechanisms, including type 1 interferons and nitric oxide, and in the producton of cytokines and chemokines [interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03B2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201011, IL\u201016, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1, granulocyte macrophage\u2010colony stimulating factor, growth\u2010regulated oncogene\u2010\u03B1, epithelial neutrophil\u2010activating protein\u201078, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted, eotaxin 1/2, macrophage\u2010inflammatory protein\u20101\u03B1], which influence the subsequent induced innate\u2010 and specific\u2010immune response. Although this is beneficial in facilitating clearance of virus from the respiratory tract, the generation of proinflammatory mediators and the recruitment of inflammatory cells result in a degree of immunopathology and may amplify pre\u2010existing airway inflammation. Further research will be necessary to determine whether modification of EC responses to respiratory virus infection will be of therapeutic benefit.","publish_time":"2003-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eecc1abca3d4b25fe067412d02362d60508d563.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infection","respiratory virus infection","RV infection","respiratory viruses","experimental infection","lower respiratory tract","common virus type","epithelial cells","activation","facilitating clearance of virus","immune response","induced exacerbations","inflammatory protein","common trigger of exacerbations","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","recruitment of inflammatory cells","modification of EC responses","granulocyte macrophage","important role","important component","host defense","epithelial neutrophil","regulated oncogene","airway epithelium","host cell results","pre\u2010existing airway inflammation","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","colony","eotaxin","growth","generation of proinflammatory mediators","antiviral mechanisms","asthma","interferons","interleukin","pathways","producton of cytokines","degree of immunopathology","major cause of morbidity","patients","nitric oxide","normal T","information","chemokines","immunopathogenesis","replicates","therapeutic benefit","mortality","studies","human volunteers","review","Knowledge","interaction","research","Rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

Our intention is to give an actual account of the knowledge accumulated on this subject, as it has been obtained predominantly by means of the magnetic after\u2010effect (MAE) spectroscopy. After a concise introduction into the theoretical and experimental fundamentals of this technique, the main concern is focused on the presentation and detailed discussion of the MAE spectra arising \u2014 after low\u2010temperature electron (e(\u2013))\u2010 or neutron(n)\u2010irradiation and subsequent annealing \u2014 in: (i) high\u2010purity \u03B1\u2010Fe and \u03B1\u2010Fe doped with (ii) substitutional solutes (like Ni, V, Al, Cu, Ti, Be, Si, Mn, \u2026) or (iii) interstitial solutes (like O, H, C, N). During the course of systematic annealing treatments, these respective spectra undergo dramatic variations at specific temperatures thereby revealing in great detail the underlying intrinsic reactions of the radiation\u2010induced defects, i.e., reorientation, migration, clustering, dissolution and finally annihilation. In alloyed Fe systems the corresponding reaction sequences are even multiplied due to additional interactions between defects and solute atoms. Most valuable information concerning formation\u2010, dissociation\u2010 and binding enthalpies of small, mixed clusters (of the type C(i)V(k), N(i)V(k); i, k \u2265 1) has been obtained in high\u2010purity \u03B1\u2010Fe base material which, after charging with C or N, had been e(\u2013)\u2010irradiated. Concerning the basic recovery mechanisms in \u03B1\u2010Fe, two complementary results are obtained from the analysis of the various systems: (i) in high\u2010purity and substitutionally alloyed \u03B1\u2010Fe the recovery in Stage\u2010III (200 K) is governed by a three\u2010dimensionally migrating (H (M) (I) = 0.56 eV) stable interstitial (dumb\u2010bell); (ii) following the formation and dissociation kinetics of small clusters (C(1)V(k), N(1)V(k)) in interstitially alloyed \u03B1\u2010Fe the migration enthalpy of the monovacancy must hold the following relation H (M) (N) (0.76 eV) \u003C H (M) (C) (0.84 eV) \u003C H (M) (V1). These results are in clear agreement with the so\u2010called two\u2010interstitial model (2IM) in \u03B1\u2010Fe \u2013 a conclusion being further substantiated by a systematic comparison with the results obtained from nonrelaxational techniques, like i.e. positron annihilation (PA), which by their authors are preferentially interpreted in terms of the one\u2010interstitial model (1IM).","publish_time":"2000-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blythe, H.J.; Kronm\u00FCller, H.; Seeger, A.; Walz, F.","journal":"Physica Status Solidi A Appl Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd0283a74bd15c8b481ce8dc2d72d699cdcc7c86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alloyed \u03B1","purity \u03B1","alloyed Fe systems","Fe base material","interstitial model","type C","interstitial solutes","following relation H","stable interstitial","MAE spectra","complementary results","dissociation kinetics of small clusters","respective spectra","mixed clusters","induced defects","migration enthalpy","course of systematic annealing treatments","systematic comparison","subsequent annealing","positron annihilation","various systems","substitutional solutes","point defect reactions","underlying intrinsic reactions","binding enthalpies of small","basic recovery mechanisms","decades","monovacancy","iron","specific temperatures","dramatic variations","corresponding reaction sequences","experimental fundamentals","presentation","reorientation","intensive studies","additional interactions","nonrelaxational techniques","comprehensive survey","solute atoms","clustering","dissolution","detailed discussion","analysis","irradiation","concise introduction","main concern","temperature electron","clear agreement","knowledge","actual account","review","magnetic after\u2010effect","spectroscopy","bell","valuable information","terms","conclusion","Stage","diluted alloys","intention","authors","Mn","neutron","subject","V1"],"language":"en"},

The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV). The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described. Moreover, the viral genome of SARS\u2010CoV has been fully sequenced. However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS\u2010CoV are limited. In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS\u2010CoV using an in\u2010situ hybridization (ISH) technique. Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel. Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescence\u2013fluorescence in\u2010situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS\u2010CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection. Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.

We show here that the hysteresis loop can be reproduced in epidemic models provided that the infectious rate is adiabatically increased or decreased before the system reaches its stationary state. Two ways to the hysteresis loop are revealed, which is helpful in understanding the mechanics of infections in real evolution.

Spatial networks are, however, extremely relevant in our daily lives, and a large body of research exists to show that the distances between nodes greatly influence the cost and probability of establishing and maintaining a link. A random geometric graph (RGG) is the main type of synthetic network model used to mimic the statistical properties and behavior of many social networks. We propose a model, called REDS, that extends energy-constrained RGGs to account for the synergic effect of sharing the cost of a link with our neighbors, as is observed in real relational networks. We apply both the standard Watts-Strogatz rewiring procedure and another method that conserves the degree distribution of the network. The second technique was developed to eliminate unwanted forms of spatial correlation between the degree of nodes that are affected by rewiring, limiting the effect on other properties such as clustering and assortativity. We analyze both the statistical properties of these two network types and their epidemiological behavior when used as a substrate for a standard susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model. We consider and discuss the differences in properties and behavior between RGGs and REDS as rewiring increases and as infection parameters are changed. We report considerable differences both between the network types and, in the case of REDS, between the two rewiring schemes. We conclude that REDS represent, with the application of these rewiring mechanisms, extremely useful and interesting tools in the study of social and epidemiological phenomena in synthetic complex networks.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iotti, Bryan; Antonioni, Alberto; Bullock, Seth; Darabos, Christian; Tomassini, Marco; Giacobini, Mario","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ba44e8b11efcaa96ef3f04364e6dd623e839768.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["REDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Spatial networks","particular of social networks","synthetic complex networks","study of complex networks","real relational networks","network types","statistical properties","rewiring mechanisms","rewiring increases","rewiring schemes","epidemiological behavior","study of social","degree of nodes","case of REDS","main type of synthetic network model","susceptible compartmental model","cost","link","standard susceptible-infected","epidemiological phenomena","synergic effect","degree distribution","considerable differences","energy-constrained RGGs","standard Watts-Strogatz","unwanted forms of spatial correlation","interesting tools","account","substrate","daily lives","procedure","method","large body of research","infection parameters","random geometric graph","neighbors","distances","probability","application","technique","assortativity"],"language":"en"},

Our results show that, for [Formula: see text] , an abundance of hubs drive MOTs, even if a synergistic spreading event requires an arbitrarily large number of adjacent spreaders.

The affected individual regresses and is unable to self-care and quite characteristically will resist rehabilitation, worsen with praise or remain entirely passive. This systematic review was aimed at describing clinical features of PRS, current interventions and to summarise some of the nosological aspects of the condition. Without language restriction, an electronic search was conducted in Embase, PsychInfo, Medline, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases yielding 29 articles with a total of 79 cases. We performed a risk of assessment bias using an adapted Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 124 articles were identified, of which 29 were included and these yielded 79 cases. Seventy-six percent of the studies had a low rate of risk of assessment bias (good quality). Our results show that PRS overlaps with several conditions, mainly affects young females aged 7\u201315 years and has a recovery rate of 78% if diagnosed and treated early but the duration of inpatient treatment may last up to 9.44 months (8.82 SD). The patients had multiple inter-dependent risks. The major predisposing factors included vulnerable premorbid personality and pre-existing mental disorder. Precipitating factors were stressors such as infection and traumatic experiences. Enmeshed parent\u2013child relationship served as a maintaining factor. The themes of treatment approach are essentially rehabilitative: (1) working collaboratively with patient and family, (2) having access to multidisciplinary team, and (3) peer/group supervision. This study has systematically evaluated a large sample of patients with PRS to ascertain its clinical features and the core elements of its treatment. Its key treatment approach is a multi-modal rehabilitative strategy that is compassionate, transparent and inclusive.

Since non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental pathogens, the vicinity favouring host-pathogen interactions is known as important predisposing factor for PNTM. The ongoing changes in world population, as well as socio-political and economic factors, are linked to the rise in the incidence of PNTM. Development is an important factor for the improvement of population well-being, but it has also been linked, in general, to detrimental environmental consequences, including the rise of emergent (usually neglected) infectious diseases, such as PNTM. The rise of neglected PNTM infections requires the expansion of the current efforts on the development of diagnostics, therapies and vaccines for mycobacterial diseases, which at present, are mainly focused on TB.

METHODS: Analysis of four studies carried out at 6-year intervals over an 18-year period. The studies included 26,024 patients (5183 in 1998, 4968 in 2004, 8108 in 2010, and 7765 in 2016) admitted to 1253 units from 38 countries. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We performed analyses using multilevel logistic modeling with mixed-random effects, including country as a random variable. To evaluate the effect of management strategies on mortality, a mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Adjusted 28-day mortality decreased significantly over time (first study as reference): 2004: odds ratio 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72\u20130.93); 2010: 0.63 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.75); 2016: 0.49 (95% CI 0.39\u20130.61). A protective ventilatory strategy and the use of continuous sedation mediated a moderate fraction of the effect of time on mortality in patients with moderate hypoxemia and without hypoxemia, respectively. Logistic multilevel modeling showed a significant effect of country on mortality: median odds ratio (MOR) in 1998: 2.02 (95% CI 1.57\u20132.48); in 2004: 1.76 (95% CI 1.47\u20132.06); in 2010: 1.55 (95% CI 1.37\u20131.74), and in 2016: 1.39 (95% CI 1.25\u20131.54). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that country could contribute, independently of confounder variables, to outcome. The magnitude of the effect of country decreased over time.

In order to examine effects of an individual movement and spatial control measures on a disease outbreak, we developed a multiscale model and extended the semi-stochastic simulation method by linking individual movements to pathogen\u2019s diffusion, linking the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding/excretion at the individual level. Numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and, in particular, individuals\u2019 rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number [Formula: see text] , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak. It is interesting that a high level of aggregation the individuals\u2019 movement results in low new infections and a small final size of the infected population. Further, we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals, indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene. We found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy, and in particular, an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak, compared with local measures, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Yanni; Xiang, Changcheng; Cheke, Robert A.; Tang, Sanyi","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a3543e4cec9c6324987fc3bb0843ab28bb0b180.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222150.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease control","spatial control measures","individual level","population level","disease outbreak individuals","control efficacy","small final size","level of spatial heterogeneity","individual movements","disease transmission","high level of aggregation","frequent clearance","small peak","frequent environmental clearance lead","local measures","infected population","spatial contexts","total number of infected individuals","individuals\u2019 movement results","individuals\u2019 rapid movements","large-scale isolation strategy","uniform isolation strategy","high diffusion rate","pathogen shedding","fast dynamics","slow dynamics","pathogen\u2019s diffusion","peak value","environmental hygiene","low new infections","average reproduction number","decline","semi-stochastic simulation method","increase","excretion","infection status","multiscale model","air circulation","property of clustering","Formula","microscale","temporal","effects","need","macroscale","Numerical simulations","order","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum (OAC) has been proved as an easy, safe, and economically viable technique to help preterm neonates to build up their immunity. In this review, we assessed the effects of OAC on preterm infants. Several mainstream databases were searched including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and a website of clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAC vs. placebo or no intervention in preterm infants (gestation age \u003C34 weeks or birth weight \u003C1500 g) were eligible. Overall, nine RCTs (n = 689) were included in the review. Meta-analysis showed no statistical significance in terms of the incidence of NEC (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.33\u20131.06, p = 0.08), LOS (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.60\u20131.03, p = 0.08) and mortality rate (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.38\u20131.05, p = 0.07). No significant difference was found in the subgroup analysis, apart from the group of the undeveloped region in NEC and mortality. In addition, time was significantly reduced in terms of achieving full enteral feeding (MD = \u22123.60, 95% CI = \u22126.55\u20130.64, p = 0.02) and hospital stay (MD = \u221210.38, 95% CI = \u221218.47\u20132.29, p = 0.01). The results show that OAC does not reduce the incidences of NEC, LOS, and death in preterm infants, but there is a trend toward a positive effect. It is therefore recommended as routine care for preterm infants in the NICU.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Jiaxin; Mao, Jing; Yang, Jixin; Su, Yanwei","journal":"Eur J Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e279e7ca3a3617b831928ad657401d783d38ca07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Necrotizing"],"organizations":["NEC","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","OAC","NICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preterm infants","preterm neonates","RR","incidence of NEC","incidences of NEC","effects of OAC","terms","Randomized controlled trials","death","RCTs","MD","review","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","website of clinical trials","subgroup analysis","Meta-analysis","mortality rate","gestation age","PubMed","EMBASE","weeks","intervention","major contributors","birth weight","statistical significance","late-onset sepsis","placebo","viable technique","undeveloped region","routine care","Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum","Necrotizing enterocolitis","enteral feeding","trend","NICU","mainstream databases","significant difference","positive effect","time","immunity","hospital","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Thus all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation. In mechanistic studies the influenza virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were inhibited. In addition some extracts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected cells, and numerous other effects on the expression of cellular genes. Multiple components, either discrete compounds or mixtures, appeared to be responsible for the various antiviral activities.","publish_time":"2011-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hudson, James; Vimalanathan, Selvarani","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d16d9dcd360578447fca314b4f8b873b23acf0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4058675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["influenza virus-specific hemagglutinin","virus-infected cells","respiratory syncytial virus","herpes simplex virus","avian influenza viruses","Extracts of Echinacea species","potent antiviral activities","various antiviral activities","certain species","mechanistic studies","Recent studies","standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation","effects","anti-inflammatory activity","non-cytotoxic concentrations","control of symptoms","preparations","discrete compounds","mixtures","membrane","colds","rhinoviruses","strains of human","neuraminidase","Multiple components","North America","plant parts","expression of cellular genes","Tamiflu-resistant strain","addition","herbal medicines","diseases"],"language":"en"},

Community-based surveillance and control interventions have been heavily promoted but the most effective interventions have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: This review evaluated evidence for the effectiveness of community-based surveillance interventions at monitoring and identifying emerging infectious disease; the effectiveness of community-based control interventions at reducing rates of emerging infectious disease; and contextual factors that influence intervention effectiveness. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants Communities in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Types of intervention(s) Non-pharmaceutical, non-vaccine, and community-based surveillance or prevention and control interventions targeting rabies, Nipah virus, dengue, SARS or avian influenza. Types of outcomes Primary outcomes: measures: of infection or disease; secondary outcomes: measures of intervention function. Types of studies Original quantitative studies published in English. SEARCH STRATEGY: Databases searched (1980 to 2011): PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, WHOLIS, British Development Library, LILACS, World Bank (East Asia), Asian Development Bank. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Two independent reviewers critically appraised studies using standard Joanna Briggs Institute instruments. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: A customised tool was used to extract quantitative data on intervention(s), populations, study methods, and primary and secondary outcomes; and qualitative contextual information or narrative evidence about interventions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data was synthesised in a narrative summary with the aid of tables. Meta-analysis was used to statistically pool quantitative results. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included. Vector control interventions using copepods, environmental cleanup and education are effective and sustainable at reducing dengue in rural and urban communities, whilst insecticide spraying is effective in urban outbreak situations. Community-based surveillance interventions can effectively identify avian influenza in backyard flocks, but have not been broadly applied. Outbreak control interventions for Nipah virus and SARS are effective but may not be suitable for ongoing control. Canine vaccination and education is more acceptable than culling, but still fails to reach coverage levels required to effectively control rabies. Contextual factors were identified that influence community engagement with, and ultimately effectiveness of, interventions. CONCLUSION: Despite investment in community-based disease control and surveillance in Southeast Asia, published evidence evaluating interventions is limited in quantity and quality. Nonetheless this review identified a number of effective interventions, and several contextual factors influencing effectiveness. Identification of the best programs will require comparative evidence of effectiveness acceptability, cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Implications for practice Interventions are more effective if there are high levels of community ownership and engagement. Linkages between veterinary and public health surveillance systems are essential. Interventions are not well accepted when they fail to acknowledge the importance of animals for economic activity in communities. Implications for research Evidence is needed on functioning and outcomes of current surveillance systems and novel low-cost methods of surveillance. Evaluations of control interventions should control for confounding and report measures of disease, cost and sustainability. Translational research is needed to assess generalisability and evaluate roll-out of effective interventions as regional or national programs.","publish_time":"2013-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halton, Kate; Sarna, Mohinder; Barnett, Adrian; Leonardo, Lydia; Graves, Nicholas","journal":"JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec9040732c2587bf4776b0953905e8a87828e8cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4962925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","British Development Library"],"locations":["Cambodia","Indonesia","Laos","Malaysia","Thailand","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["based control interventions","Community-based surveillance interventions","Outbreak control interventions","Vector control interventions","Evaluations of control interventions","practice Interventions","number of effective interventions","community-based disease control","effectiveness of community","ongoing control","intervention effectiveness","outcomes of current surveillance systems","influence community engagement","Types of outcomes Primary outcomes","secondary outcomes","narrative evidence","contextual factors","research Evidence","Types of intervention","quantitative data","comparative evidence of effectiveness acceptability","public health surveillance systems","novel low-cost methods of surveillance","report measures of disease","high levels of community ownership","Types of studies Original quantitative studies","rates of emerging infectious disease","measures of intervention function","appraised studies","urban communities","Southeast Asia","DATA EXTRACTION","DATA SYNTHESIS","quantitative results","Nipah virus","qualitative contextual information","dengue","Participants Communities","SARS","education","avian influenza","rabies","sustainability","Implications","Asian Development Bank","urban outbreak situations","Science Direct","Web of Science","non-vaccine","World Bank","study methods","epicentre of recent epidemics of emerging","narrative summary","best programs","national programs","METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY","coverage levels","Translational research","British Development Library","WHOLIS","LILACS","Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Brunei","insecticide spraying","environmental cleanup","independent reviewers","standard Joanna Briggs Institute instruments","monitoring","Indonesia","Cambodia","EBSCOhost","copepods","functioning","infection","prevention","Singapore","Philippines","Myanmar","Malaysia","Laos","ProQuest","populations","cost-effectiveness","confounding","investment","customised tool","Thailand","CINAHL","economic activity","INCLUSION CRITERIA","Linkages","English","Viet Nam","importance of animals","zoonotic diseases","PubMed","generalisability","Canine vaccination","aid of tables","backyard flocks","roll","quantity","SEARCH STRATEGY","Databases","culling","Identification","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","Meta-analysis","Disagreements","discussion"],"language":"en"},

Abisko virus has a genome organization similar to that of the insect-infecting negeviruses, but phylogenetic and compositional bias analyses also reveal strong affiliations with plant-infecting viruses, such that both the primary host origin and taxonomic identity of the virus remain in doubt. In an extensive set of larval, pupal, and adult autumnal moth and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) outbreak samples, the virus was only detected in a few adult E. autumnata moths as well as the single larval transcriptome. The Abisko virus is therefore unlikely to be a factor in the Fennoscandia geometrid population dynamics.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Miranda, Joachim R.; Hedman, Harald; Onorati, Piero; Stephan, J\u00F6rg; Karlberg, Olof; Bylund, Helena; Terenius, Olle","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/719011222a3dd0642fb565e5f80fa03a184835eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5580471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Fennoscandia"],"keyphrases":["Abisko virus","RNA virus","adult autumnal moth","geometrid moth dynamics","winter moth","diseased autumnal moth","Fennoscandia geometrid population dynamics","single larval transcriptome","Epirrita autumnata","northern Fennoscandia","autumnata moths","transcriptome data","insect-infecting negeviruses","plant-infecting viruses","extensive set of larval","strong affiliations","Operophtera brumata","compositional bias analyses","mortality","cyclical nature","taxonomic identity","outbreak samples","factor","outbreaks","primary host origin","possible causes","genome organization similar","search","novel","doubt"],"language":"en"},

It is important to reduce unnecessary device utilization in order to decrease DA-HAI rates. Therefore, we investigate to the time trend of device utilization (DU) ratios and DA-HAI rates to analyzed collected data for 10 years through the Korean National Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance System (KONIS) which is voluntarily participating in hospitals. METHODS: We investigate the time trend of DU ratios and DA-HAI rates from 2006 through 2015 in KONIS participating intensive care units (ICUs). DA-HAI rates were calculated as the numbers of infections per 1,000 device-days and DU were calculated as a ratio of device-days to patient-days. The pooled incidences of DAIs and DU ratios were calculated for each year of participation. RESULTS: Data were collected on 5,325,176 catheter-days and 6,358,829 patient-days in the 190 participating ICUs between July 2006 and June 2016. From 2006 to 2015, year-wise ventilator utilization ratio (V-UR) per 1000 patients-days increased significantly from 0.40 to 0.454 (F = 6.27, P \u003C 0.0001), year-wise urinary catheter utilization ratio (UC-UR) show gradually increased trend from 0.83 to 0.84 but non-significantly (F = 1.66, P = 0.0951), and year-wise c-line utilization ratio (CL-UR) was gradually decreased non-significantly from 0.55 to 0.52 (F = 1.62, P = 0.1059). In subgroup analysis, Medical ICU (F = 2.79, P = 0.0034) or hospital with more than 900 beds (F = 3.07, P = 0.0015) related to increased significantly V-UR. Rate of ventilator associated pneumonia significantly decreased from 3.48 in 2006 to 1.00 in 2015 (per 1000 ventilator-days, F = 27.62, P \u003C 0.0001). Also, rates of catheter associated UTI and c-line associated blood stream infection significantly decreased from 1.85 to 0.88 (per 1000 catheter-days, F = 10.14, P \u003C 0.0001) and from 3.40 to 2.20 (per 1000 catheter-days, F = 14.17, P \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In Korea, all of the DA-HAIs have shown a significant reduction in the last 10 years, however V-UR has year-wise significantly increased trend for past 10-years, also UC-UR and CL-UR have not decreased trend significantly. We need effort to make reduction of device utilization ratios. DISCLOSURES: E. J. Kim, Korean Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (KONIS): Investigator, Research support; Y. HOURS.

As part of a randomized controlled trial to assess early detection of influenza in LTCFs, we deployed rapid influenza detection tests (RIDTs) at intervention LTCFs. Our primary objectives for this interim analysis were to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Quidel Sofia\u00AE Influenza A\u002BB Fluorescent Immunoassay RIDT in a high-risk, nontraditional population, and to describe the virology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in LTCF residents. METHODS: Personnel at LCTFs identified cases of ARI, collected nasal specimens, and ran RIDTs from 10/21/2016 to 4/28/2017. The residual nasal swab and leftover lysis buffer were placed into a viral transport medium tube and sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for confirmatory influenza RT-PCR testing. In addition, all specimens were tested for other viruses using the Luminex NxTAG\u00AE Respiratory Pathogen Panel. Sensitivity and specificity of the Sofia RIDT were calculated using RT-PCR results as the reference standard. RESULTS: Specimens were collected from 228 residents (mean age = 71.3 \u00B1 22.4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to specimen collection was 1.4 \u00B1 1.6 days (range: 0-7 days). Respiratory viruses were identified in 134/228 cases (58.8%); influenza viruses (A: 7.5% and B: 14.5%) were the most commonly detected virus by PCR, followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13.2%), RSV (11.0%) and coronaviruses (10.1%). The sensitivities of Sofia RIDT for influenza A and influenza B were 77.8% (95% CI: 52.4\u201393.6%) and 80.0% (95% CI: 61.4\u201392.3%), respectively, with specificities of 98.4% (95.3\u201399.7%) and 97.1% (93.4\u201399.1%), respectively. Overall performance assessment for influenza A or B yielded a sensitivity of 79.2% (65.0\u201389.5%) and specificity of 96.1% (91.7\u201398.6%). The estimated likelihood of discovering one of the first two influenza cases at a LTCF using this RIDT is estimated to be \u226595.7%. CONCLUSION: Although a wide constellation of respiratory viruses cause ARIs within LTCF populations, influenza is very common. Early ARI recognition in residents, with testing shortly after symptom onset, likely contributed to high performance of the Sofia RIDT. Use of RIDTs allows early identification of influenza with high sensitivity and specificity in elderly LTCF residents. DISCLOSURES: J.

We hypothesized that medical and non-medical procedures facilitate environmental dissemination of MRSA in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of hospitalized MRSA-colonized patients to determine the frequency of and risk factors for environmental shedding during procedures. Prior to each procedure, surfaces in the room and portable equipment used for procedures were disinfected. After procedures, high-touch surfaces and portable equipment were cultured; negative control cultures were collected after 1 hour in the absence of a procedure. Bivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with environmental shedding. RESULTS: Of 55 MRSA colonized patients, 22 (40%) had wounds and 25 (46%) had positive skin cultures. Environmental cultures were collected after 138 total procedures (range, 2 to 12 per patient). As shown in the figure, contamination of surfaces occurred frequently during procedures, but was uncommon in the absence of a procedure. Contamination occurred frequently on surfaces touched by personnel during procedures (12 of 38, 32% positive) and on portable equipment used for procedures (25 of 101, 25%). The presence of a wound was the only factor significantly associated with shedding (59% vs. 26%; P = 0.04).

An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy may limit the spread of infection; however, there is no consensus regarding PEP for MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed (1) the efficacy of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia, and (2) safety of the PEP regimen. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 43 HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV from 5 hospitals affected during this outbreak in South Korea. The rate of MERS-CoV infection was compared between 22 workers at 1 hospital who received PEP consisting of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir after exposure to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia and 21 workers at other hospitals who did not receive PEP. RESULTS: Six workers (14%) developed MERS-CoV infection; all of these subjects belonged to the non-PEP group. The attack rate was lower in the PEP group compared with the non-PEP group (0% vs. 28.6%; Odds ratio = 0.405, 95% confidence interval = 0.274\u20130.599; P = 0.009). The most commonly reported side effects of PEP therapy were nausea and diarrhea, but there were no severe adverse effects associated with PEP therapy.

Twenty male guinea pigs (initial BW 1.011 \u00B1 0.096 kg) were selected in a crossover design experiment, maintained at metabolic cages (2 animals per cage) during a total digestibility period of 25 d (2 periods of 13-d). Animals were randomly assigned at 1 of 2 altitudinal sites, 2986 and 2480 m. above the sea level (masl; 5 cages per altitude). Animals were fed 45 g of alfalfa (DM) to meet energy requirements at maintenance levels. At the end of the digestion phase, an animal from each cage was slaughter to determine body fat content from body specific gravity and visceral organ mass. A subsequent performance phase was evaluated as completely randomized design, and animals were kept at the same altitudinal floor in which they ended period 2 of the crossover period. Animals were fed ad libitum with alfalfa. At the end of the performance phase, all remaining animals were slaughtered and visceral organ mass was measured. Energy intake and Dry matter, were increased by animals at 2986 compared to animals at 2480 masl (P\u003C0.001). Metabolizable energy tended to be lower for animals kept at 2986 masl (P=0.053). Nutrient digestibility was lower for animals kept at 2986 compared to 2480 masl. Liver, kidneys and spleen mass were greater for animals maintained at 2986 masl (P\u003C0.012). Heart mass tended to be greater for animasl kept at 2480 masl (P=0,060). Body fat was not alterd by altitudinal site (P\u003E0.345). Final BW, ADG, and feed conversion rate was decreased by animals fed at 2986 masl (P\u003C0.002).

Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the continuous appearance of zoonotic MERS cases in humans is confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV from Africa has hitherto been poorly studied. Here, we report the genetic and phenotypic characterization of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in African countries. Phylogenetically, viruses from dromedaries in Africa formed a monophyletic clade, which we have provisionally designated as virus clade C. Molecular dating analyses of MERS-CoV, including clade C viruses, suggests that the ancestral MERS-CoV in dromedaries could have spread to the two continents within a short timeframe. Camel MERS-CoVs from west and north African countries form a subclade (C1) that shares genetic signatures of a major deletion in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung, and BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice. However, it is still inconclusive whether ORF4b deletions may lead to the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, D K W; Hui, K P Y; Perera, R A P M; Miguel, E; Oladipo, J O; Traore, A; Fassi-Fihri, O; Chan, M C W; Zhou, Z; So, R T Y; Chevalier, V; Peiris, J S M","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Camel"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Africa","Saudi Arabia","Burkina Faso","Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","ancestral MERS-CoV","zoonotic potential of MERS","phenotypic characterization of MERS","Camel MERS-CoVs","dromedaries","continuous appearance of zoonotic MERS cases","Molecular dating analyses of MERS","virus clade","zoonotic infection","West African viruses","African countries","clade C viruses","lower virus replication competence","virus isolates","reduced replication competence of BF785","Nig1657","genetic signatures","Arabian Peninsula","monophyletic clade","cultures of human bronchus","zoonotic respiratory disease of global public health concern","lower titer","phenotypic differences","ORF4b deletions","lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice","accessory gene ORF4b","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Saudi Arabia","dromedary camels","Burkina Faso","major deletion","Calu","Nigeria","humans","ex","cells","proven source","C1","subclade","continents","short timeframe"],"language":"en"},

Significant knowledge gaps exist for even the most studied emerging infectious diseases. Coupled with failures in the response to the resurgence of infectious diseases, this lack of information is embedded in a simplistic view of pathogens and disconnected from a social and ecological context, and assumes a linear response of pathogens to environmental change. In fact, the natural reservoirs and transmission rates of most emerging infectious diseases primarily are affected by environmental factors, such as seasonality or meteorological events, typically producing nonlinear responses that are inherently unpredictable. A more realistic view of emerging infectious diseases requires a holistic perspective that incorporates social as well as physical, chemical, and biological dimensions of our planet\u2019s systems. The notion of biocomplexity captures this depth and richness, and most importantly, the interactions of human and natural systems. This article provides a brief review and a synthesis of interdisciplinary approaches and insights employing the biocomplexity paradigm and offers a social\u2013ecological approach for addressing and garnering an improved understanding of emerging infectious diseases. Drawing on findings from studies of cholera and other examples of emerging waterborne, zoonotic, and vectorborne diseases, a \u201Cblueprint\u201D for the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is offered which integrates biological processes from the molecular level to that of communities and regional systems, incorporating public health infrastructure and climate aspects.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilcox, Bruce A.; Colwell, Rita R.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43a9eb01da480b44f686f789cd65b6972d590dfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resurgence of infectious diseases","studied emerging infectious diseases","unknown infectious diseases","vectorborne diseases","reemergence of diseases","realistic view of emerging infectious diseases","improved understanding of emerging infectious diseases","natural systems","examples of emerging waterborne","regional systems","environmental factors","planet\u2019s systems","linear response of pathogens","simplistic view of pathogens","biological dimensions","biological processes","biocomplexity paradigm","natural reservoirs","environmental change","notion of biocomplexity","ecological context","factors responsible","ecological approach","synthesis of interdisciplinary approaches","proposed interdisciplinary research framework","public health infrastructure","transmission rates","communities","insights","blueprint","holistic perspective","meteorological events","brief review","molecular level","lack of information","nonlinear responses","climate aspects","studies of cholera","seasonality","chemical","difficult scientific problems","society","depth","interactions of human","outbreaks","Significant knowledge gaps","findings","article","richness","failures"],"language":"en"},

There were wide ranges of initial levels of dormancy (9\u2013100%), rates of change of dormancy and response to the different storage conditions showing that species with several types of dormancy characteristics are able to coexist in these communities. The general trend in dormancy levels was a decline with time with the rate of decline greatest for seeds exposed on the soil surface and least for those stored in the laboratory. The species were divided into groups based on dormancy levels in seeds on the soil surface during the late dry and mid wet seasons. The dormancy characteristics of the groups were related to the ecology of the species in the groups.

The surveyed herds had at least one whole herd test, and BMRT was done at regular intervals in the period of the survey.

Strain 19 vaccination was thought to be an important cause of false\u2010positive reactions. Fifty\u2010three (2.0%) herds showed suspicious reactions on abattoir monitoring but none was declared infected on follow\u2010up testing. Of the 18 herds with infected or equivocal status, the BMRT identified 8. In a further 6 herds, the infected cattle were not in the milking herd. Four other herds had milkers with high CFT titres which could not be confirmed as infected on culture. In no herds were culture positive RBT or CFT reactors from the milking herd detected without the BMRT being positive. The proportion of false\u2010positive reactions to the BMRT was high but the BMRT proved very useful in identifying dairy herds infected with B. abortus, when the prevalence of brucellosis was very low.

Neutrophilic infiltration of synovium was somewhat more prominent than in chronic human RA, and activated lymphocytes in fluid or membrane were less frequent. The proliferative and plasma cell reaction seemed identical. Electron microscopy (EM) suggested microvascular injury with findings which included electron dense deposits in the vessel walls of 2 dogs. Seven dogs had meshworks of 20\u201025 mm tubules in tubuloreticular structures (TRS) similar to those seen in human systemic lupus erythematosus and only occasionally in human RA. There were also crystalline arrays of tubules, a configuration previously reported in tumors and virus infections and possibly suggestive of a cellular reaction to virus infection. To date no initiating agent has been identified, but this spontaneous canine disease which is very similar to human RA can provide a valuable model in which to examine pathogenesis of chronic arthritis.","publish_time":"2005-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schumacher, H.

A total of 759 non\u2010redundant peptides from AVPdb and HIPdb were divided into a training/test set having 683 peptides (T(683)) and a validation set with 76 independent peptides (V(76)) for evaluation.

Four different machine learning techniques (MLTs) namely Support vector machine, Random Forest, Instance\u2010based classifier, and K\u2010Star were employed.

More recent evidence shows that, while such direct interactions drive budding of alphaviruses, this may not be the case for negative strand RNA viruses and retroviruses. These viruses can bud particles in the absence of spike proteins, using only viral core components to drive the process. In some cases the spike proteins, without the viral core, can be released as virus\u2010like particles.

This is due to the availability of new molecular and experimental tools. Circumstantial evidence points towards a potentially causative role as well as to possibly protective effects of certain respiratory viruses in the cause of allergic asthma during early childhood. In addition, it now has become clear that exacerbations of asthma, in children as well as adults, are mostly associated with respiratory virus infections, with a predominant role of the common cold virus: rhinovirus. Careful human in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that rhinovirus can potentially stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro\u2010inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, may activate cholinergic\u2010 or noncholinergic nerves, increase epithelial\u2010derived nitric oxide synthesis, upregulate local ICAM\u20101 expression, and can lead to nonspecific T\u2010cell responses and/or virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell proliferation. Experimental rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma demonstrate features of exacerbation, such as lower airway symptoms, variable airways obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the latter being associated with eosinophil counts and eosinophilic cationic protein levels in induced sputum. This suggests that multiple cellular pathways can be involved in rhinovirus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations. It is still unknown whether these mechanisms are a distinguishing characteristic of asthma. Because of the limited effects of inhaled steroids during asthma exacerbations, new therapeutic interventions need to be developed based on the increasing pathophysiological knowledge about the role of viruses in asthma.","publish_time":"2001-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"GR\u00DCnberg, K.; Sterk, P.

METHODS: A population (n = 55) of non\u2010smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George\u0027s Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre\u2010bronchodilator FEV (1)% value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)\u2010\u03B2\u2010D\u2010glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics\u0027 FEV (1)% values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire\u2010based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV (1)% values. RESULTS: FEV (1)% results were correlated with ACQ scores (\u03C1 \u22120.586, P \u003C 0.001), SGRQ scores (\u03C1 \u22120.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (\u03C1 \u22120.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV (1)% values (\u03C1 \u22120.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV (1)% and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)\u2010\u03B2\u2010D\u2010glucan, or any of the allergens. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"McSharry, C.; Vesper, S.; Wymer, L.; Howieson, S.; Chaudhuri, R.; Wright, G.

Apoptosis was observed in vitro, while both apoptosis and necrosis were observed in tissues obtained from SARS patients. Viral proteins that can regulate apoptosis have been identified, and many of these also have the abilities to interfere with cellular functions. Occurrence of cell death in host cells during infection by other coronaviruses, such as the mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible porcine gastroenteritis virus, has also being extensively studied. The diverse cellular responses to infection revealed the complex manner by which coronaviruses affect cellular homeostasis and modulate cell death. As a result of the complex interplay between virus and host, infection of different cell types by the same virus does not necessarily activate the same cell\u2010death pathway.

Viruses have also gained counter\u2010defensive measures by producing virulence determinants called viral\u2010suppressors\u2010of\u2010RNAi (VSRs). Interestingly, in spite of dominance of interferon\u2010based immunity over RNAi in somatic cells of higher vertebrates, recent reports are accumulating in favour of retention of the antiviral nature of RNAi in mammalian cells. The present study focuses on the modulation of intracellular RNAi during infection with rotavirus (RV), an enteric virus with double\u2010stranded RNA genome. Intriguingly, a time point\u2010dependent bimodal regulation of RNAi was observed in RV\u2010infected cells, where short interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2010based RNAi was rendered non\u2010functional during early hours of infection only to be reinstated fully beyond that early infection stage. Subsequent investigations revealed RV nonstructural protein 1 to serve as a putative VSR by associating with and triggering degradation of Argonaute2 (AGO2), the prime effector of siRNA\u2010mediated RNAi, via ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. The proviral significance of AGO2 degradation was further confirmed when ectopic overexpression of AGO2 significantly reduced RV infection. Cumulatively, the current study presents a unique modulation of host RNAi during RV infection, highlighting the importance of antiviral RNAi in mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukhopadhyay, Urbi; Chanda, Shampa; Patra, Upayan; Mukherjee, Anupam; Komoto, Satoshi; Chawla\u2010Sarkar, Mamta","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f36f9dad489b1a29c4821d8ac3201766e33e5fc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162324.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based RNAi","mediated RNAi","antiviral nature of RNAi","modulation of intracellular RNAi","importance of antiviral RNAi","reduced RV infection","viral infection","unique modulation of host RNAi","dependent bimodal regulation of RNAi","mammalian cells","early hours of infection","early infection stage","infected cells","RV nonstructural protein","RNA interference","somatic cells of higher vertebrates","proviral significance of AGO2 degradation","ectopic overexpression of AGO2","short interfering RNA","stranded RNA genome","based immunity","current study","present study","prime effector of siRNA","triggering degradation of Argonaute2","nematodes","plants","evolutionary ancient innate immune response","recent reports","arthropods","enteric virus","virulence determinants","defensive measures","double","favour of retention","natural protection","suppressors","ubiquitin","interferon","rotavirus","time point","counter","Subsequent investigations","spite of dominance","proteasome pathway","putative VSR","Viruses","VSRs"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of MHC\u2010congenic LEWIS strains showed that RT1(a), RT1(c) and RT1(l) haplotypes are permissive for disease induction, whereas RT1(d) and RT1(u) are resistant. All EAE responding strains showed peptide\u2010specific proliferation and interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03B3 secretion, but no early significant tendency to express interleukin (IL\u20104) or transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010\u03B2 mRNA in lymphocytes in response to the MBP 63\u201388, 7 days post immunization (p.i.).

However, their ability to provide ecologically relevant information remains controversial. One of the major problems is understanding whether the measured responses are determined by stress factors or lie within the natural variability range. In a previous work, the natural variability of enzymatic levels in invertebrates sampled in pristine rivers was proven to be relevant across both space and time. In the present study, the experimental design was improved by considering different life stages of the selected taxa and by measuring more environmental parameters. The experimental design considered sampling sites in 2 different rivers, 8 sampling dates covering the whole seasonal cycle, 4 species from 3 different taxonomic groups (Plecoptera, Perla grandis; Ephemeroptera, Baetis alpinus and Epeorus alpicula; Tricoptera, Hydropsyche pellucidula), different life stages for each species, and 4 enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S\u2010transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase). Biomarker levels were related to environmental (physicochemical) parameters to verify any kind of dependence. Data were statistically elaborated using hierarchical multilevel Bayesian models. Natural variability was found to be relevant across both space and time. The results of the present study proved that care should be paid when interpreting biomarker results. Further research is needed to better understand the dependence of the natural variability on environmental parameters.

In the present study, the hydrogeochemical characterization of coastal freshwater herbaceous wetlands in the Ci\u00E9naga del Fuerte Protected Natural Area in Veracruz, Mexico, in the American tropics was carried out per plant community. Four herbaceous wetlands (alligator flag, saw grass, cattail, and floodplain pasture) were monitored to understand the origin of the water feeding these ecosystems, the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, and the relationship between the groundwater and ecology of these ecosystems during dry and rainy seasons. The results indicate that Ci\u00E9naga del Fuerte is located in a regional discharge area and receives local recharge, so it is fed by both regional and local flows. The chemical composition varied temporally and spatially, creating unique conditions that determined the habitat occupied by the hydrophytic vegetation. The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines wetland dynamics and affects wetland biota (ecohydrogeochemistry). Generalist plant communities established in zones of local recharge, whereas other more specialized and/or plastic communities inhabited zones receiving regional flows with greater ion concentrations.

Based on the 22\u2010residue, active Lys fragment of the mung bean trypsin inhibitor, a series of furin inhibitors were designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activity towards furin and kexin was evaluated using enzyme kinetic analysis. The most potent inhibitor, containing 16 amino acid residues with a K (i) value of 2.45 \u00D7 10(\u22129) m for furin and of 5.60 \u00D7 10(\u22127) m for kexin, was designed with three incremental approaches. First, two nonessential Cys residues in the Lys fragment were deleted via a Cys\u2010to\u2010Ser mutation to minimize peptide misfolding. Second, residues in the reactive site of the inhibitor were replaced by the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin, namely, Arg at P(1), Lys at P(2), Arg at P(4) and Arg at P(6). In addition, the P(7) residue Asp was substituted with Ala to avoid possible electrostatic interference with furin inhibition. Finally, the extra N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal residues beyond the doubly conjugated disulfide loops were further truncated. However, all resultant synthetic peptides were found to be temporary inhibitors of furin and kexin during a prolonged incubation, with the scissile peptide bond between P(1) and P(1)\u2032 being cleaved to different extents by the enzymes. To enhance proteolytic resistance, the P(1)\u2032 residue Ser was mutated to d\u2010Ser or N\u2010methyl\u2010Ser. The N\u2010methyl\u2010Ser mutant gave rise to a K (i) value of 4.70 \u00D7 10(\u22128) m for furin, and retained over 80% inhibitory activity even after a 3 h incubation with the enzyme. By contrast, the d\u2010Ser mutant was resistant to cleavage, although its inhibitory activity against furin drastically decreased. Our findings identify a useful template for the design of potent, specific and stable peptide inhibitors of furin, shedding light on the molecular determinants that dictate the inhibition of furin and kexin.","publish_time":"2006-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Hu; Zhang, Zhen; Shi, Jiahao; Shao, Xiao\u2010xia; Cui, Dafu; Chi, Cheng\u2010wu","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/071befa17120f3ea2c70678e7c77050a4053adae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["furin inhibition","inhibition of furin","molecule furin inhibitors","series of furin inhibitors","temporary inhibitors of furin","stable peptide inhibitors of furin","residue Ser","kexin","Ser mutant","terminal residues","Ser mutation","consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin","inhibitory activity","Arg","potent inhibitor","active Lys fragment","nonessential Cys residues","methyl","peptide misfolding","extra N","amino acid residues","residue Asp","value","scissile peptide bond","mung bean trypsin inhibitor","design of potent","prolonged incubation","h incubation","enzyme kinetic analysis","attractive drug candidates","shedding light","bacterial exotoxins","Ala","possible electrostatic interference","molecular determinants","cleavage","useful template","conjugated disulfide loops","viral infection","resultant synthetic peptides","reactive site","contrast","rise","different extents","enzymes","findings","proteolytic resistance","incremental approaches","addition"],"language":"en"},

We also very briefly review university programs and research institutions that have specific technical and institutional assets with significant potential to carry out research or to partially implement such a plan. Our review uses weighted values in a decision-system that takes in a variety of assets we consider fundamental to successful engagement in delivery of new, innovative, technology-enabled healthcare systems for under-resourced settings. We then review nine factors that hinder the advancement in healthcare in under-resourced settings, some of which are well described in current literature and some that may bring new perspectives. The paper then attempts to review how a proposed system can manage to operate successfully within the context of the nine named hindrance factors. The primary focus of the paper is in the description of a system which can increase the availability of diagnostics through technology-enabled systems.

Memory T cells achieve these functions through their high frequency and elevated activation state, which lead to rapid responses upon antigenic challenge. The significance and characteristics of memory CD8(\u002B) T cells in viral infections have been studied extensively. In many of these studies of T\u2010cell memory, experimental viral immunologists go to great lengths to assure that their animal colonies are free of endogenous pathogens in order to design reproducible experiments. These experimental results are then thought to provide the basis for our understanding of human immune responses to viruses. Although these findings can be enlightening, humans are not immunologically na\u00EFve, and they often have memory T\u2010cell populations that can cross\u2010react with and respond to a new infectious agent or cross\u2010react with allo\u2010antigens and influence the success of tissue transplantation. These cross\u2010reactive T cells can become activated and modulate the immune response and outcome of subsequent heterologous infections, a phenomenon we have termed heterologous immunity. These large memory populations are also accommodated into a finite immune system, requiring that the host makes room for each new population of memory cell.

In hepatitis C virus\u2010induced cirrhosis the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was reduced. Animal studies demonstrated a reduction of mortality and viral activity in herpes simplex virus encephalitis and influenza A virus pneumonia. In vitro studies revealed antiviral activity against HIV\u20101, SARS related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus.

These metabolites include polyphenolic compounds, the six so\u2010called catechins, and the methyl\u2010xanthine alkaloids caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Postharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases in green tea leaves prevents oxidation of the catechins, whereas postharvest enzyme\u2010catalyzed oxidation (fermentation) of catechins in tea leaves results in the formation of four theaflavins as well as polymeric thearubigins. These substances impart the black color to black teas. Black and partly fermented oolong teas contain both classes of phenolic compounds. A need exists to develop a better understanding of the roles of polyphenolic tea compounds in food and medical microbiology. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of activities of tea flavonoids and teas against foodborne and other pathogenic bacteria, virulent protein toxins produced by some of the bacteria, virulent bacteriophages, pathogenic viruses and fungi. Also covered are synergistic, mechanistic, and bioavailability aspects of the antimicrobial effects. Further research is suggested for each of these categories. The herein described findings are not only of fundamental interest, but also have practical implications for nutrition, food safety, and animal and human health.","publish_time":"2006-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friedman, Mendel","journal":"Mol Nutr Food Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2db7829a2826231ad8bf04e38b3035f42775fe0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tea flavonoids","green tea leaves","tea leaves results","roles of polyphenolic tea compounds","polyphenolic compounds","black teas","pathogenic bacteria","organic compounds","so\u2010called catechins","pathogenic viruses","classes of phenolic compounds","fungi","black color","fermented oolong teas","food safety","catalyzed oxidation","postharvest enzyme","virulent bacteriophages","virulent protein toxins","Postharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases","fermentation","methyl","present knowledge of activities","invading pathogens","bioavailability aspects","theobromine","xanthine alkaloids caffeine","animal","nutrition","insects","practical implications","better understanding","medical microbiology","theaflavins","plants","formation","human health","antimicrobial effects","theophylline","defense","overview surveys","substances","polymeric thearubigins","need","metabolites","findings"],"language":"en"},

Liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with MS/MS has been a reliable method for detecting glycopeptides in digestion mixtures, and for assigning glycosylation sites and glycopeptide sequences. Direct interfacing of LC with MS relies on electrospray ionization, which produces ions with two, three or four charges for most proteolytic peptides and glycopeptides. MS/MS spectra of such glycopeptide ions often lead to ambiguous interpretation if deconvolution to the singly charged level is not used. In contrast, the matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) technique usually produces singly charged peptide and glycopeptide ions. These ions require an extended m/z range, as provided by the quadrupole\u2010quadrupole time\u2010of\u2010flight (QqTOF) instrument used in these experiments, but the main advantages of studying singly charged ions are the simplicity and consistency of the MS/MS spectra. A first aim of the present study is to develop methods to recognize and use glycopeptide [M\u002BH](\u002B) ions as precursors for MS/MS, and thus for glycopeptide/glycoprotein identification as part of wider proteomics studies. Secondly, this article aims at demonstrating the usefulness of MALDI\u2010MS/MS spectra of N\u2010glycopeptides. Mixtures of diverse types of proteins, obtained commercially, were prepared and subjected to reduction, alkylation and tryptic digestion. Micro\u2010column reversed\u2010phase separation allowed deposition of several fractions on MALDI plates, followed by MS and MS/MS analysis of all peptides. Glycopeptide fractions were identified after MS by their specific m/z spacing patterns (162, 203, 291 u) between glycoforms, and then analyzed by MS/MS. In most cases, MS/MS spectra of [M\u002BH](\u002B) ions of glycopeptides featured peaks useful for determining sugar composition, peptide sequence, and thus probable glycosylation site. Peptide\u2010related product ions could be used in database search procedures and allowed the identification of the glycoproteins.

From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one\u2010fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2\u201310). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts. Development of a validated diagnostic test and an effective vaccine as well as elimination of possible animal reservoirs are measures needed to prevent another epidemic.","publish_time":"2003-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHAN\u2010YEUNG, Moira; XU, Rui\u2010Heng","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e464829aaafaf81c0614e71541bef79573fcfa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Effective control of disease","Hong Kong","early detection of disease","effective vaccine","cases","days","epidemic","Effective control of nosocomial transmission","prolonged incubation period","mean incubation period","community included tracing","contact precautions","high risk","Risk factors","infected surfaces","case fatality rate","old age","strict isolation of patients","SARS","compliance","practice of droplet","asymptomatic air travellers","comorbid illnesses","measures","droplets","validated diagnostic test","deaths","direct inoculation","elimination of possible animal reservoirs","housing estate","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","use of personal protective equipment","hospitalisation","Health care workers","outbreak","quarantine of contacts","global cumulative total","duration","onset of symptoms","Development","diabetes","novel coronavirus","range","Southern China","ages","Contaminated sewage","number of individuals","residents","Asian countries","People","females","end"],"language":"en"},

Globalization is not just an economic phenomenon, although it is frequently described as such, but includes commerce, disease and travel, and immigration, and as such it affects blood safety and supply in various ways. The relatively short travel times offered by modern aviation can result in the rapid spread of blood\u2010borne pathogens before measures to counteract transmission can be put in place; this would have happened with SARS if the basic life cycle of the SARS virus did not include an asymptomatic viraemia. This risk can be amplified by ecological factors which effect the spread of these pathogens once they are transferred to a na\u00EFve ecosystem, as happened with West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. The rationalization and contraction of the plasma products industry may be viewed as one aspect of globalization imposed by the remorseless inevitability of the market; the effect of this development on the safety and supply of products has yet to be seen, but the oversight and assurance of a shrinking number of players will present particular challenges. Similarly, the monopolization of technology, through patent enforcement which puts access beyond the reach of developing countries, can have an effect on blood safety. The challenges presented to blood safety by globalization are heightening the tensions between the traditional focus on the product safety \u2013 zero\u2010risk paradigm and the need to view the delivery of safe blood as an integrated process. As an illustration of this tension, donor deferral measures imposed by globalization\u2010induced risks such as vCJD and WNV have resulted in the loss of the safest and most committed portion of the blood donor population in many Western countries, leading to an increased risk to safety and supply. It is only through an appreciation of the basic needs of transfusion medicine, including the enunciation of appropriate principles to manage, rather than eliminate, risks, that the challenges imposed by globalization may be overcome.","publish_time":"2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farrugia, A.","journal":"ISBT Sci Ser","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63751161a879bf0d284633c4364091ae729003ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["blood safety","product safety","aspect of globalization","rapid spread of blood","blood donor population","effect","delivery of safe blood","supply of products","SARS virus","Western countries","WNV","increased risk","risk paradigm","particular challenges","pathogens","donor deferral measures","reach of developing countries","growing interdependence of countries","induced risks","monopolization of technology","West Nile virus","basic life cycle","short travel times","plasma products industry","widespread diffusion of technology","basic needs of transfusion medicine","border transactions","variety of cross","modern aviation","committed portion","shrinking number of players","access","increasing volume","patent enforcement","assurance","goods","contraction","market","traditional focus","remorseless inevitability","vCJD","tensions","development","various ways","North America","integrated process","enunciation of appropriate principles","services","oversight","disease","rationalization","appreciation","loss","illustration","transmission","ecological factors","na\u00EFve ecosystem","asymptomatic viraemia","commerce","immigration","economic phenomenon","place"],"language":"en"},

Thus, these findings strongly suggest that glycosylation of the viral proteins, and more precisely the presence of complex\u2010type oligosaccharides, is an important requirement for a completely efficient interaction with PBMC leading to the production of IFN\u2010\u03B1.","publish_time":"2006-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHARLEY, B.; LAVENANT, L.; DELMAS, B.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a31d6ea0972f8ce473d289cafcf5fe986346beb9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBMC","production of IFN\u03B1","infected cell monolayers","dependent inhibition of IFN\u03B1 induction","glycosylation of viral proteins","infected glutaraldehyde","viral infection of cell monolayers","coronavirus TGEV","pretreatment of TGEV","fixed cell monolayers","capacity of TGEV virions","type oligosaccharides","surface of infected cells","exposure","linked glycosylation","inhibition of N","complete cleavage of complex type","presence of complex","Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","tunicamycin","fixation","glycohydrolase","dose","important requirement","possibility","peptide","major role","efficient interaction","masking of carbohydrates","addition","interactions","ability","interferon alpha","present report","findings"],"language":"en"},

With multiple carbohydrate\u2010recognition domains, it is able to bind to sugar groups displayed on the surfaces of a wide range of microorganisms and thereby provide first\u2010line defence. Importantly, it also activates the complement system through a distinctive third pathway, independent of both antibody and the C1 complex. Three single point mutations in exon 1 of the expressed human MBL\u20102 gene appear to impair the generation of functional oligomers. Such deficiencies of functional protein are common in certain populations, e.g. in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, but virtually absent in others, e.g. indigenous Australians. MBL disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research and implicate a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes. Overall, there appears to be a genetic balance in which individuals generally benefit from high levels of the protein. However, in certain situations, reduced levels of circulating MBL may be beneficial to the host and this may explain the persistence of the deleterious gene polymorphisms in many population groups.","publish_time":"2006-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dommett, R.

Rare manifestations of AdV infections include hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic colitis, pancreatitis, nephritis, or meningoencephalitis. AdV infections are more common in young children, due to lack of humoral immunity. Epidemics of AdV infection may occur in healthy children or adults in closed or crowded settings (particularly military recruits). The disease is more severe and dissemination is more likely in patients with impaired immunity (e.g., organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus infection). Fatality rates for untreated severe AdV pneumonia or disseminated disease may exceed 50%. More than 50 serotypes of AdV have been identified. Different serotypes display different tissue tropisms that correlate with clinical manifestations of infection. The predominant serotypes circulating at a given time differ among countries or regions, and change over time. Transmission of novel strains between countries or across continents and replacement of dominant viruses by new strains may occur. Treatment of AdV infections is controversial, as prospective, randomized therapeutic trials have not been conducted. Cidofovir is the drug of choice for severe AdV infections, but not all patients require treatment. Live oral vaccines are highly efficacious in reducing the risk of respiratory AdV infection and are in routine use in the military in the United States, but currently are not available to civilians.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lynch, Joseph P.; Kajon, Adriana E.","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79ef7db8567a80406b8d83a80d72448242361073.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171713.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cidofovir"],"organizations":["AdV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["serotypes of AdV","severe AdV infections","Treatment of AdV infections","Epidemics of AdV infection","Rare manifestations of AdV infections","risk of respiratory AdV infection","untreated severe AdV pneumonia","mild infections","Different serotypes","clinical manifestations of infection","countries","patients","disease","predominant serotypes","human immunodeficiency virus infection","lower respiratory tract","hemorrhagic cystitis","hemorrhagic colitis","gastrointestinal tract","healthy children","young children","DNA viruses","impaired immunity","new strains","military recruits","given time","replacement of dominant viruses","different tissue tropisms","lack of humoral immunity","Transmission of novel strains","organ transplant recipients","hepatitis","continents","crowded settings","pancreatitis","adults","Fatality rates","routine use","drug of choice","nephritis","regions","dissemination","randomized therapeutic trials","Live oral vaccines","United States","Adenoviruses","AdVs","conjunctiva","meningoencephalitis","Cidofovir","civilians"],"language":"en"},

A major obstacle to the study of these diseases is the lack of convenient and quantitative methodologies, such as in vitro cell culture systems to grow and study (characterize) the virus. A beginning has been made with the recent development of protocols for the consistent preparation of primary shrimp lymphoid cells, which were employed for the quanta1 assay of some of the shrimp viral pathogens. The primary cell lines have also been used to analyze the synthesis of viral proteins at the cellular level and to study viral pathogenesis. With the further successful development of additional primary cell lines from other shrimp tissues and the establishment of continuous diploid and transformed shrimp cell lines, this problem is being solved. The value of cell culture systems is becoming increasingly clear. They present several obvious advantages because (1) they are more cost effective, sensitive, and convenient than whole animals, particularly for rapid monitoring of infectivity, (2) they yield quantitatively reproducible results, and (3) viral growth kinetics, biochemical and genetic characteristics, and so on can be studied more easily.

To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Ya-Li; Ding, Xiao-Rong; Poon, Carmen Chung Yan; Lo, Benny Ping Lai; Zhang, Heye; Zhou, Xiao-Lin; Yang, Guang-Zhong; Zhao, Ni; Zhang, Yuan-Ting *","journal":"IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c3ff8fdc5979f9bee3dfdc7f5d81077855ce842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acquisition of health","health informatics","realization of pervasive health information acquisition","long-term health monitoring","related information","treatment of major diseases","wearable technologies","unobtrusive sensing methods","Sensors","prevalence of chronic diseases","outbreaks of infectious diseases","major challenges","living environment","daily living","future directions of research","active area of interdisciplinary research","human skin","early prediction","smart textile technology","flexible-stretchable","retrieval","printable electronics","transmission","processing","storage","aging population","overview","cornerstone","stick-on electronic tattoos","unmet healthcare needs","accessories","present-day society","sensor fusion","clothing","paper"],"language":"en"},

To maintain the breadth of antibodies necessary for clinical protection, it is important to understand regional patterns of antibody seroprevalence in source plasma from which IG products are manufactured. In this study, source plasma from donation centers in various locations of the Southwestern quarter of the United States was surveyed for antibody titers to hepatitis A virus (HAV), measles virus (MeV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). A broad range of anti-HAV Ig plasma titers was observed among these centers, with some centers exhibiting 3\u20135 times the titers of the others. Minor to no differences were observed for levels of anti-MeV and anti-CMV, respectively. Importantly, elevated anti-HAV Ig titers were broadly observed across plasma units obtained from the centers exhibiting high titers, indicative of a potential regional phenomenon among donors as opposed to few donors with singularly high titers. Plasma from these high-titer centers conferred significantly greater neutralization against HAV in vitro.

The diagnosis of scrub typhus could be missed diagnosis due to the absence of the pathognomonic eschar. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old man was hospitalized with fever and kidney injury and was diagnosed of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome first. However, the situation of the illness deteriorated into refractory septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction rapidly,although the treatment of anti-sepsis was used in 3rd-5th day. Orientia tsutsugamushi was determined to be the causative pathogen by Next-generation sequencing of his plasma sample in 6th day. Then, the patient was treated with doxycycline and azithromycin and recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Next-generation sequencing was a new diagnostic technology and could identify scrub typhus in accurately and fast without the pathognomonic eschar.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jie; Zheng, Xu-dong; Dai, Qi-he; Hong, Wei-li; Li, You-peng; Chen, Rui; Ye, Bing-bing; Mo, Xiao-jie; Cui, Peng; Ruan, Zhan-wei","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f53957baf0d35623ad97fd89c434e305aa54cc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137524/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of scrub typhus","generation sequencing","Orientia tsutsugamushi","pathognomonic eschar","day","hemorrhagic fever","acute febrile illness","refractory septic shock","multiple organ dysfunction","new diagnostic technology","year-old man","kidney injury","plasma sample","causative pathogen","renal syndrome","absence","BACKGROUND","treatment of anti-sepsis","CASE PRESENTATION","patient","doxycycline","azithromycin","bite of chiggers","situation","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1992\u20101995) searches were conducted for publications on asthma, environmental tobacco smoke, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulates. STUDY SELECTION: Representative original experimental and epidemiological studies and reviews of viral infections in asthma. DATA SYNTHESIS: Respiratory virus infections are the most common and important trigger of asthma attacks in children and probably also in adults. Their role in promoting development of asthma is not so clear. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is almost certainly responsible for some cases of childhood asthma, and can also trigger symptoms of bronchoconstriction in adults with asthma. Exposure to ozone or nitrogen dioxide is associated with symptoms, impaired lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and hospital presentations for asthma. These pollutants may also act as cofactors in the development of allergen\u2010specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Research on preventing upper respiratory viral infections may reduce asthma morbidity. The move to non\u2010smoking workplaces is welcome, but new interventions are needed to prevent young women taking up smoking and subsequently exposing their children. The ambient air quality guideline for ozone should be revised and a health\u2010based guideline for respirable particulates introduced.","publish_time":"1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abramson, Michael J; Marks, Guy B; Pattemore, Philip K","journal":"Med J Aust","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6565d681de8df513b09a1b270b4833fbf5230be0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of asthma","asthma morbidity","cases of childhood asthma","important trigger of asthma attacks","environmental tobacco smoke","ozone","upper respiratory viral infections","Respiratory virus infections","reviews of viral infections","roles of viral respiratory tract infections","nitrogen dioxide","children","Exposure","adults","specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness","air pollution","development of allergen","ambient air quality guideline","symptoms of bronchoconstriction","based guideline","respirable particulates","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA SOURCES","epidemiological studies","impaired lung function","hospital presentations","new interventions","health","Research","publications","STUDY SELECTION","young women","non\u2010smoking workplaces","MEDLINE","cofactors","CONCLUSIONS","searches","pollutants","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Due to rebreathing of CO(2) as compared to fresh gas, pendelluft might reduce ventilatory efficiency possibly exacerbating patient\u2019s respiratory workload during weaning. Our aim was to measure pendelluft by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: This is an observational study conducted in a general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. EIT signal was recorded in 20 patients while pressure support (PS) ventilation was progressively reduced from clinical level (baseline) to 2 cmH(2)O, as in an SBT; four ventral-to-dorsal lung regions of interest were identified for pendelluft measurement. A regional gas movement (\u003E 6 mL) occurring in a direction opposite to the global EIT signal was considered diagnostic for high pendelluft. RESULTS: Eight patients out of 20 (40%) were classified as high-pendelluft; baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between high- and low-pendelluft patients. At PS reduction, pendelluft and EtCO(2) increased more in the high-pendelluft group (p \u003C .001 and .011, respectively). The volume of gas subject to pendelluft moved almost completely from the ventral towards the dorsal lung regions, while the opposite movement was minimal (16.3 [10:32.8] vs. 0 [0:1.8] mL, p = .001). In a subgroup of patients, increased pendelluft volumes positively correlated with markers of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate, p0.1, and EtCO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Occult pendelluft can be measured by EIT, and is frequently present in patients failing an SBT. When present, pendelluft increases with the reduction of ventilator support and is associated with increased EtCO(2), suggesting a reduction of the ability to eliminate CO(2).","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coppadoro, Andrea; Grassi, Alice; Giovannoni, Cecilia; Rabboni, Francesca; Eronia, Nilde; Bronco, Alfio; Foti, Giuseppe; Fumagalli, Roberto; Bellani, Giacomo","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b16074b9eacc99ce06a84e41d8951375d79b4bd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","EIT","SBT","PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high pendelluft","Occult pendelluft","pendelluft measurement","low-pendelluft patients","increased pendelluft volumes","high-pendelluft group","movement of gas","subgroup of patients","increased EtCO","dorsal lung regions","present","SBT","different lung regions","increased respiratory rate","regional gas movement","lung overstretching","fresh gas","opposite movement","PS reduction","global EIT signal","clinical level","ventral","volume of gas subject","reduction of ventilator support","markers of respiratory distress","patient\u2019s respiratory workload","baseline clinical characteristics","mechanical ventilation","pressure support","tertiary-level teaching hospital","ventilatory efficiency","general intensive care unit","animal models","electrical impedance tomography","observational study","spontaneous breathing trial","p0","weaning","cmH","direction","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","aim","BACKGROUND","ability","RESULTS","rebreathing"],"language":"en"},

The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution. METHOD: We retrospectively studied adult (\u2265 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 \u2265 0.5, group 2 0.25\u20130.49, group 3 0.17\u20130.24, and group 4 \u003C 0.17 ml/kg/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders. RESULT: A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P \u003C .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66\u20130.91; P = .01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml/kg/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06\u20131.41; P = .004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60\u20130.85; P \u003C .001). CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25\u20130.50 ml/kg/min (i.e., completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Bo; Chen, Joy C.

There is also concern that these alternative methods may pose a risk to workers and patients. Objectives. (1) Determine the efficacy of a germicidal UV-C wand for surface disinfection, (2) evaluate changing relative humidity (RH) and different target distances on bacteria kill rates, and (3) assess potential exposure concerns. Methods. This study investigates whether a hand-held germicidal wand can efficaciously disinfect surfaces treated with either a vegetative or spore forming bacterium and to evaluate the effect of changing environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH), target position, and target distances on microbial kill rates. Results. Kill rate was best at 40\u201365% RH at a temperature range of 21\u201324\u00B0C. Both high and low RH interfered with the ability of UV-C to kill the vegetative microbe. In the case of the spore forming bacterium, increased surface drying time was the most significant factor increasing kill rate. Conclusions. This research demonstrates that UV-C was efficacious under optimal conditions, a direct beam exposure, and a short target distance (12.7 cm). However, there are limitations when used in non-optimal conditions. Increased distance and indirect beam angles resulted in lower kill rates. It is also important to minimize unnecessary patient and worker exposure during its use.","publish_time":"2017-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byrns, George; Barham, Beverly; Yang, Liangcheng; Webster, Kathryn; Rutherford, George; Steiner, Garrett; Petras, Daniel; Scannell, Michele","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/063ef853a4d797646b484d16345ed589a979fcc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower kill rates","microbial kill rates","target position","germicidal UV-C wand","low RH","adjunct methods","alternative methods","different target distances","short target distance","conventional disinfection methods","direct beam exposure","surface disinfection","worker exposure","bacterium","environmental conditions","non-optimal conditions","ability of UV","Increased distance","changing relative humidity","spore","hand-held germicidal wand","potential exposure concerns","increased surface drying time","vegetative microbe","indirect beam angles","healthcare associated infections","significant factor","room fumigation","unnecessary patient","morbidity","mortality","risk","surfaces","bacteria","ultraviolet irradiation","use","workers","study","limitations","effect","efficacy","patients","temperature range","case","research","Results","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Infections seem to be here to stay and have increased in importance in spite of enormous success in the field of prophylactic efforts, hygiene, vaccinology, and treatment. A large number of new agents and infections have appeared during the last decades. Conditions earlier thought to have other etiologies are today known to be distinct and have been proven to be of infectious origin. Infections alone can constitute major incidents, or they can be part of or a consequence of an incident. Even in the relatively new incident category of terrorism, infections must be seriously considered. Climate change and other changes in nature today constitute major threats of increasing infectious incidents. The increasing problem with antimicrobial resistance is, at present, considered to be one of the strongest disease threats. Infectious incidents are unique in the sense that they usually have an insidious onset, have a time span before they are detected as present or even as serious. Once the infection has started to spread, the development and increase can be extremely quick, even logarithmic. The extent of infectious incidents can be larger than that of most other disasters, and is best exemplified through different pandemics.

At times, the nature of the network involved in the transmission of the pathogen (bacteria, virus, macro-parasite, etc.) appears to be clear; however, the nature of the network involved is dependent on the scale (e.g. within-host, between-host, or between-population), the nature of the contact, which ranges from the highly specific (e.g. sexual acts or needle sharing at the person-to-person level) to almost completely non-specific (e.g. aerosol transmission, often over long distances as can occur with the highly infectious livestock pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus\u2014FMDv\u2014at the farm-to-farm level, e.g. Schley et al. in J. R. Soc. Interface 6:455\u2013462, 2008), and the timescale of interest (e.g. at the scale of the individual, the typical infectious period of the host). Theoretical approaches to examining the implications of particular network structures on disease transmission have provided critical insight; however, a greater challenge is the integration of network approaches with data on real population structures.

It is typically characterized by four main (cardinal) symptoms: spiking fever \u226539 \u00B0C, arthralgia or arthritis, skin rash, and hyperleukocytosis (\u226510,000 cells/mm(3)). However, many other clinical features are possible, and it can appear in all age groups with potentially severe inflammatory onset accompanied by a broad spectrum of disease manifestation and complications. Hence, it remains a diagnostic challenge, and the clinician should first rule out infectious, tumoral, or inflammatory differential diagnoses. Determination of the total and glycosylated ferritin levels, although not pathognomonic, can help in diagnosis. New biomarkers have recently been described, but they need to be validated. The disease evolution of AoSD can be monocyclic, polycyclic, or chronic. In chronic disease, a joint involvement is often predominant, and erosions are noted in one-third of patients. Many progresses have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis over the last decades. This chapter provides a comprehensive insight into the complex and heterogeneous nature of AoSD describing the identified cytokine signaling pathways and biomarkers. It also discusses the current evidence for the usage of biologics in AoSD to provide guidance for treatment decisions, taking into account both the efficacy and the safety of the different therapeutic options.","publish_time":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitrovic, St\u00E9phane; Feist, Eugen; Fautrel, Bruno","journal":"Periodic and Non-Periodic Fevers","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9e5849131e8539ca4197a5f5aa3ef6e83d0ba57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123329.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123329/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic disease","disease evolution of AoSD","systemic autoinflammatory disease","Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease","heterogeneous nature of AoSD","broad spectrum of disease manifestation","severe inflammatory onset","New biomarkers","inflammatory differential diagnoses","identified cytokine","safety","spiking fever","arthritis","arthralgia","glycosylated ferritin levels","skin rash","comprehensive insight","usage of biologics","joint involvement","hyperleukocytosis","total","cardinal","symptoms","account","tumoral","treatment decisions","guidance","age groups","complications","pathways","different therapeutic options","clinician","efficacy","current evidence","Determination","understanding","pathogenesis","clinical features","diagnostic challenge","erosions","chapter","progresses","decades","diagnosis","cells","patients"],"language":"en"},

The anthrax attack coincided with the first report in 2002 of the de novo synthesis in the test tube of a pathogenic human virus, poliovirus, that was equally shocking because it indicated that dangerous infectious agents could be produced in laboratories outside of government control.

The administrative and organizational reforms have not been without its setbacks or obstacles; however, they were not so insurmountable that they could not be overcome by one of Korea\u2019s greatest assets: persisting endeavors to build back better and to enhance resilience. Starting with an independent national agency in 2004 to manage natural and human-caused disasters and preparedness, the government quickly realized, through focusing events, it was insufficient to handle the increasing complexity and intensifying of disasters striking the nation. Therefore, through political will and hindsight, it continuously coalesced pertinent disaster management responsibilities into newer and newer agencies until 2016, when it enacted a progressively more ubiquitous and self-propelling agency. However, although the agency is apt for current disasters, it will not be for future disaster, which needs the integration of resilience into Disaster Risk Management (DRM). Therefore, we suggest five tenets on how to make Korea\u2019s resilient future as well as for other nations that are and will follow in Korea\u2019s footsteps, especially for those nations in Asia and Africa. A future that is resilient against all types of disaster risks, especially being prepared well for \u201Clow probability and high impact\u201D focusing events that are located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution.","publish_time":"2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yong-kyun; Sohn, Hong-Gyoo","journal":"Disaster Risk Management in the Republic of Korea","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a74cd505e565a0fefb38fc76d93ecc1a39c04bb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123419.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Disaster Risk Management"],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["future disaster","Korea\u2019s resilient future","Disaster Risk Management","current disasters","types of disaster risks","coalesced pertinent disaster management responsibilities","events","Korea\u2019s footsteps","nations","Korea\u2019s greatest assets","self-propelling agency","independent national agency","newer agencies","integration of resilience","high impact","persisting endeavors","hindsight","way","DRM","long-tail","low probability","Power-law Distribution","increasing complexity","preparedness","human","government","organizational reforms","setbacks","arduous undertaking","Asia","Africa","tenets","Republic of Korea","obstacles"],"language":"en"},

Balancing these principles with a patient\u2019s right to make autonomous decisions to guide their own medical care, especially when a patient refuses a recommended treatment, can be difficult.","publish_time":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishibashi, Kimiko; Lewis, Shaye; Baker, Timothy","journal":"Problem-based Behavioral Science and Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/731750c7f73db321ad61847e252069d4018af077.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123503.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123503/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doctor","patient relationship conflict","ethical principles","trust","patient\u2019s right","patient\u2019s best interests","beliefs","autonomous decisions","way","conflicting values","ethics","morals","medical care","health","wellness","sickness","balance","recommended treatment","beneficence","foundation","act of confronting problems","patients","harm","different factors","chapter"],"language":"en"},

These experimental approaches take advantage of a variety of observables. Changes in the protein aggregation pattern have been monitored through fluorescence properties such as spectra, intensities (related to quantum yields), time-decays, and anisotropies of intrinsic protein fluorophores, of extrinsic fluorescent tags and, even, of the same small molecules added to modulate PPIs, as well as through bimolecular excited-state processes such as static and collisional quenching, including electron and excitation-energy transfer, or exciton interaction, whose efficiencies are crucially structure dependent. Besides allowing for qualitative and quantitative information on the small-molecule induced PPI modulation, these approaches can take advantage from the sensitivity of fluorescence observables on fine structural details to shed light on the molecular-scale mechanisms of action and their functional consequences. Direct investigation of the latter by kinetic inhibition analysis represents a useful change in perspective whenever PPI are relevant for enzyme activity. Dissociative inhibition, that is, the ability of some small molecules to inhibit enzymes by disrupting their active oligomeric assembly is shortly reviewed.","publish_time":"2013-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ponterini, Glauco","journal":"Disruption of Protein-Protein Interfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6b840cb6f4ccc42866a8ead89f24c6af68b633a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123529.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["small molecules","small-molecule induced PPI modulation","molecular-scale mechanistic investigation of PPI modulation","kinetic analysis","fluorescence properties","sensitivity of fluorescence observables","kinetic inhibition analysis","potential of fluorescence","advantage","molecular-scale mechanisms of action","Direct investigation","variety of observables","experimental approaches","Dissociative inhibition","protein aggregation pattern","anisotropies of intrinsic protein fluorophores","screening","useful change","electron","light","perspective","fine structural details","collisional quenching","excitation-energy transfer","based methods","time-decays","intensities","enzymes","bimolecular excited-state processes","extrinsic fluorescent tags","exciton interaction","quantum yields","quantitative information","spectra","functional consequences","enzyme activity","efficiencies","active oligomeric assembly","Changes","PPIs","ability","representative examples"],"language":"en"},

Assessing the BW threat is challenging, however, because illicit development and production can be concealed at dual-use industrial sites such as vaccine plants, and only tens of kilograms of an agent like dried anthrax spores can be militarily significant. The lack of unambiguous technical signatures of BW-related activity means that most estimates of foreign capabilities draw heavily on human intelligence sources, yet spies and defectors are notoriously unreliable. A key factor driving BW proliferation is the perceived military utility of biological weapons, which may include strategic deterrence, asymmetric warfare, or covert operations. Globalization of the biotechnology industry has expanded trade in dual-use materials and production equipment, increasing the risks of diversion and misuse for BW purposes. With the advent of flexible biological manufacturing systems, it has also become possible for countries to acquire a \u201Clatent\u201D capacity for BW production during a crisis or war. Since the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, sub-state actors have become a prominent part of the threat matrix, but terrorist acquisition and use of BW requires both the motivation to use disease as a weapon and the technical capability to do so, a combination that is quite rare. At present the threat of mass-casualty BW attacks emanates primarily from nation-states, while terrorist use of biological weapons will likely remain limited in scale and impact. Nevertheless, the emergence of new biotechnologies with a potential for misuse could result in more damaging incidents of bioterrorism in the future.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tucker, Jonathan B.","journal":"Biopreparedness and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f033212ea9e60c06898659da68679378d681483.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","Iran","North Korea","Russia","Syria"],"keyphrases":["BW production","BW threat","BW proliferation","BW purposes","casualty BW attacks","terrorist use of biological weapons","states of biological weapons","lack of unambiguous technical signatures of BW","perceived military utility of biological weapons","misuse","production equipment","threat matrix","threat of mass","anthrax letter attacks","advent of flexible biological manufacturing systems","proliferation concern","government sources","technical capability","terrorist acquisition","dried anthrax spores","human intelligence sources","Iran","sub-state actors","related activity","China","nation-states","North Korea","asymmetric warfare","agent","strategic deterrence","risks of diversion","estimates of foreign capabilities","vaccine plants","tens of kilograms","Russia","biotechnology industry","potential","trade","industrial sites","materials","crisis","capacity","damaging incidents of bioterrorism","emergence of new biotechnologies","covert operations","key factor","future","Syria","defectors","disease","scale","motivation","combination","countries","impact","Globalization","illicit development"],"language":"en"},

This process is usually very accurate. However, in some cases, recoding events occur at selected codons, leading to a high frequency of frameshifting or stop codon readthrough. The factors influencing these noncanonical decoding events are very diverse; among them are the codon usage and context, the presence of a stable mRNA secondary structure downstream of the decoding sites and the type and relative abundance of normally modified tRNA. Here, we discuss the role of certain modified nucleotides of tRNAs in a few cases of frameshifting and readthrough that occur in Bacteria and Eukarya. While in some cases the effect of a given modified nucleotide in a tRNA is to increase accuracy of the recoding process, in a few other cases the reverse has been observed. This review illustrates the power of using well characterized recoding systems, coupled with specific defects of RNA modification enzymes to assay for translational fidelity under in vivo conditions.","publish_time":"2005-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Namy, Olivier; Lecointe, Fran\u00E7ois; Grosjean, Henri; Rousset, Jean-Pierre","journal":"Fine-Tuning of RNA Functions by Modification and Editing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e03e153ea70a6cca66e7c82009d0bc815b5e2d85.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eukarya"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of frameshifting","modified tRNA","recoding events","recoding process","decoding sites","codon readthrough","given modified nucleotide","characterized recoding systems","strict decoding rules","selected codons","codon usage","role of certain modified nucleotides of tRNAs","high frequency of frameshifting","stable mRNA secondary structure","presence","specific defects of RNA modification enzymes","relative abundance","type","translational fidelity","context","power","ribosome","effect","noncanonical","Bacteria","protein synthesis","accuracy","conditions","factors","Eukarya","review","reverse"],"language":"en"},

There are growing numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and up to 20% of all patients admitted to an ICU carry a diagnosis of malignancy. Respiratory failure remains the most common reason for ICU admission and remains the leading causes of death in oncology patients. There are many causes of respiratory failure in this population. Pneumonia is the most common cause of respiratory failure, yet there are many causes of respiratory insufficiency unique to the cancer patient. These causes are often a result of immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Treatment is focused on supportive care and specific therapy for the underlying cause of respiratory failure. Noninvasive modalities of respiratory support are available; however, careful patient selection is paramount as indiscriminate use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is associated with a higher mortality if mechanical ventilation is later required. Historically, respiratory failure in the cancer patient had a grim prognosis. Outcomes have improved over the past 20 years.

It is frequently observed after viral rhinitis or common cold. Viral, post-viral, and acute bacterial ARS (ABRS) display significantly similar clinical presentation and inflammatory mechanism. Viral infection of the sinus cavity can cause numerous changes such as post-viral inflammation and epithelial damage, which enhance the susceptibility to bacterial infection. The most common virus families that cause ARS are coronavirus and rhinovirus. Approximately 50% of common colds are caused by the human rhinovirus. Other viral offenders include parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and enterovirus. The most widely recognized bacteria in ABRS are S. pneumonia, H. influenza, and M. catarrhalis and S. aureus, while other species and anaerobic bacteria may also contribute to the infection (Payne and Benninger, Clin Infect Dis 45(10):e121\u20137, 2007; Anonymous, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 130(1 SUPPL):1\u201345, 2004; Brook, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 128(5):583\u20135, 2002). Interestingly, Payne and colleagues performed a meta-analytic study on reports about the microbiology of ABRS, which evaluated the most common bacterial occurrence within the sinus. S. aureus is commonly associated with the pathogenesis of sphenoid sinusitis. The 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine was presented in the United States in 2000 and aided in the reduction of the recovery rate for S. pneumoniae and the increase in the rate of H. influenza. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) vary in comparison to ARS. Bacteria that have been recorded in many samples acquired by endoscopy or sinus puncture in CRS patients are Staphylococcus aureus (both MSSA and MRSA), Staphylococci (coagulase-negative) (SCN), H. influenza, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumonia, S. intermedius, P. aeruginosa, N. species, and other anaerobic bacteria.

The ILD consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high-resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes the linear and reticular pattern, the nodular pattern, the increased attenuation pattern (such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation), and the low attenuation pattern (such as emphysema and cystic lung diseases). In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, the final diagnosis of many ILD requires close cooperation between clinicians and radiologists and complementary lung biopsy is recommended in many cases.","publish_time":"2017-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mueller-Mang, Christina; Ringl, Helmut; Herold, Christian","journal":"Multislice CT","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34a36bc42d6c39f9461d5d1893b2d58ee41b268e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121385.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121385/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILD","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILD","cystic lung diseases","term interstitial lung diseases","diverse group of diseases","lung apex","collagen vascular diseases","drug-related diseases","nodular pattern","reticular pattern","indicative of interstitial lung disease","increased attenuation pattern","low attenuation pattern","complementary lung biopsy","final diagnosis","accuracy of diagnosis","specific diagnosis","idiopathic interstitial pneumonias","combination of patterns","CT morphology","group of miscellaneous","management of patients","disorders of known cause","disorders of unknown etiology","collimation","clinicians","volumetric high-resolution scanning","diagnostic armamentarium","radiologists","close cooperation","emphysema","continuous data acquisition","distal airways","alveoli","high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm","consolidation","base","fibrosis","various entities","identification","septal interstitium","central bronchovascular","peripheral subpleural","ground-glass opacities","key method","interpreter","spectrum of morphologic characteristics","IIPs","MDCT","inflammation","correct clinical context","characterization of parenchymal abnormalities","detection","anatomic distribution","abnormality","lungs","overlap","cases"],"language":"en"},

At the end of the pregnancy, the concentration of maternal antibodies is higher in the cord blood, than in the maternal circulation. Simultaneously, the immune system of the fetus begins to work and from the second trimester, fetal IgM is produced by the fetal immune system specific to microorganisms and antigens passing the maternal-fetal barrier. The same time the fetal immune system has to cope and develop tolerance and T(REG) cells to the maternal microchimeric cells, latent virus-carrier maternal cells and microorganisms transported through the maternal-fetal barrier. The maternal phenotypic inheritance may hide risks for the newborn, too. Antibody mediated enhancement results in dengue shock syndrome in the first 8 month of age of the baby. A series of pathologic maternal antibodies may elicit neonatal illnesses upon birth usually recovering during the first months of the life of the offspring. Certain antibodies, however, may impair the fetal or neonatal tissues or organs resulting prolonged recovery or initiating prolonged pathological processes of the children. The importance of maternal anti-idiotypic antibodies are believed to prime the fetal immune system with epitopes of etiologic agents infected the mother during her whole life before pregnancy and delivery. The chemotherapeutical and biological substances used for the therapy of the mother will be transcytosed into the fetal body during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. The long series of the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and conjugates has not been tested systematically yet. The available data are summarised in this chapter. The innate immunity plays an important role in fetal defence. The concentration of interferon is relative high in the placenta. This is probably one reason, why the therapeutic interferon treatment of the mother does not impair the fetal development.","publish_time":"2012-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berencsi, Gy\u00F6rgy; Szomor, Katalin N.","journal":"Maternal Fetal Transmission of Human Viruses and their Influence on Tumorigenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e75f054fdd40882cfab57a44521ef706e9c8b20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal-fetal barrier","concentration of maternal antibodies","fetal IgM","fetal defence","fetal body","fetal development","maternal circulation","fetal immune system specific","series of pathologic maternal antibodies","maternal microchimeric cells","maternal phenotypic inheritance","importance of maternal anti-idiotypic antibodies","mother\u2019s antibodies","Certain antibodies","latent virus-carrier maternal cells","therapeutic monoclonal antibodies","microorganisms","concentration of interferon","trimesters of pregnancy","life","therapeutic interferon treatment","prolonged recovery","neonatal tissues","neonatal illnesses","long series","human fetus","prolonged pathological processes","antigens","dengue shock syndrome","Antibody mediated enhancement results","organs","epitopes of etiologic agents","important role","cord blood","risks","birth","tolerance","innate immunity","biological substances","month of age","months","placenta","children","therapy","reason","conjugates","time","available data","chapter","baby","newborn","offspring","delivery","end"],"language":"en"},

Obtaining atomic-resolution 3D structure better than ~2.5 \u00C5 is a standard approach in pharma companies to design and optimize therapeutic compounds against drug targets like proteins. Protein crystallography is the main technique in solving the structures of drug targets at atomic resolution. However, this technique requires protein crystals which in turn is a major bottleneck. It was not possible to obtain the structure of proteins better than 2.5 \u00C5 resolution by any other methods apart from protein crystallography until 2015. Recent advances in single-particle cryo-EM and 3D image processing have led to a resolution revolution in the field of structural biology that has led to high-resolution protein structures, thus breaking the cryo-EM resolution barriers to facilitate drug discovery. There are 24 structures solved by single-particle cryo-EM with resolution 2.5 \u00C5 or better in the EMDataBank (EMDB) till date. Among these, five cryo-EM 3D reconstructions of proteins in the EMDB have their associated coordinates deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB), with bound inhibitor/ ligand. Thus, for the first time, single-particle cryo-EM was included in the structure-based drug design (SBDD) pipeline for solving protein structures independently or where crystallography has failed to crystallize the protein. Further, this technique can be complementary and supplementary to protein crystallography field in solving 3D structures. Thus, single-particle cryo-EM can become a standard approach in pharmaceutical industry in the design, validation, and optimization of therapeutic compounds targeting therapeutically important protein molecules during preclinical drug discovery research. The present chapter will describe briefly the history and the principles of single-particle cryo-EM and 3D image processing to obtain atomic-resolution structure of proteins and their complex with their drug targets/ligands.","publish_time":"2019-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Natesh, Ramanathan","journal":"Structural Bioinformatics: Applications in Preclinical Drug Discovery Process","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c830dac79ef5d445dfe0d37de16b810d4087b56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single-particle cryo-EM","cryo-EM resolution barriers","D structures","atomic resolution","high-resolution protein structures","atomic structures of drug targets","\u00C5 resolution","protein crystals","protein crystallography field","atomic-resolution structure of proteins","Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy","D image processing","resolution revolution","structure-based drug design","important protein molecules","D reconstructions of proteins","Protein Data Bank","principles of single","preclinical drug discovery research","standard approach","EMDB","main technique","optimization of therapeutic compounds","field of structural biology","SBDD","validation","pipeline","complex","associated coordinates","PDB","pharmaceutical industry","pharma companies","turn","history","importance","years","Recent advances","methods","bound inhibitor","EMDataBank","ligands","time","major bottleneck","present chapter","date"],"language":"en"},

Elicitors are compounds that induce plants to produce secondary metabolites at elevated levels and reduce the processing time required to achieve high product concentrations. Hairy root cultures are considered as an excellent alternative for the supply of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites/bioactives, due to their inherent genetic and biochemical stability. Plant-based secondary metabolites are well accepted in India as well as other countries to cure even the serious medical problems. In this chapter, three medicinally important plants are discussed in which stress-based elicitation of secondary metabolites has been achieved in hairy root cultures. These three plants contain important secondary metabolites in their different parts. Glycyrrhizin found in Glycyrrhiza glabra plant is used as antiulcer, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, and anti-inflammatory. Glycyrrhizin is also effective against HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses. In Solanum plant, steroidal glycoalkaloids contain pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites. Solasodine, a major alkaloid of Solanum plant, is used as a contraceptive in different parts of the world. Ajmaline and ajmalicine are important root-specific indole alkaloids of Rauwolfia serpentina. Ajmalicine is useful in circulatory disorders, while ajmaline is principally known for its antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive activities.

This trend has resulted in an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization across this population [1]. Acute respiratory failure is the most frequent medical complication leading to critical illness in oncologic patients [2\u20134]. Historically, there had been a reluctance to admit cancer patients to the ICU given their poor outcomes, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy and invasive mechanical ventilation [5]. ICU treatment limitations or refusal of admission was advocated [6]. Major advances in oncologic care, critical care and more meticulous attention to where the conditions overlap, have resulted in marked improvement in short-term survival in this population [1, 7, 8]. Despite these major advances, acute respiratory failure in this population remains complex with unique challenges surrounding diagnosis and management compared to the general ICU population. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of acute respiratory failure in the oncologic population and highlights specific considerations for the intensivist. We will focus on the important differences between the immunocompromised oncologic patient and general intensive care population, the spectrum of causes of acute respiratory failure with a specific focus on toxicities related to newer cancer therapies, diagnostic approach, management and an up-to-date overview of prognosis.","publish_time":"2018-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferreyro, B.

However, significant improvements in ICU and in-hospital survival of cancer patients in ICU have been demonstrated in studies in recent years [1\u20134]. Risk factors for mortality have shifted from those related to the underlying condition to those related to the severity of acute illness similar to other critically-ill patients. Neutropenia per se and the underlying malignancy (solid and hematological) do not have an impact on the outcome of patients in ICU. Recent chemotherapy is associated rather with improved survival [3, 5\u20137], while organ dysfunction, severity of disease scores, need for vasopressor treatment, need for mechanical ventilation immediately or after noninvasive ventilation, no definite diagnosis and a non-infectious diagnosis are associated with mortality [1\u20133, 8]. Invasive aspergillosis is also associated with very high mortality rates in ICU (see below). In several studies, admission to ICU in the early stages of sepsis or other acute event was associated with better survival than admission later, after development of organ dysfunction. Performance status is perhaps the most important and only variable relating to the underlying condition that is correlated with ICU death. The prognosis remains guarded for certain cancer patients, including patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with active uncontrolled graft versus host disease, those with relapse of the primary disease after allogeneic HSCT and special cases of solid cancer including pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis and carcinomatous meningitis with coma [9].","publish_time":"2012-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Humphreys, Hilary; Winter, Bob; Paul, Mical","journal":"Infections in the Adult Intensive Care Unit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bfe03ffd662aae8cfb183994cd9b712a0073e3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["admission of cancer patients","certain cancer patients","hospital survival of cancer patients","ill patients","outcome of patients","ICU death","ominous prognosis of cancer patients","underlying condition","special cases of solid cancer","allogeneic HSCT","host disease","primary disease","severity of disease scores","better survival","neutropenia","underlying malignancy","improved survival","studies","development of organ dysfunction","high mortality rates","need of critical care","carcinomatous meningitis","mechanical ventilation","noninvasive ventilation","acute event","definite diagnosis","severity of acute illness similar","non-infectious diagnosis","Recent chemotherapy","recent years","pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","active uncontrolled graft","early stages of sepsis","vasopressor treatment","reservations","relapse","regard","coma","impact","variable","significant improvements","Performance status","Risk factors","Invasive aspergillosis"],"language":"en"},

The resulting neutropenia as well as injury to the pulmonary and gastrointestinal mucosa allow pathogenic micro-organisms easy access to the body. The symptoms of an incipient infection are usually subtle and limited to unexplained fever due to the absence of granulocytes. This is the reason why prompt administration of antimicrobial agents while waiting for the results of the blood cultures, the so-called empirical approach, became an undisputed standard of care. Gram-negative pathogens remain the principal concern because their virulence accounts for serious morbidity and a high early mortality rate. Three basic intravenous antibiotic regimens have evolved: initial therapy with a single antipseudomonal \u03B2-lactam, the so-called monotherapy; a combination of two drugs: a \u03B2-lactam with an aminoglycoside, a second \u03B2-lactam or a quinolone; and, thirdly, a glycopeptide in addition to \u03B2-lactam monotherapy or combination. As there is no single consistently superior empirical regimen, one should consider the local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates in the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen. Not all febrile neutropenic patients carry the same risk as those with fever only generally respond rapidly, whereas those with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection show a much slower reaction and less favorable response rate. Once an empirical antibiotic therapy has been started, the patient must be monitored continuously for nonresponse, emergence of secondary infections, adverse effects, and the development of drug-resistant organisms. The averageduration of fever in serious infections in eventually successfully treated neutropenic patients is 4\u20135 days. Adaptations of an antibiotic regimen in a patient who is clearly not responding is relatively straightforward when a micro-organism has been isolated; the results of the cultures, supplemented by susceptibility testing, will assist in selecting the proper antibiotics. The management of febrile patients with pulmonary infiltrates is complex. Bronchoscopy and a high resolution computer-assisted tomographic scan represent the cornerstones of all diagnostic procedures, supplemented by serological tests for relevant viral pathogens and for aspergillosis. Fungi have been found to be responsible for two thirds of all superinfections that may surface during broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients. Antibiotic treatment is usually continued for a minimum of 7 days or until culture results indicate that the causative organism has been eradicated and the patient is free of major signs and symptoms. If a persistently neutropenic patient has no complaints and displays no evidence of infection, early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy or a change to the oral regimen should be considered.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herbers, Alexandra; de Pauw, Ben E.","journal":"Managing Infections in Patients With Hematological Malignancies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["empirical antibiotic therapy","initial antibiotic regimen","broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients","\u03B2-lactam monotherapy","febrile neutropenic patients","early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy","single antipseudomonal \u03B2-lactam","basic intravenous antibiotic regimens","superior empirical regimen","local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates","initial therapy","oral regimen","management of febrile patients","serious infections","so-called monotherapy","so-called empirical approach","evidence of infection","culture results","documented infection","incipient infection","combination","unexplained fever","averageduration of fever","symptoms","days","high early mortality rate","serious morbidity","pulmonary infiltrates","blood cultures","Gram-negative pathogens","human body","susceptibility testing","high resolution computer","emergence of secondary infections","relevant viral pathogens","favorable response rate","gastrointestinal mucosa","pathogenic micro-organisms easy access","serological tests","slower reaction","selection","tomographic scan","adverse effects","principal concern","virulence accounts","injury","change","deleterious effect","development of drug","diagnostic procedures","prompt administration of antimicrobial agents","defense system","components","reason","cornerstones","superinfections","free of major signs","nonresponse","addition","complaints","drugs","risk","aminoglycoside","undisputed standard of care","causative organism","Aggressive chemotherapy","resistant organisms","aspergillosis","Bronchoscopy","minimum","glycopeptide","absence of granulocytes","resulting neutropenia","thirds","quinolone","Adaptations","proper antibiotics","Fungi"],"language":"en"},

Most infants admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory support during this infection are previously healthy, but their principal risk for needing PICU treatment is young age. That is, if you are born in October/November in the northern hemisphere, then your first winter exposure to RSV is likely to be when you are less than 4 months of age and vulnerable because of poor respiratory mechanical reserve (Alonso et al. 2007).

Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital as well as allopurinol and sulfonamides, are the most common causes of DIDMOHS. Impaired drug detoxification and herpes virus reactivation play a key role in DIDMOHS pathogenesis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes also contribute. Early cutaneous findings generally include a morbilliform eruption characterized by diffuse, erythematous, pruritic macules across the face, upper trunk, and upper extremities with later extension to the lower extremities. Rapid confluence and progression are characteristic. DIDMOHS frequently involves the lymphatic, hematologic, and hepatic systems. Renal, pulmonary, and cardiac dysfunction may also ensue. Early recognition and diagnosis with prompt withdrawal of the culprit drug is paramount. Corticosteroid therapy is widely accepted as the cornerstone of DIDMOHS management. Moving forward, haplotyping and assays such as the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) will aid in the primary prevention and diagnosis of DIDMOHS.

Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the body\u2019s defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction is vital for the management and treatment of key and enigmatic pulmonary disorders.","publish_time":"2010-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Eddie T.; Wang, Ting; Garcia, Joe G.

In the past decade, there has been a shift from an isolated histopathological diagnosis to a multidisciplinary acquired diagnosis consensus that is nowadays regarded to provide the highest level of diagnostic accuracy in patients with diffuse interstitial lung diseases. The 2002 ATS/ERS statement on classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias assigned a central role to high-resolution CT (HRCT) in the diagnostic workup of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (ATS/ERS consensus classification 2002). The more recent 2013 ERS/ATS statement reinforced that combined clinical data (presentation, exposures, smoking status, associated diseases, lung function, and laboratory findings) and radiological findings are essential for a multidisciplinary diagnosis (Travis et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 188(6):733\u2013748, 2013). The traditional HRCT consisted of discontinuous 1 mm high-resolution axial slices. The primary focus was on visual pattern analysis demanding for the highest possible spatial resolution. Because of the intrinsic high structural contrast of the lung, it has been possible to substantially reduce dose without losing diagnostic information. This development has been supported by new detection and reconstruction techniques. Not only detection of subtle disease and visual comparison of disease stage but also disease classification and quantification nowadays take advantage of continuous volumetric data acquisition provided by multidetector row (MD) CT technique. The following book chapter will focus on acquisition technique with special emphasis on dose and reconstruction, advantages, and new diagnostic options of volumetric MDCT technique for interstitial lung diseases. Based on evidence from the literature, certain diseases will be covered more specifically, but it has to be noted that for the pattern analysis of the various interstitial lung diseases, the plethora of other publications and books is recommended.","publish_time":"2016-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hovinga, Marieke; Sprengers, Ralf; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia","journal":"Multidetector-Row CT of the Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63f44a5f42730bf322769d38f499627a19f254d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diffuse interstitial lung diseases","various interstitial lung diseases","high-resolution CT technique","lung function","associated diseases","certain diseases","classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias","diagnostic workup of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias","acquisition technique","disease classification","ERS consensus classification","multidisciplinary diagnosis","ATS statement","ERS statement","diagnostic information","new diagnostic options of volumetric MDCT technique","visual pattern analysis","multidisciplinary acquired diagnosis consensus","detection of subtle disease","highest level of diagnostic accuracy","radiological findings","new detection","dose","visual comparison of disease stage","isolated histopathological diagnosis","high-resolution axial slices","advantage of continuous volumetric data acquisition","laboratory findings","clinical data","highest possible spatial resolution","reconstruction techniques","traditional HRCT","primary focus","valuable radiological modality","patients","multidetector row","exposures","smoking status","central role","Travis","quantification","advantages","plethora","special emphasis","presentation","J Respir Crit Care Med","DILD","shift","intrinsic high structural contrast","following book chapter","evidence","literature","publications","books","computed tomography","development","past decade"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are classified as DNA viruses and RNA viruses. Imaging of viral encephalitis is often nonspecific showing focal or diffuse edema (acute infection) or focal atrophy (chronic infection). Location of the lesion depends on causative agent, thus, HSV encephalitis displays an almost pathognomonic involvement of the limbic system. The various steps in the pathogenesis include entry into the body, delivery of the virus to the target tissue, interaction of virus with target tissue, cytopathogenesis, host responses, immunopathology, virus production in a tissue with release of the virus to other people (contagion), and transmission of viruses. Treatment consists of administration of antiviral drugs which aim at altering virion disruption, attachment, penetration and uncoating, RNA synthesis, genome replication, virion assembly and release. Clinical outcome depends on age of infection, nature of disease, severity of disease, and progression of viral disease. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is a serious health problem worldwide as 33 million adults and 2 million children are infected with HIV-1. The brain is often involved which leads to the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) of which asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) represent various stages. The neuropathologic changes in HIV-1 induced lesions, i.e. HIV-1 encephalitis (characterized by multiple disseminated foci composed of microglia, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) predominantly located in the cortex, deep gray matter, and the white matter), HIV-1 leukoencephalopathy (diffuse damage to the white matter), lymphocytic meningitis (LM), perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (PLI), vacuolar myelopathy (VM), vacuolar leukoencephalopathy (VL) are described. Therapy might lead to the immune restituiton inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The sequelae of HIV-1 infection of the nervous system include changes in neuronal number, neuronal size, synapses, dendrites, nerve fibers, astroglia, oligodendroglia, microglia/macrophages, vessels, vascular endothelial cells, and capillaries.

Ventilation of aircraft has several significant variables that require control measures that are seldom of concern for occupied space at ground level. The principal of these special requirements are the need to compensate for the substantial difference between cabin and outside pressures, the much lower available space per occupant in aircraft cabins, and the need for coping with more extreme external temperatures than are common at ground level. The breadth of these concerns is of interest in the policies and regulatory aspects of a number of agencies which are briefly described, and their roles and areas of potential interest outlined. Types of possible contaminants are listed, and the limits which have been set by several of these agencies for many of these potential contaminants are tabulated. In addition recent measured aircraft cabin concentrations of several key contaminants are listed. This chapter provides an overview of the general air quality variables affecting enclosed space to enable these to be related to the special needs of some of the less common enclosed spaces described in the following chapters.","publish_time":"2005-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cone, James E.","journal":"Air Quality in Airplane Cabins and Similar Enclosed Spaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b804b92b9bb72ad4f6d03b58cbe6cb3be8b5f1cf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. National Academy of Sciences Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aircraft cabin air quality","aircraft cabins","Ventilation of aircraft","potential contaminants","occupied space","ground level","key contaminants","addition recent measured aircraft cabin concentrations","general air quality variables","lower available space","common enclosed spaces","Types of possible contaminants","significant variables","number of agencies","special requirements","special needs","areas of potential","outside pressures","substantial difference","overview","occupant","extreme external temperatures","policies","commentary","regulatory aspects","control measures","attention","National Academy of Sciences Committee","following chapters","detailed examination","concerns","roles","principal","breadth","limits"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by the progressive worsening of lung function and has a poor prognosis (median survival is approximately 3 years). However, the clinical course of disease shows considerable individual variability. Therefore, it is important to monitor the clinical course and to predict prognosis for optimal therapy. Serum biomarkers are both less invasive and reproducible diagnostic tools. Useful biomarkers for patients with IPF are strongly coveted; however, to date, there are no biomarkers that are globally known. In Japan, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and KL-6 are commonly used as serum markers of interstitial pneumonia, including IPF, in the clinical setting, and empirical data has been accumulated over 10 years. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins and members of the collectin family. These collectins have been shown to function as host defense lectins in the lung. KL-6 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein and now classified as a human MUC1 mucin protein. These three proteins are mainly synthesized by alveolar type II cells. The mechanisms of increase for these protein levels in sera of patients with IPF are probably a combination of a loss of epithelial integrity due to injury and an increased mass of type II cells due to hyperplasia. It has been revealed that those proteins are useful for monitoring the clinical course and predicting prognosis as well as for the diagnosis of IPF. In this review article, the molecular structures and biological functions of these biomarkers are outlined, and we discuss the clinical application of these biomarkers for patients with IPF.","publish_time":"2015-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiba, Hirofumi; Takahashi, Hiroki","journal":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ff98b887589c1051e445c9724cbb5d5973a2639.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of IPF","Useful biomarkers","Serum biomarkers","clinical course of disease","clinical setting","clinical application","SP-D","protein levels","poor prognosis","sera of patients","hydrophilic proteins","surfactant protein","cells","years","serum markers of interstitial pneumonia","progressive worsening of lung function","molecular structures","interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause","alveolar type","human MUC1 mucin protein","increased mass of type","high molecular weight glycoprotein","injury","members","combination","considerable individual variability","biological functions","loss of epithelial integrity","specific form of chronic","median survival","review article","collectin family","mechanisms of increase","empirical data","reproducible diagnostic tools","host defense lectins","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","Japan","optimal therapy","hyperplasia","date","collectins"],"language":"en"},

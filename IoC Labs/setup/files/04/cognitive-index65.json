With limited access to clinical specimens, animal models could advance our understanding of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) disease and viral persistence. Here, we summarize current findings on HIV-1 CNS infection from nonhuman primate (NHP) models and discuss their implications for improving pediatric clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS SIV/SHIV can be found in the CNS of infant macaques within 48 h of challenge. Recent studies show an impermeable BBB during SIV infection, suggesting neuroinvasion in post-partum infection is likely not wholly attributed to barrier dysfunction. Histopathological findings reveal dramatic reductions in hippocampal neuronal populations and myelination in infected infant macaques, providing a link for cognitive impairments seen in pediatric cases. Evidence from humans and NHPs support the CNS as a functional latent reservoir, harbored in myeloid cells that may require unique eradication strategies. Studies in NHP models are uncovering early events, causes, and therapeutic targets of CNS disease as well as highlighting the importance of age-specific studies that capture the distinct features of pediatric HIV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Obregon-Perko, Veronica; Bricker, Katherine; Chahroudi, Ann","journal":"Current HIV/AIDS reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-020-00503-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS infection","SIV infection","CNS of infant macaques","NHP models","pediatric cases","Recent studies","post-partum infection","pediatric clinical outcomes","RECENT FINDINGS SIV","therapeutic targets of CNS disease","distinct features of pediatric HIV","animal models","specific studies","Histopathological findings","current findings","infected infant macaques","understanding of pediatric central nervous system","clinical specimens","cognitive impairments","PURPOSE OF REVIEW Perinatal HIV","neurologic impairments","hippocampal neuronal populations","myelination","neuroinvasion","dramatic reductions","myeloid cells","early events","causes","link","impermeable BBB","nonhuman primate","functional latent reservoir","implications","limited access","NHPs","increased risk","SHIV","unique eradication strategies","importance of age","h of challenge","viral persistence","humans"],"language":"en"},

A \u0027closed-off management\u0027 protocol has been launched nationwide in China to cope with this major public health emergency. However, these procedures may cause a crisis for blood donation and blood supply. In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donation and supply in Zhejiang province, which could provide reference and insight for developing countermeasures in other countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood donor and supply information from 38 blood centres during the Spring Festival of 2019 and 2020 were reviewed. A self-administered questionnaire was carried out. RESULTS Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of whole blood donors dropped by 67%. The success rate of recruitment for donations dropped by 60%. Most respondents (81\u00B72%) were worried about the \u0027possibility of acquiring COVID-19 during blood donation\u0027. The total amount of RBCs supply dropped by 65%. In the first week of the outbreak, the weekly amount of issued RBC units (10171\u00B75 u) was almost six times higher than the collected units (1347\u00B75 u). The mean haemoglobin value for RBCs transfusion was about 6\u00B73 g/dl. About 4% of RBCs and 2\u00B78% of frozen plasma were used in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION The secondary consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are blood shortages caused by the unavailability of blood donors, and this is likely to be replicated in many countries with high burdens of COVID-19. Practical actions to broaden sources and reduce use for the global crisis must be taken proactively.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yongjun; Han, Wenjuan; Pan, Lingling; Wang, Cuier; Liu, Yan; Hu, Wei; Zhou, Huapin; Zheng, Xiaofan","journal":"Vox sanguinis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["blood supply","blood donation","blood centres","blood shortages","unavailability of blood donors","METHODS Blood donor","RBCs supply","high burdens of COVID","possibility of acquiring COVID","supply information","RBCs transfusion","countries","worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease","collected units","global crisis","issued RBC units","OBJECTIVES","Zhejiang province","sources","reference","use","mean haemoglobin value","times higher","MATERIALS","number","major public health emergency","secondary consequences","success rate of recruitment","donations","China","outbreak","insight","countermeasures","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Spring Festival","frozen plasma","impact","Practical actions","protocol","week","procedures","millions of people","self-administered questionnaire","management","study","RESULTS","patients","respondents"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS Identifying predictors of adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery is vital in the decision-making process for surgeons and patients. Recently, automated risk calculators have been developed to quantify patient-specific preoperative risk associated with certain orthopedic procedures. Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature. Currently, many risk calculators show promise, but much research is still needed to improve them. We recommend they be used only as adjuncts to clinical decision-making.

It plays a key role in the access of the virus into the cell to produce the final infection. In the present study we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of ACE2 in the lung and provided evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19. Specifically, we used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of ACE2-correlated genes. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network containing the genes co-expressed with ACE2. Finally, we focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their role for a potential treatment of Covid-19. Our results demonstrate that the genes correlated with ACE2 are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity. We identified a network of 193 genes, 222 interactions and 36 potential drugs that could have a crucial role. Among possible interesting drugs for Covid-19 treatment, we found Nimesulide, Fluticasone Propionate, Thiabendazole, Photofrin, Didanosine and Flutamide.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cava, Claudia; Bertoli, Gloria; Castiglioni, Isabella","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12040404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus","CoA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["correlated genes","potential drugs","genes co-","main functions of ACE2","adenosylhomocysteinase activity","Aryldialkylphosphatase activity","effective drugs","known drugs","Gene Expression Omnibus","gene expression profiles","CoA ligase activity","basic mechanism of ACE2","potential treatment of Covid","trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity","Gene Ontology","SARS-CoV","protein-protein interaction network","possible interesting drugs","crucial role","key role","main cell receptor of SARS","Genotype-Tissue Expression","acetate-CoA","Cancer Genome Atlas","public datasets","pathway enrichment analysis","Thiabendazole","sterol biosynthetic process","Photofrin","Fluticasone Propionate","silico","lung","evidences","Didanosine","Nimesulide","Angiotensin","enzyme","access","interactions","Previous studies","Flutamide","virus","present study","final infection","results"],"language":"en"},

The Air Transportation System plays a critical role in such transmissions because it is responsible for fast and long-range human travel, while its building components-the airports-are crowded, confined areas with usually poor hygiene. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) consider hand hygiene as the most efficient and cost-effective way to limit disease propagation. Results from clinical studies reveal the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of infectious diseases. However, its potential as a mitigation strategy against the global risk for a pandemic has not been fully explored. Here, we use epidemiological modeling and data-driven simulations to elucidate the role of individual engagement with hand hygiene inside airports in conjunction with human travel on the global spread of epidemics. We find that, by increasing travelers engagement with hand hygiene at all airports, a potential pandemic can be inhibited by 24% to 69%. In addition, we identify 10 airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing mitigation strategy. Increasing hand-washing rate at only those 10 influential locations, the risk of a pandemic could potentially drop by up to 37%. Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infections that could shape the way public-health policy is implemented with respect to the overall objective of mitigating potential population health crises.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicolaides, Christos; Avraam, Demetris; Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis; Gonz\u00E1lez, Marta C; Juanes, Ruben","journal":"Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31872479/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airports","effectiveness of hand hygiene","effect of hand washing","global risk","poor hygiene","potential pandemic","role of individual engagement","global spread of infections","global spread of epidemics","global transmission of flu","mitigation strategy","Results","way public-health policy","long-range human travel","World Health Organization","individual mobility patterns","overall objective of mitigating potential population health crises","critical role","individual transmissibility of infectious diseases","cost-effective way","Disease Control","travelers engagement","disease propagation","Prevention","CDC","conjunction","type viruses","data-driven simulations","humans","respect","cost-optimal deployment","clinical studies","building components","epidemiological modeling","physical contact","Air Transportation System","transmissions","core","confined areas","evidence","influential locations","Centers","addition"],"language":"en"},

This chapter discusses the role of viruses (and virologists) in defining comparative genomics. The reasons why viruses have been popular as model systems are relatively simple: The number of genes in virus genomes is small, and the number of genetically homogeneous progeny that can be obtained in the laboratory is large. The combinatorial approach to classification (at least to virus classification) appears to produce a larger number of possibilities than are actually employed by nature. This results in many empty classes in Agol\u0027s scheme and in Koonin\u0027s classification. Apparently, the evolutionary process operates under constraints, so its results do not look like the product of indiscriminate mixing and matching. Perhaps every combinatorial classification should be expected to contain many empty classes. The auxiliary evidence strongly supported sequence similarities among the proteins conserved in RNA viruses: First, there was plenty of genetic data mapping replication ability to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain.

Many different bacterial species normally colonize the mouth. Host defense mechanisms, including those associated with the ciliated epithelium in the nose and sinuses, lysozyme in saliva, and IgA and other immunoglobulins in mucous secretions or serum, may help reduce the incidence of infections because of respiratory pathogens. The normal mouth flora probably contributes to the prevention of attachment of exogenous pathogens to the mucosa. Nevertheless, certain respiratory pathogens are sometimes carried asymptomatically in the mouth or nose of healthy individuals. Upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in infants and young school children. An average preschool child is said to have about six upper respiratory tract infections a year. Most of the infections are of viral etiology and occur in winter. Bacterial infections are also very common in young children. The eustachian tubes in infants are relatively wider and more horizontal than in adults; this might partly explain the greater incidence of acute otitis media in infants as the causative organisms may spread directly from the throat to the middle ear via the eustachian tube. Older children and adults usually have good immunity to a wide range of respiratory pathogens, but the common cold continues to be prevalent in these age groups. Sinusitis frequently occurs in adults and children.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shanson, D.C.","journal":"Microbiology in Clinical Practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173452/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of infections","Bacterial infections","Upper respiratory tract infections","eye infections","certain respiratory pathogens","infants","young children","adults","wide range of respiratory pathogens","exogenous pathogens","Older children","young school children","throat","nose of healthy individuals","normal mouth flora","middle ear","eustachian tubes","different bacterial species","greater incidence of acute otitis media","good immunity","immunoglobulins","IgA","sinuses","saliva","prevention of attachment","mucous secretions","serum","lysozyme","causative organisms","year","ciliated epithelium","mucosa","viral etiology","chapter","Host defense mechanisms","average preschool child","age groups","winter","Sinusitis"],"language":"en"},

However, virus-induced changes at the sub-cellular and molecular levels are best studied in cultured cells; observations at this level can then be used to interpret changes found in whole animals. Viral cytopathology is as complex as cell biology itself; hence, it is not surprising that the subject is still largely at the descriptive level of understanding. The analysis of viral replication has been simplified at a biochemical level by the concept of strategies of viral replication; there is as yet no such unifying theme as to how DNA or RNA viruses redirect cellular metabolism and kill or transform infected cells. The chapter discusses the various types of interactions that can occur between virus and cell. Viruses may be categorized as cytocidal (lytic) and noncytocidal (nonlytic). Not all infections, whether cytocidal or noncytocidal, necessarily lead to the production of new virions. Cell changes of a profound nature, leading to cell death in some cases and cell transformation in others, may also occur in nonproductive (abortive) infections. Looked at from the point of view of the cell rather than the virus, certain kinds of cells are permissive, that is, they support complete replication of a particular virus, while others are non-permissive, that is, replication is blocked at some point. Cytopathic changes can occur in both productive and nonproductive infections and in permissive and nonpermissive cells.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

The word arbovirus is an abbreviation for arthropod-borne virus of vertebrates; it defines a concept not related to the chemical, physical, or morphological properties of the virion. Arboviruses are viruses that are maintained in nature principally, or to an important extent, through biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropods. In the strict sense, the definition of arbovirus requires that the cycle of biological propagation from arthropod to vertebrate and back to arthropod be observed under controlled conditions as it occurs in nature. Properties of a virus that are not directly related to the transmission cycle, though helpful at times for orientation, should not be entertained as defining criteria. Easy isolation and propagation by intracerebral inoculation into newborn or adult mice or the inactivation of the virus by lipid solvents are properties shared with other viruses not remotely suspected of being arthropod-borne such as herpes and rabies.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"CASALS, JORDI","journal":"Comparative Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological transmission","susceptible vertebrate hosts","cycle of biological propagation","transmission cycle","morphological properties","virus of vertebrates","nature","arboviruses","definition of arbovirus","word arbovirus","hematophagous arthropods","intracerebral inoculation","inactivation","adult mice","agency of biting","lipid solvents","Easy isolation","chemical","times","important extent","abbreviation","set","strict sense","blood","controlled conditions","epidemiologic fact","concept","orientation","virion","herpes","rabies","criteria"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, we employed cDNA microarray analysis to probe the changes in host gene transcription attributed to transfection of a codon-optimized spike construct into the HL-CZ cell line of monocyte lineage that is linked to immunological responses. A diverse representation of 100 genes displayed altered transcriptional patterns in response to SARS-CoV spike expression, with 61 upregulated and 39 downregulated genes. Genes involved in intracellular trafficking, signaling, modulation or transcription were generally upregulated. In contrast, genes involved in cell metabolism and cytoskeleton formation were notably downregulated.

For infectious diseases, one must study the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur, for these may be different. Infection is the consequence of an encounter of a potentially pathogenic microorganism with a susceptible human host through an appropriate portal of entry and usually involves a demonstrable host response to the agent. Exposure is the key factor, and the sources of infection lie mostly outside the individual human host, within the environment, or in other infected hosts. Disease represents one of the possible consequences of infection, and the factors important in its development are mostly intrinsic to the host, although the dosage and virulence of the infecting microbe play a role. These intrinsic factors include the age at the time of infection, the portal of entry, the presence or absence of immunity, the vigor of the primary defense system, the efficiency and nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the genetic makeup of the host, the state of nutrition, the presence of other diseases, and psychosocial influences. These factors that result in the occurrence of clinical illness among those infected have been called the \u201Cclinical illness-promotion factors,\u201D(3) and many of them remain unknown. The host responses can include death, the classic clinical features of the disease, mild or atypical forms, subclinical and inapparent infections, and the carrier state, which may exist in the absence of a detectable host response. While the clinician is primarily concerned with disease, the epidemiologist is interested in both infection and disease.

Here we review the concept of the dual function of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 in the light of recent strategies to use neutralization of these cytokines as potential alternative to neutralizing TNF and IL-1 treatments in chronic inflammatory disorders.

IL-17A negatively regulated dendritic cell function and activation of T helper cell (Th)2 cytokine production.

Therefore, anti-IL-17A therapy, although presenting a promising lead in chronic inflammatory disorders, bears a potential risk of exacerbating allergic asthma.","publish_time":"2012-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnyder, Bruno; Schnyder-Candrian, Silvia","journal":"IL-17, IL-22 and Their Producing Cells: Role in Inflammation and Autoimmunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dd2158790d66c5e5be4fd23817de44faa56b786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralization of IL","anti-IL","dual function of IL","chronic inflammatory disorders","s dual role","activation of T helper cell","proinflammatory role of T helper","cytokines","inhibited neutrophil recruitment","autoimmune disorders","dendritic cell function","potential alternative","potential risk","inhibited Th2-characteristic chemokine","inhibited transcription factor IRF","neutralizing TNF","allergic asthma","negative regulators","increased eosinophil recruitment","allergic lung inflammation","reduced NF-\u03BAB activation","treatments","turn","adhesion molecule expression","promising lead","antibody treatment","degradation","I\u03BAB-\u03B2","therapy","cells","light of recent strategies","cytokine production","concept","mechanistic level","evidence"],"language":"en"},

SUMMARY: Aetiological significance of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni and Parvovirus for acute enteritis in dogs A total of 179 faecal and gut contents samples from dogs (individual animals) were compared by bacteriological and virological examination. From 108 samples from dogs with severe enteritis C. f. subsp. jejuni was isolated 22 times and Parvovirus 46 times. In 13 samples both agents were found. With 54 control samples from healthy dogs C. f. subsp. jejuni was isolated in one case and Parvovirus in four. 15 of 17 dogs in a breeding kennels where acute gastroenteritis had occurred were found to be carriers of Campylobacter. Here the isolation of parvovirus succeeded in 4 cases, in three of which C. f. subsp. jejuni was also isolated. The results lead to the conclusion that both C. f. subsp. jejuni and Parvovirus play an aetiological role in acute canine gastroenteritis. The frequent simultaneous isolation of both agents in severely sick animals also suggests a synergistic effect.

RESUMEN: Sobre la significaci\u00F3n etiol\u00F3gica de Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni y del Parvovirus para las enteritis agudas del perro Se examin\u00F3 de forma comparada bacteriol\u00F3gica y virol\u00F3gicamente un total de 179 muestras de esti\u00E9rcol y contenido intestinal de perros. De 108 muestras de perros (animales individuales) con enteritis graves se logr\u00F3 aislar 22 veces Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni y 46 veces la identificaci\u00F3n del Parvovirus. En 13 casos se hallaban juntos ambos agentes etiol\u00F3gicos. Entre 54 muestras de control de perros sanos pudo aislarse C. f. ssp. jejuni en 1 caso y Parvovirus en 4 ocasiones. 15 de 17 perros de una explotaci\u00F3n zoot\u00E9cnica experimental, en la cual hab\u00EDan aparecido gastroenteritis agudas, tambi\u00E9n resultaron ser portadoras de g\u00E9rmenes Campylobacter. Aqu\u00ED se logr\u00F3 identificar el Parvovirus en 4 casos, 3 de ellos junto con C. f. ssp. jejuni. Los resultados obtenidos admiten el que se saque en conclusion que tanto C. J. ssp. jejuni como Parvovirus juegan un papel etiol\u00F3gico independiente en las gastroenteritis agudas del perro. La puesta en evidencia simult\u00E1nea, sorprendentemente tan acumulada, de ambos agentes etiol\u00F3gicos en los animales enfermos de gravedad aboga, adem\u00E1s de esto, a favor de un concurso sinerg\u00EDstico.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00FCbsamen, S.; Danner, K.; Weiss, R.","journal":"J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a813655c0d1a703c7eb86e42e5ea8b201f508a25.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Darminhaltsproben von Hunden","Proben von Hunden","von C. f. subsp","C. f. subsp","jejuni","Aqu\u00ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rolle"],"keyphrases":["jejuni in","jejuni und","parvovirus succeeded in","Parvovirus in four","cas de Parvovirus","dogs in","jejuni was isolated in","Fall und Parvovirus in","in three","acute enteritis in dogs","del Parvovirus para","identificaci\u00F3n del Parvovirus","veces Campylobacter fetus subsp","jejuni was also isolated","gelang der Parvovirusnachweis in","ssp","Parvovirus play an aetiological role in acute canine gastroenteritis","jejuni als auch Parvovirus eine eigenst\u00E4ndige \u00E4tiologische Rolle bei akuten Gastroenteritiden","in der akute Gastroenteritiden aufgetreten waren","both agents in severely sick animals also suggests","samples from dogs with severe enteritis","control samples from healthy dogs","samples both agents were found","gut contents samples from dogs","muestras","die Isolierung von","erwiesen sich ebenfalls als Tr\u00E4ger von Campylobacter","Here the isolation","enteritis agudas del perro","und Darminhaltsproben von Hunden wurden vergleichend bakteriologisch und virologisch untersucht","The results lead to the conclusion that both","were compared","con enteritis graves","The frequent simultaneous isolation","total","\u00E9chantillons de contr\u00F4le","times","\u00E9vidence fr\u00E9quente","chiens atteints","mise","fois","Hunden einer Versuchstierzucht","F\u00E4llen lagen beide Erreger gemeinsam vor","F\u00E4llen isoliert werden","\u00E9chantillons de mati\u00E8res f\u00E9cales","breeding kennels where acute gastroenteritis had occurred were found to be carriers","individual animals","Aetiological significance","gastroent\u00E9rites aigu\u00EBs","perros sanos pudo aislarse","contenu intestinal","contenido intestinal","Der auffallend geh\u00E4ufte gleichzeitige Nachweis beider Erreger bei schwer erkrankten Tieren spricht dar\u00FCber hinaus f\u00FCr ein synergistisches Zusammenwirken","schweren Enteritiden gelang","r\u00F4le \u00E9tiologique ind\u00E9pendant","propos de la signification \u00E9tiologique","Die Ergebnisse lassen den Schlu\u00DF zu","logr\u00F3 aislar","faecal","examin\u00F3","Einzeltiere","Kot","cases","da\u00DF sowohl","animales individuales","bacteriological","significaci\u00F3n etiol\u00F3gica","comparada bacteriol\u00F3gica","synergistic effect","Hundes spielen","malades","casos","hallaban juntos ambos agentes etiol\u00F3gicos","germes","virol\u00F3gicamente","Kontrollproben gesunder Hunde konnte","esti\u00E9rcol","Keimen","atteinte de gastroent\u00E9rite aigu\u00EB","davon","Zusammenfassung Insgesamt","animaux","virological examination","grave ent\u00E9rite","SUMMARY","which","action commune synergique","RESUMEN","\u00E9levage d\u0027exp\u00E9rience","bact\u00E9riologiquement","bonne","virologiquement","R\u00C9SUM\u00C9","ocasiones","r\u00E9sultats","gastroenteritis agudas del perro","logr\u00F3 identificar el Parvovirus","jejuni como Parvovirus juegan","cual hab\u00EDan aparecido gastroenteritis agudas","Los resultados obtenidos admiten el","los animales enfermos","papel etiol\u00F3gico independiente","tambi\u00E9n resultaron ser portadoras","ambos agentes etiol\u00F3gicos","sorprendentemente tan acumulada","gravedad aboga","adem\u00E1s","una explotaci\u00F3n zoot\u00E9cnica experimental","esto","evidencia simult\u00E1nea","g\u00E9rmenes Campylobacter","favor","perros","puesta","ellos junto con"],"language":"fr"},

All patients had nasopharyngeal and throat swabs taken for respiratory virus antigen detection, culture and RT\u2010PCR. All patients had pulmonary function tests at regular intervals for 12 months. Rates of rejection, decline in forced expiratory volume (L) in 1 s (FEV\u20101) and bacterial and fungal superinfection were compared at the 3\u2010month primary endpoint. In the 50 patients with RTI, a microbial etiology was identified in 33 of 50 (66%) and included rhinovirus (9), coronavirus (8), RSV (6), influenza A (5), parainfluenza (4) and human metapneumovirus (1). During the 3\u2010month primary endpoint, 8 of 50 (16%) RTI patients had acute rejection versus 0 of 50 non\u2010RTI patients (p = 0.006).

In six of these nine patients, the decline in FEV\u20101 was sustained over a 1\u2010year period consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

Roots and leaves of the plant contain several alkaloids including tylophorine, tylophorinine and tylophrinidine. The major alkaloid, tylophorine found in T. indica possesses several properties, such as immunosuppressive, antitumour, antifeedant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, diuretic and hepatoprotective activities. In addition to this, tylophorine provides positive stimulation to adrenal cortex. Biotechnological production of tylophorine was fulfilled by inducing hairy roots mediated by Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A4 strain). It was followed by its growth in liquid suspension culture that could yield maximum biomass and tylophorine production. This type of liquid suspension culture yielded 9.8 \u00B1 0.21 mgL(\u22121) tylophorine within 4\u20136 weeks of incubation. Maceration technique employed for the extraction of tylophorine was the most viable and efficient protocol. Although many reports are available regarding the biotechnological production of tylophorine, its competent and economic production still continues as a problematic issue.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cyriac, Angeline; Thomas, Toji; Thomas, T.

The proposed surgical options are as follows: (1) staged procedure with elephant trunk (ET) technique, (2) traditional frozen elephant trunk (FET) intervention, and (3) beating heart cerebral vessel debranching followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, a marked enlargement of the proximal descending thoracic aorta might make it difficult to perform FET/ET intervention. Furthermore, because in conventional surgery for AAD, a prosthetic graft replacement is generally limited to the ascending aorta, and in repeat surgery, this short Dacron graft rarely provides enough room to allow a beating heart cerebral vessel debranching and obtaining a reliable landing zone for the implantation of a firmly anchored stent graft. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all the five consecutive patients treated in our institution, between 2014 and 2017, for chronic aortic dissection after successful surgical treatment of acute Type-A aortic dissection with graft replacement limited to the ascending aorta. The five patients underwent repair utilizing a modified FET technique with total aortic arch and upper descending aorta exclusion without touching the native dissected aorta. RESULTS No early- or midterm mortality was observed. Mean time interval between the initial and the reoperative procedure was 26 months (range, 3-80 months). No patient had a minor/major neurologic event. Mean circulatory arrest time was 16 minutes (range, 11-25 minutes). Mean follow-up time was 22 months (range, 9-42 months). CONCLUSIONS We report our initial experience with a modified FET technique realized by anastomosing the stent graft with the previously implanted ascending aortic graft in Hishimaru\u0027s zone 0 and by rerouting all cerebral vessels without \u0022touching\u0022 the native chronically dissected aorta. A larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will be required to confirm these initial encouraging results.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinelli, Gian Luca; Cotroneo, Attilio; Tolva, Valerio; Armienti, Felice; Bobbio, Mario; Musica, Gabriele; Visetti, Enrico; Tesler, Ugo Filippo","journal":"Aorta","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FET"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ascending aorta","implanted ascending aortic graft","native dissected aorta","months","acute aortic dissection","chronic aortic dissection","thoracic endovascular aortic repair","modified FET technique","proximal descending thoracic aorta","prosthetic graft replacement","anchored stent graft","range","upper descending aorta exclusion","total aortic arch","short Dacron graft","Mean follow-up time","Mean time interval","beating heart cerebral vessel debranching","AAD","BACKGROUND Repeat surgery","initial experience","conventional surgery","cerebral vessels","ET intervention","consecutive patients","initial encouraging results","minutes","circulatory arrest time","larger number of patients","successful surgical treatment of acute Type","Hishimaru\u0027s zone","traditional frozen elephant trunk","reoperative procedure","longer follow-up","reliable landing zone","proposed surgical options","implantation","room","marked enlargement","minor","TEVAR","major neurologic event","midterm mortality","institution","CONCLUSIONS","challenge","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluates physiologic variables and comprehensive echocardiographic indices of RV and right atrial (RA) function following rapid ascent to high altitude. METHODS Fifty healthy volunteers actively ascended from 1130 to 4559 m in \u003C 22 h. All participants underwent 2D echocardiography during baseline examination at low altitude (424 m) and at three study time-points (7, 20 and 44 h) after arrival at high altitude. In addition to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), comprehensive 2D planimetric-, tissue Doppler- and speckle-tracking-derived strain indices of RA and RV function were obtained. RESULTS sPAP increased from baseline (24 \u00B1 4 mmHg) to the first altitude examination (39 \u00B1 8 mmHg, p \u003C 0.001) and remained elevated during the following 44 h. Global RV function did not change. RA reservoir strain showed a trend towards increase from baseline (50.2 \u00B1 12.1%) to the first altitude examination (53.8 \u00B1 11.0%, p = 0.07) secondary to a significant increase of RA contraction strain (19.2 \u00B1 6.4 vs. 25.4 \u00B1 9.6%, p \u003C 0.001). Volumetric RA data largely paralleled RA strain results and RA active emptying volume was increased throughout the 44 h stay at high altitude. CONCLUSION Active and rapid ascent of healthy individuals to 4559 m is associated with an increased contractile performance of the RA that compensates for the increased workload of the RV.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sareban, Mahdi; Perz, Tabea; Macholz, Franziska; Reich, Bernhard; Schmidt, Peter; Fried, Sebastian; Mairb\u00E4url, Heimo; Berger, Marc M; Niebauer, Josef","journal":"The international journal of cardiovascular imaging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-020-01803-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RA","h.

Since at present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of this disease include quarantine. Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind. The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint. One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread. With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt \u0022classical\u0022 preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease. Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic.

However, they require modifications to authoring and editorial processes and pose technical and publishing challenges. Several teams within Cochrane and the international Living Evidence Network have been piloting living systematic reviews. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation with participants involved in six LSRs (three Cochrane and three non-Cochrane). Up to three semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 participants involved with one or more of the pilot LSRs. Interviews explored participants\u0027 experiences contributing to the LSR, barriers and facilitators to their conduct and opportunities for future development. Pilot team members also completed monthly surveys capturing time for key tasks and the number of citations screened for each review. RESULTS Across the pilot LSRs, search frequency was monthly to three-monthly, with some using tools such as machine learning and Cochrane Crowd to screen searches. Varied approaches were used to communicate updates to readers. The number of citations screened varied widely between the reviews, from three to 300 citations per month. The amount of time spent per month by the author team on each review also varied from 5 min to 32 h. Participants were enthusiastic to be involved in the LSR pilot. They highlighted the importance of a motivated and well-organised team; the value of technology enablers to improve workflow efficiencies; the need to establish reliable and efficient processes to sustain living reviews; and the potential for saving time and effort in the long run. Participants highlighted challenges with the current publication processes, managing ongoing workload and the lack of resources to support LSRs in the long term. CONCLUSIONS Findings to date support feasibility and acceptability of LSR production. There are challenges that need to be addressed for living systematic reviews to be sustainable and have maximum value. The findings from this study will be used in discussions with the Cochrane community, key decision makers and people more broadly concerned with LSRs to identify and develop priorities for scale-up.","publish_time":"2019-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Millard, Tanya; Synnot, Anneliese; Elliott, Julian; Green, Sally; McDonald, Steve; Turner, Tari","journal":"Systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1248-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31837703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["international Living Evidence Network","LSR"],"locations":["Cochrane"],"keyphrases":["pilot LSRs","living reviews","systematic reviews","LSR pilot","Cochrane community","Cochrane Crowd","time","non-Cochrane","Pilot team members","reliable evidence","international Living Evidence Network","number of citations","efficient processes","editorial processes","author team","publishing challenges","need","Varied approaches","current publication processes","well-organised team","date support feasibility","acceptability of LSR production","high-quality evidence synthesis","key tasks","monthly surveys","maximum value","CONCLUSIONS Findings","long run","long term","key decision makers","value of technology enablers","mixed-methods evaluation","semi-structured interviews","ongoing workload","improved quality of care","machine learning","conduct","workflow efficiencies","people","patient health outcomes","screen searches","lack of resources","search frequency","opportunities","facilitators","barriers","tools","effort","discussions","potential","participants\u0027 experiences","future development","practice","importance","updates","policy","RESULTS","teams","BACKGROUND","study","modifications","priorities","scale","readers"],"language":"en"},

The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect this variant. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30 bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variant as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Siu-Ying; Wang, Pui; Mok, Bobo Wing-Yee; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Deng, Shaofeng; Chen, Pin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Song, Wenjun; Chen, Zhiwei; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Honglin","journal":"Emerging microbes \u0026 infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1756700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["additional SARS-CoV","E6 cultured SARS-CoV","emergence of SARS","mut variant","exact origin of SARS","S1","Infection of hamsters","series of variants","S2 junction region","unique cleavage motif","permissive Vero-E6 cells","distinct motif","wild type virus infection","bp deletions","body weight loss","plaque purification of Vero","positive clinical specimens","original clinical specimen","possible acquisition of cleavage site","replication","severe pathological changes","spike protein","lungs","attenuated vaccine","humans","strong selective pressure","isolate","prevalence","cross-species transmission","asymptomatic infected cases","laboratory tool","current global coronavirus pandemic","amino acids","Examination","presence","mutations","adaptive function","potential","infections"],"language":"en"},

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) emerges as a compensatory mechanism used by neurons to adjust their excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity. Recently, glial cells emerged as modulators for neurotransmission by releasing gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through pathways that include P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), connexons, and pannexons. However, the role of gliotransmission in the activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength is still an open question. Here, we investigated whether glial cells participate in HSP upon chronic inactivity and the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), connexin43 hemichannels (Cx43HCs), and pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in this process. We used immunocytochemistry against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to estimate changes in synaptic strength in hippocampal dissociated cultures. Pharmacological manipulations indicate that glial-derived ATP and P2X7R are required for HSP. In addition, inhibition of Cx43 and Panx1 channels reveals a pivotal role for these channels in the compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength, emerging as new pathways for ATP release upon inactivity. The involvement of Panx1 channels was confirmed by using Panx1-deficient animals. Lacking Panx1 in neurons is sufficient to prevent the P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength; however, the P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density requires both neuronal and glial Panx1. Together, our data supports an essential role for glial ATP signaling and Cx43HCs and Panx1 channels in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength in hippocampal cultures upon chronic inactivity.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rafael, Alberto; Cairus, Andrea; Tizzoni, Marina; Abudara, Ver\u00F3nica; Vitureira, Nathalia","journal":"Molecular neurobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-01919-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSP","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glial Panx1","compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength","glial ATP","involvement of Panx1 channels","homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength","synaptic activity","Lacking Panx1","synaptic cleft","glial cells","glial-derived ATP","activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength","P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength","Homeostatic synaptic plasticity","essential role","HSP","Panx1-deficient animals","changes","P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density","ATP release","chronic inactivity","pivotal role","role of gliotransmission","Cx43HCs","hippocampal cultures","role of adenosine triphosphate","neurons","compensatory mechanism","hippocampal dissociated cultures","new pathways","neuronal environment","key feature of neurotransmission","P2X7 receptors","connexin43 hemichannels","vGlut1","gliotransmitters","response","inhibition of Cx43","vesicular glutamate transporter","connexons","modulators","excitability","pannexin1","Pharmacological manipulations","immunocytochemistry","addition","open question","data","brain functions","pannexons","process"],"language":"en"},

However, the relationship of social capital to the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19 is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to global health and economy, for which control strategies have relied on aggressive social distancing. However, an understanding of how social capital is related to changes in human mobility patterns for adherence to social distancing is lacking. Objective: This study examines the association between state- and county-level social capital indices and community health indices in the United States, and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. It also examines changes in human mobility. Methods: Using publicly available state- and county-specific time series data for COVID-19 cases from March 13 to March 31, we used exponential fits to determine growth rate. We obtained publicly available mobility change data, originally measured from GPS-enabled mobile devices. The design was then state- and county-level correlation analysis with social capital and community health indices from the Social Capital Project (United States Senate). Results: In bivariate linear correlation analyses, we find social capital and community health indices were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates at both the state and county levels. The correlation was strongest at the county level for the community health index: a one-unit increase in the county community health index was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate exponent by 0.045. In further bivariate correlation analyses, we find that social capital indices were negatively associated with retail/recreation movement and positively associated with residential movement. That is, an increase in social capital is correlated with slower COVID-19 infection spread and more adherence to social distancing protocols. Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential benefit of incorporating social capital concepts in planning policies to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g. different social distancing requirements in different communities. The results also indicate a need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including examining interventions to increase social capital, community health, and institutional health.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varshney, L.

Here we provide a forecasting model that is based on measurable variables and that strives for simplicity over complexity to obtain stable convergent forecasts of death, prevalence, incidence, and safe days for social easing. Methods: We assume, based on prior pandemic data, that death rate rise and fall approximately follows a Gaussian distribution, which can be asymmetric, which we describe. By taking daily death data for foreign countries and U.S. states and fitting it to an appropriate Gaussian function provides an estimate of where in the cycle a particular population lies. From that time point one can integrate remaining time to obtain a final total death. By also using measured values for the time from infection to recovery or death and a mortality factor, the prevalence (active cases) and incidence (new cases) totals and rate curves can be constructed. It is also possible by setting a downward threshold on prevalence that an estimate of a minimum date to begin relaxing social restrictions may be considered. Results: To demonstrate the model we chose the most severe hot-bed countries and U.S. states as a test-bed to evolve and improve our model and to compare with other models. The model can readily be applied to other countries by inputting data from public data bases. We also compare our forecasts to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model and are reassuringly similar yet show less variability on a weekly basis. The sum of squares for error (SSE) for international and U.S. states, respectively, that we track are: 34% and 33% for our model vs. 49% and 59% for the IHME model. Conclusions: Our model appears closest to the UW IHME model; however, there are important differences and while both models forecast many of the same results of interest, each one offers unique benefits that the other does not. We believe that the model reported here excels for its simplicity, which makes the model easy to use.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Syage, J.

This study estimates the economic burden of COVID-19 in 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China between January and March 2020. Methods The healthcare and societal cost of COVID-19 was estimated using bottom-up approach. The main cost components included identification, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, compulsory quarantine and productivity losses for all affected residents in China during the study period. Input data were obtained from government reports, clinical guidelines, and other published literature. The primary outcomes were total health and societal costs. Costs were reported in both RMB and USD (2019 value). Outcomes The total estimated healthcare and societal cost associated with the outbreak is 4.26 billion RMB (0.62 billion USD) and 2,647 billion RMB (383 billion USD), respectively. The main components of routine healthcare costs are inpatient care (41.0%) and medicines (30.9%). The main component of societal costs is productivity losses (99.8%). Hubei province incurred the highest healthcare cost (83.2%) whilst Guangdong province incurred the highest societal cost (14.6%).

Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether the mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused these strains more infectious, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the binding affinity between the mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to date and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of global SARS-CoV-2 strains, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 9 mutant types under high positive selection pressure. Three mutant types (V367F, W436R, and D364Y) emerging in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and France, displayed higher human ACE2 affinity, and probably higher infectivity. This is due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. High frequencies of RBD mutations were identified: V367F from five France and one Hong Kong mutants, 13 V483A and 7 G476S mutants from the U.S.A. This suggested they originated as novel sub-lineages. The enhancement of the binding affinity of the mutant type (V367F) was further validated by the receptor-ligand binding ELISA assay. The molecular dynamics simulations also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure. An enhancement of the SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor reveals higher infectivity of the mutant strains. Importance A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused these strains more infectious, should be paid more attentions to. Here, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 9 mutant types under high positive selection pressure, suggesting they originated as novel sub-lineages. Three mutant types displayed higher human ACE2 affinity, and probably higher infectivity, one of which (V367F) was validated by wet bench.

Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19. However, China\u0027s unprecedented large-scale travel restrictions quickly reduced R_c.

However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhaowei; Hu, Jijia; Zhang, Zongwei; Jiang, Shan; Han, Shoumeng; Yan, Dandan; Zhuang, Ruhong; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Zhan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23e7355b5e4e0209f64c9d8d5772092a53b72686.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ","TTCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ group","treatment of patients","HCQ treatment group","control group","COVID","day HCQ","effect of HCQ","use of HCQ","larger proportion of patients","parallel-group trial","TTCR","clinical recovery","body temperature recovery time","cough remission time","clinical characteristics","improved pneumonia","absorption of pneumonia","mean age","mild adverse reactions","sex distribution","radiological results","baseline","severe illness","Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University","difference","antagonism","days","efficacy of hydroxychloroquine","Studies","female","Key findings","evidence","effects","Significance","Main methods","study","participants","years"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 and self-reported sudden-onset olfactory dysfunction were recruited through a public call for participation from the University of Mons. Demographic data, pathologic conditions, general and otolaryngological symptoms were collected, and general nasal complaints were evaluated with the sino-nasal outcome-22 (SNOT-22). Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements. Objective olfactory status was evaluated using an objective psychophysical test (Identification Sniffin Stick test). Results : 86 patients completed the study. The mean age was 42 \u002B or - 12 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue (75%), headache (63%), nasal obstruction (58%), dysgeusia (51%), postnasal drip (49%), cough (49%) and myalgia (46%). On NHNES, total loss of taste and smell were reported by 51% and 74% of patients, respectively. 65% of patients reported a total loss of smell, while the remainder reported a partial loss. Objective olfactory testing found 41 anosmic (48%), 12 hyposmics (14%), and 33 normosmics (38%) patients. There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip, these complaints were absent in 69% of anosmic patients. Conclusion : A significant proportion of patients reporting olfactory dysfunction related to COVID-19 infection do not have olfactory dysfunction on objective testing. Furthermore, a majority of those with measured olfactory dysfunction did not have corresponding nasal obstruction.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cabaraux, P.; Lechien, J.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear. Methods Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Findings In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8\u002B/-10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p\u003C0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Interpretation Higher inflammatory markers, more superimposed infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI therapy. Despite the confounding factors, this study suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized clinical trials will be key.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quartuccio, L.; Sonaglia, A.; McGonagle, D.; Fabris, M.; Peghin, M.; Pecori, D.; De Monte, A.; Bove, T.; Curcio, F.; Bassi, F.; De Vita, S.; Tascini, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/492e510910d3e9c90648a28a96a9d91b936b456d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20078360v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TOCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TOCI ventilated patients","ventilated TOCI cases","TOCI therapy","TOCI group","non-ventilated TOCI patients","severe cases","Anti-cytokine treatments","higher markers","anti-viral therapy","standard of care patients","consecutive hospitalized patients","higher neutrophils","cytokine storm","higher baseline CRP","Interpretation Higher inflammatory markers","therapy time","COVID","serious bacterial superinfection","bacterial complications","SOC","raised CRP","life-threatening pneumonia","lower lymphocyte levels","single centre retrospective study","superimposed infections","adverse prognostic features","worse outcomes","noninvasive ventilation","clinical trials","tocilizumab","ward","optimal patient selection","setting of increased inflammation","elevations","improvement","groups","fatalities","coronavirus disease","confounding factors","ventilators","Findings","fatality","glucocorticoids","Background","deaths","days","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The Ongoing lockdown 3.0 is over on May 18th, 2020. We derived how the lockdown relaxation is going to impact on containment of the outbreak. Here the Exponential Growth Model has been used to derive the epidemic curve based on the data collected from February 11th 2020, to May 11th 2020, and the Machine Learning based Linear Regression model that gives the epidemic curve to predict the cases with the continuous flow of the lockdown. We estimate that if the lockdown is continuing with more relaxation, then the estimated infected cases reach up to 1.16 crores by June 30th 2020, and the lockdown would persist with current restriction, then the expected predicted infected cases are 5.69 lacs. The Exponential Growth Model and the Linear Regression Model are advantageous to predict the number of affected cases of COVID-19. These models can be used for forecasting in long term intervals.

Conclusions and relevance: vitamin D deficiency is a possible risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in males. Vitamin D supplementation might be an inexpensive, accessible and safe mitigation for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Smet, D.; De Smet, K.; Herroelen, P.; Gryspeerdt, S.; Martens, G.

However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value \u003E 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions. Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system (FAM/HEX/CY5/ROX) is able to detect more target genes in a single multiplex assay, providing quantitative count of viral load in specimens, which is a powerful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Renfei; Wang, Jian; Li, Min; Wang, Yaqi; Dong, Jia; Cai, Weihua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/218ff40b1e8c25b1b9339d6138d15b404036f4b8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US CDC","CDC","Digital PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["clinical RT-PCR detection","RT-PCR tests","RT-PCR assay","RT-PCR method","Digital PCR","dPCR results","positive samples","PCR reactions","False negative detection","negative results","false positive results","clinical detection","RT-PCR grey area","inadequate detection sensitivity of RT","infected patients","dPCR methods","subject patients","asymptomatic patients","suspected patients","false positive rate","negative pharyngeal swab samples","clinical specimens","Inaccurate results","diagnosis of COVID","existing issues of RT","N gene positive","overall accuracy of dPCR","high false negative rate","negative control sample","high sensitivity RNA detection method","nucleic acid detection","improved lower limit of detection","monitoring COVID","inaccurate test results","low viral load specimens","accurate COVID","Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system","insufficient sample loading","ORFA1ab gene","Delayed diagnosis","residual SARS-CoV","clear viral loading decrease","quantitative count of viral load","human RNA","RNA degradation","multiple tests","sample handling process","N genes","powerful tool","assay kits","best treatment time window","internal reference gene","single multiplex assay","local CDC","target genes","US CDC","China FDA","useful tool","health care system","Double-blinded experiment data","FAM","example","blood","HEX","stool","instrument DropX","CY5","difficulty","different days","Ct value","ROX","criteria","Conclusions","need","hospitalization","Nantong","virus","study","Background","evidences","total","investigation","case"],"language":"en"},

In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) \u0022mitigation\u0022, which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) \u0022suppression\u0022, aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months).","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brett, T.; Rohani, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76a1a3f4055df0fd3d7041316d7d8ba48ac98b12.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.29.20082065v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","social distancing measures","extent of social distancing","endogenous transmission","transmission rates","age-structured transmission model","narrow range","multiple countries","herd immunity","range of public health strategies","range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios","non-pharmaceutical interventions","target population","period of months","affected countries","unlikely balancing of multiple","differing age groups","practical objective","time","sufficient level","unfeasible way","defined forces","susceptible depletion","rapid growth","cases of COVID","healthcare systems","UK","virus","disease burden","long duration","prospects of success","categories","response","modelling","approaches","mitigation","suppression"],"language":"en"},

This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This can be deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic.

However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Hao; Yan, Huili","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/815745bf1b522d33fd7371cc9a6561a2a93ef87e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR","EIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SEIR model","nCoV","infected individuals","future trend of epidemic spreading","future spread","spreading trend","infected patient","epidemic of new coronavirus","traditional transmission model","strong measures","accurate infected population","estimating infected populations","spread characters","strong quarantine measures","control measures","incubation individuals","exposed individual","novel EIR compartment system dynamics model","strong prevention interventions","future development","different prevention policy scenarios","date of prevention policy","epidemics","official reported data","latest reported official data","different quarantine rate","basic reproduction number","basic parameters","Chinese government","possibility of infectiousness","free propagation phase","action","response","trends","close contact","symptoms","processes","existing literatures","phases","external icon","size"],"language":"en"},

The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e., operating room).

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future. Results Here we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches. Conclusions Simulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hellewell, Joel; Abbott, Sam; Gimma, Amy; Bosse, Nikos I; Jarvis, Christopher I; Russell, Timothy W; Munday, James D; Kucharski, Adam J; Edmunds, W John; working group, CMMID nCoV; Funk, Sebastian; Eggo, Rosalind M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cc809ed4d5c3640ee2351fdb1876e8ff6c01b51.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation of cases","symptom onset","number of initial cases","proportion of transmission","fewer cases","imported cases","little transmission","large initial number of cases","case isolation","viability of isolation","stochastic transmission model","low contact tracing probability","higher R0","nCoV outbreak","weekly maximum number of cases","different initial numbers of cases","potential effectiveness of contact tracing","updated transmission characteristics","higher values of R0","basic reproduction number R0","lower values of R0","new outbreak","specific definitions of outbreak control","majority of outbreaks","success of controlling outbreaks","probability contacts","probability of control decreases","simulated outbreaks","majority of scenarios","delay","potential success of local response efforts","proportion of subclinical infections","prospects","largest role","weeks","feasibility of public health effort","Findings","Methods","total","symptoms","Background","pathogen","months","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen (nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 \u03BCM. Our in-house developed device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples.

Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of 8,405 genes linked with 35,074 human-specific neuro-regulatory single-nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) revealed a staggering breadth of significant associations with morphological structures, physiological processes, and pathological conditions of Modern Humans. Significantly enriched traits include more than 1,000 anatomically-distinct regions of the adult human brain, many different types of cells and tissues, more than 200 common human disorders and more than 1,000 records of rare diseases. Thousands of genes connected with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs have been identified, which represent essential genetic elements of the autosomal inheritance and offspring survival phenotypes. A total of 1,494 hsSNC- linked genes are associated with either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and 2,273 hsSNC-linked genes have been associated with premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as pre-, peri-, neo-, and post-natal lethality phenotypes of both complete and incomplete penetrance. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify 7,990 genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS), expression of a majority of which (5,389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). Interrogations of the MGI database revealed readily available mouse models tailored for precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs and SCARS on genes causally affecting thousands of mammalian phenotypes and implicated in hundreds of common and rare human disorders. These observations suggest that a preponderance of human-specific traits evolved under a combinatorial regulatory control of HSRS and neuro-regulatory loci harboring hsSNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in differentially-accessible chromatin regions during brain development.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glinsky, Gennadi V.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c5828232ed9c1c5f0c69fb6199fce64e9605d3f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/848762","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Modern Humans","GSEA","MGI","HSRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated genes","hsSNC- linked genes","hsSNC-linked genes","Thousands of genes","specific regulatory sequences","neuro-regulatory hsSNCs","characterization of human","preponderance of human","neuro-regulatory loci","common human disorders","rare human disorders","specific regulatory DNA sequences","adult human brain","human-specific neuro-regulatory single-nucleotide changes","hsSNC-linked loci","specific traits","evolutionary distinct classes of human","combinatorial regulatory control of HSRS","distinct regions","autosomal inheritance","retroviral sequences","thousands of mammalian phenotypes","SCARS","pathology of Modern Humans","post-natal lethality phenotypes","pathological conditions of Modern Humans","offspring survival phenotypes","precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs","recessive inheritance","brain development","embryonic lethality","hundreds of common","Differential GSEA","enriched traits","accessible chromatin regions","records of rare diseases","Gene set enrichment analyses","morphological structures","physiological processes","available mouse models","staggering breadth of significant associations","physiology","stage","different types of cells","MGI database","global impact","assessment","tissues","identification","premature death","essential genetic elements","expression","Recent advances","stem cell","incomplete penetrance","majority","total","Interrogations","observations","primates"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time. METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-19 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques. RESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease around 11/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term antiviral mask in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia SARS-CoV-2 as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarynowski, A.; Wojta-Kempa, M.; Belik, V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e2f38edffadb453c89c9181b28d4d25478deb15.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20090993v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["social media","traditional media","Internet media","perception of COVID","traditional news media","Social distancing","electronic media","social perception of coronavirus","Risk perception","epidemic perception","public perception","topic COVID","Poland","actual physical risk of acquiring COVID","Polish society","Traditional news agencies","Google","Polish prime minister","Wikipedia SARS-CoV","actual risk of acquiring infection","Polish government","Twitter","disease","public information campaigns","quick dissemination of information","official introduction","study","anti-crisis legislation","Anti-crisis shield","minister of health","quantitative analysis","highest attention of Internet users","related behaviour","spread of SARS","real time","greater impact","present trend analysis","official incidence series","declarations of mitigation strategies","massive mitigation program","colloquial searching term antiviral mask","encyclopaedic definition","main issues","medical commutation","different mechanisms","knowledge","platforms","YouTube","negative correlations","digital footprints","support of natural language processing techniques","virus responsible","Lockdown","local peaks","additional phases","temporal major clusters","signal report","Event Registry","urgent need","Restrictions","war","CONCLUSIONS","exponential increase","RESULTS","decay","Chinese","Mitigations","reality","force events","Italian","METHODS","extent"],"language":"en"},

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Shengjie; Bogoch, Isaac; Ruktanonchai, Nick; Watts, Alexander; Lu, Xin; Yang, Weizhong; Yu, Hongjie; Khan, Kamran; Tatem, Andrew J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/013d9d1cba8a54d5d3718c229b812d7cf91b6c89.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Lunar New Year"],"locations":["Wuhan City","Wuhan","China","Asia","Europe","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan City","mainland China","nCoV infection","lockdown of Wuhan","neighbouring cities","significant spread","cordon sanitaire of Wuhan","geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus","international exportation","origin high-risk cities","international travel network-based connectivity","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","air passenger itinerary data","travel reduction","risk analyses","human transmission","potential risk","outbreak of human","air passengers","World Health Organization","aggregated mobile phone data","large number of airline travellers","predicted importation risks","destinations","strong correlation","series of domestic","Lunar New Year","Europe","Asia","LNY","stages of peak population numbers","major hubs","case reports","Australia","reported cases","globe","weeks","normal volumes","scenario","Results","megacities","vulnerable regions","countries","months","Methods","current extent","majority","Background","efforts","end","UI","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Exogenous surfactant therapy has not reduced ARDS mortality. Sulforhodamine B (SRB), which acts with albumin to improve native lung surfactant efficacy, could be an alternative T-lowering therapeutic. We test whether substances suspected of elevating T in ARDS raise T in the lungs \u2013 where, unlike in most in vitro tests, the surfactant monolayer is intact \u2013 and test the abilities of exogenous surfactant and SRB to reduce T. METHODS In isolated rat lungs, we micropuncture a surface alveolus and instill a solution containing a substance purported to raise T in ARDS: control saline, cell debris, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), acid or mucins. We test each substance alone; with albumin, to model proteinaceous edema liquid; with albumin and subsequent exogenous surfactant; or with albumin and SRB. We determine T by combining servo-nulling pressure measurement with confocal microscopy, and applying the Laplace relation. RESULTS In the control group, saline, albumin and Infasurf do not alter T; SRB reduces T below normal. With albumin, the experimental substances raise T. With cell debris, surfactant does not alter T; SRB normalizes T. With sPLA2, surfactant normalizes T; SRB reduces T. With acid or mucins, neither surfactant nor SRB alters T. CONCLUSIONS The inability of surfactant to counter cell debris may contribute to the failure of surfactant therapy for ARDS. For non-aspiration ARDS, SRB, which can be delivered intravascularly to target injured lung regions, holds promise as a treatment. Summary In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), surface tension, T, is believed to be elevated and surfactant therapy has failed to reduce mortality. Here, we test whether various substances suggested to contribute to elevated T in ARDS in fact raise T in the lungs. And we test the ability of exogenous surfactant and of a potential alternative therapeutic, sulforhodamine B (SRB), to reduce T. We find exogenous surfactant unable to lower T in the presence of cell debris but SRB, which can be administered intravascularly, a candidate for lowering T in non-aspiration ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Tam L.; Perlman, Carrie E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc0a773f2d7e07d877d2fd3db7839dda64874651.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sulforhodamine"],"organizations":["ARDS","SRB","T.

First, the spread of SARS-COV-2 has produced population specific lineages; second, epidemic spread model parameters are tied directly to these physiological and demic rates (e. g. incubation time, recovery time, transmission rate); and third, these parameters may serve as novel phenotypes to associate with region-specific genetic mutations as well as demic characteristics (e. g. age structure, cultural observance of personal space, crowdedness). Therefore, we sought to understand whether the parameters of epidemic models could be determined from the trajectory of infections, recovery, and hospitalizations prior to peak, and also to evaluate the quality and comparability of data between jurisdictions reporting their statistics necessary for the analysis of model parameters across populations. We found that, analytically, the pre-peak growth of an epidemic is limited by a subset of the model variates, and that the rate limiting variables are dominated by the expanding eigenmode of their equations. The variates quickly converge to the ratio of eigenvector components of the positive growth rate, which determines the doubling time. There are 9 parameters and 4 independent components in the eigenmode, leaving 5 undetermined parameters. Those parameters can be strikingly population dependent, and can have significant impact on estimates of hospital loads downstream. Without a sound framework, measurements of infection rates and other parameters are highly corrupted by uneven testing rates to uneven counting and reporting of relevant values. From the standpoint of phenotype parameters, this means that structured experiments must be performed to estimate these parameters in order to perform genetic association studies, or to construct viable models that accurately predict critical quantities such as hospitalization loads.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Platt, Daniel E; Parida, Laxmi E; Zalloua, Pierre","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1e789ce7be399ec9901b0ee90a9dcbe2c77e80b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20071928v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["demic parameters","undetermined parameters","parameters of epidemic models","analysis of model parameters","epidemic spread model parameters","standpoint of phenotype parameters","demic rates","recovery time","epidemic modeling","model variates","genetic association studies","uneven testing rates","demic characteristics","incubation time","transmission rate","positive growth rate","population dependent","doubling time","measurements of infection rates","region-specific genetic mutations","population specific lineages","pre-peak growth","uneven counting","novel way","novel phenotypes","viable models","independent components","expanding eigenmode","spread of SARS","hospitalization loads","ratio of eigenvector components","reporting of relevant values","age structure","cultural observance of personal space","statistics necessary","jurisdictions","critical quantities","significant impact","epidemiological study level","comparability of data","crowdedness","sound framework","order","estimates of hospital","quality","trajectory of infections","hospitalizations","variables","populations","subset","structured experiments","equations","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and strategies to improve therapeutic opportunities require deeper understanding of the molecular processes of the normal heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavor. Here, using large-scale single cell and nuclei transcriptomic profiling together with state-of-the-art analytical techniques, we characterise the adult human heart cellular landscape covering six anatomical cardiac regions (left and right atria and ventricles, apex and interventricular septum). Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, revealing distinct subsets in the atria and ventricles indicative of diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. Further we define the complexity of the cardiac vascular network which includes clusters of arterial, capillary, venous, lymphatic endothelial cells and an atrial-enriched population. By comparing cardiac cells to skeletal muscle and kidney, we identify cardiac tissue resident macrophage subsets with transcriptional signatures indicative of both inflammatory and reparative phenotypes. Further, inference of cell-cell interactions highlight a macrophage-fibroblast-cardiomyocyte network that differs between atria and ventricles, and compared to skeletal muscle.

At the moment there is no available drug(s) and vaccine(s) for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

In the present in silico study, a library of 22 phytochemicals with antiviral activity obtained from PubChem Database was screened for activity against 6lu7 and 6vsb with the PyRX software. Six lead compounds with binding energies within the range of \u22129 to \u22129.6 Kcal/mol were selected for molecular docking analyses against 6lu7. SwissADMET and Molinspiration Cheminformatics for CLogP (mean range of 0.77-8.72) of the lead compounds showed no correlation observed between lipophilicity and interaction with receptors and all the compounds except for baicalin exhibited drug-like properties based on Lipinski and Veber filter. The ADMET profile showed that lead compounds lack hepatotoxicity and mutagenicity effects while they show variable immunotoxicity, carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity.

Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Method Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. Results Using spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control - among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a \u201Ctrace \u0026 isolate\u201D approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a \u201Ctrace \u0026 isolate\u201D approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific take-up rates for tracing apps.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grimm, Veronika; Mengel, Friederike; Schmidt, Martin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33e6bc5c5574fb314db82f38bf7fe0467efb9a17.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078113v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protection of vulnerable groups","group-specific protection","tailored measures of epidemic control","different take-up rates of tracing apps","different goals of epidemic control","group-specific take-up rates","reliable health protection","use of tracing apps","different infectiousness parameters","large number of groups","interplay of group","lethality rates","health system","high death toll","trace","epidemiological SEIR model","isolate","approach","specific social distancing","public health interventions","low death toll","combination of tailored mechanisms","high compliance","underlying parameters","age differentiation","sharp trade-offs","detailed analysis","case study","scenarios","effectiveness","overload","challenge","hospitalization","behavioral response","pandemic","extension","short duration","key insight","COVID","governments","results","economic activity","strict isolation","context","paper"],"language":"en"},

As of May 10, 2020, it has caused an outbreak with more than 41,78,000 confirmed infections and more than 2,83,000 reported deaths globally. Due to the unavailability of an effective treatment (or vaccine) and insufficient evidence regarding the transmission mechanism of the epidemic, the world population is currently in a vulnerable position. The daily cases data sets of COVID-19 for profoundly affected countries represent a stochastic process comprised of deterministic and stochastic components. This study proposes an integrated deterministic-stochastic approach to predict the long-term trajectories of the COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain. The deterministic component of the daily-cases univariate time-series is assessed by an extended SIR (SIRCX) model whereas its stochastic component is modeled using an autoregressive (AR) time series model. The proposed integrated SIRCX-AR (ISA) approach based on two operationally distinct modeling paradigms utilizes the superiority of both the deterministic SIRCX and stochastic AR models to find the long-term trajectories of the epidemic curves. Experimental analysis based on the proposed ISA model suggests that the estimated numbers of cases in Italy and Spain between 11 May, 2020 -- 09 June, 2020 will be 10982 (6383--15582) and 13731 (3395--29013), respectively. Additionally, the expected number of daily cases on 09 July, 2020 for Italy and Spain are estimated to be 30 (0--183) and 92 (0--602), respectively. These log-term forecasts for Italy and Spain of the coming outbreaks will be very useful for the effective allocation of health care resources to mitigate COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakraborty, T.; Ghosh, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49792ca9fadfefe2ac67eb953b763f830de494d1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20101303v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISA"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["Italy","Spain","deterministic SIRCX","integrated deterministic-stochastic approach","stochastic AR models","stochastic process","stochastic components","deterministic component","daily cases data sets of COVID","estimated numbers of cases","daily-cases univariate time-series","proposed integrated SIRCX-AR","expected number of daily cases","ongoing COVID","proposed ISA model","time series model","long-term trajectories","effective treatment","epidemic curves","world population","effective allocation of health care resources","major health emergencies","superiority","insufficient evidence","transmission mechanism","decades","vaccine","pandemic","coming outbreaks","extended SIR","distinct modeling paradigms","log-term forecasts","confirmed infections","Experimental analysis","countries","study","reported deaths","vulnerable position","country","unavailability"],"language":"en"},

Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juno, J.

In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities (38%-168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sol\u00EDs, Patricio; Carre\u0148o, Hiram","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4a0ebbfb08416599e2cc830825ea78cb23f7a2b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074591v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["fatality risks","related fatality risk","estimated fatality risk","final fatality risk","case fatality rate","high COVID","confirmed patients","high selectivity","symptomatic patients","deceased patients","Mexico","high prevalence of chronic","self-selectivity","younger age structure","testing","individual-level data","survival analysis methods","days of onset","degenerative diseases","deaths","cross-sectional counts","world","Coronavirus","individuals","time of exposure","censorship","Mexican Ministry of Health","symptoms","official statistics","males","paper","reasons","comorbidities","cases","estimates"],"language":"en"},

Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NF\u03BAB ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Mallika; Kalajzic, Ivo; Aguila, Hector Leonardo; Shapiro, Linda H","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0614543ffeb8487da9529d27916b3924f8d5fa5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.061325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MGC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell fusion events","MGC fusion","fusion progresses","CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells","bone resorption activity","enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts","fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells","endosteal bone formation rate","fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin","large cells","absence of CD13","Loss of CD13","localization of key fusion proteins","low bone density phenotype","surface of osteoclast precursor cells","specialized cell types","cells of myeloid lineage","CD13-deficient mice","increased formation of multinucleated giant cells","normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations","receptor RANK","osteoclast-specific function","expression levels","osteoclastogenesis","high levels","independent of RANKL","osteoblasts","IL","dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis","mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts","present study","soluble receptor activator of NF\u03BAB ligand","high numbers of nuclei","concomitant increase","recycling","genotypes","common pathway","DC-STAMP","defect","presence","assembly of molecular machinery","necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization","process","transmembrane aminopeptidase","CSF","vertebrates"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people.

To date, documentation of histopathologic features in fatal cases of COVID-19 has been limited due to small sample size and incomplete organ sampling. Methods Post-mortem examinations were performed on 12 fatal COVID-19 cases in Washington State during February-March 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination of all major organs was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The presence of viral RNA in sampled tissues was tested by RT-PCR. Results All 12 patients were older with significant preexisting comorbidities. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute and/or organizing phases with virus identified in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 represents the third novel coronavirus to cause widespread human disease since 2002. Similar to SARS and MERS, the primary pathology was diffuse alveolar damage with virus located in the pneumocytes. However, other major organs including the heart and kidneys may be susceptible to viral replication and damage leading to increased mortality in those with disseminated disease. Understanding the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to design effective therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradley, B.

Lockdown has dramatically slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in UK, and even more significantly, has changed the growth in the total number of infected from exponential to quadratic. This significant change is due to a transition from a mobility-driven epidemic spreading to a spatial epidemic which is dominated by slow growth of spatially isolated clusters of infected population. Our results strongly indicate that, to avoid a return to exponential growth of COVID-19 (also known as second wave), mobility restrictions should not be prematurely lifted.

Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people\u0027s movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions: The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skums, Pavel; Kirpich, Alexander; Icer Baykal, Pelin; Zelikovsky, Alex; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/188feae8d84597b98db5622d180c8754a6a6aea6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Western Europe","Australia","Canada","United States","South America","Africa"],"keyphrases":["global transmission network of SARS","transmission clusters","sustained transmission","transmission networks","SARS-CoV","heterogeneous transmission pathways","spread of SARS","spatial-temporal transmission pathways","potential transmission pairs","global spread","network structure","network-based approach","inferred network structural properties","multiple introductions of SARS","majority of world regions","global epidemiological linkage","molecular surveillance data of SARS","virus introduction routes","international spread","pandemic declaration","viral genomic variants","genomic variants responsible","comprehensive analysis","evidence-based understanding of properties","neighboring countries","geographic regions","health systems","coordinated interventions","number of severe restrictions","available temporal information","majority of possible transmissions","public health measures","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","days","Asia","sample collection times","expected sampling time difference","Australia","Western Europe","importance","extent","dynamics","substantial fraction of infected individuals","fact","attempt","Canada","people\u0027s movement","line","inference","epidemics","up-to-date picture","scale-free","United States","accumulation of mutations","mutation trees","Conclusions","South America","place efficient","Chinese government","symptoms","Methods","potent transmissibility","establishment","outbreak settings","Africa","Results","Background","COVID","areas","goal","emergence"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patients features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"ELGhamrawy, S.

Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country\u0027s population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asselta, R.; Paraboschi, E.

To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590000 and 60000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as an important functional receptor for SARS-Cov-2. ACE2 and ACE are homologues with inverse functions in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE converts angiotensin I into a vital vasoactive peptide called angiotensin II(AngII), whereas ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII into a series of vasodilators. There were few reports illustrated the expression of AngII in COVID-19. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression of angiotensin II in COVID-19 and how it correlated to the disease. Methods: We enrolled 55 patients with COVID-19 admitted to renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 21st to February 21st, 2020. Demographic data were collected upon admission. COVID-19 nuclear acid, plasma AngII, Renin and aldosterone in the lying position without sodium restriction, and other laboratory indicators were together measured by the laboratory department of our hospital. Findings: Of the 55 patients with COVID-19, 34(61.8%) had an increased level of AngII. The severity of COVID-19 and male is positively related with the level of AngII. The level of blood lymphocyte, PCT, ALT, and AST were remarkably severe with those of normal level of AngII (P \u003C 0.05). CD4/CD8 cells ratio was significantly higher whereas CD3\u002BCD8\u002B cells amount, CD3\u002BCD8\u002B cells proportion, CD56\u002BCD16\u002BCD3- cells amount and CD19\u002BCD3- cells amount were considerably lower than those of normal level of AngII (P \u003C 0.05). Abnormal rates of blood lymphocyte and PCT were significantly higher in Patients with elevated AngII level. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 (OR=4.123) and CD4/CD8 ratio(OR=4.050) were the co-directional impact factor while female(OR=0.146) was inverse impact factor of elevated AngII level. Interpretation: High rate of increased level of AngII was detected in COVID-19 patients. Patients with elevated AngII level were more likely to be critically ill with COVID-19. Considering the gender differences in ACE2 expression and no gender differences in angiotensin expression, the gender differences in AngII level might indicate less loss of ACE2 in female patients. Elevated AngII level was correlated with CD4/CD8 ratio, suggesting it might involve in immune disorder.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Three SIR models were fit to prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. Results: Presently, the COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly decelerating in NC and the Charlotte region. Infection curves are flattening at both the state and regional level. Relatively speaking, the greater Charlotte region has responded more favorably to the stay-at-home intervention than NC as a whole. While an initial basic SIR model served the purpose of informing decision making in the early days of the pandemic, its forecast increasingly did not fit the data over time. However, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model provided a good fit to the data. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to do capacity planning and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turk, P.

Model the effect of partial and full reversal of containment measures on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Ecuador. Methods. Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 before and after the implementation (and reversal) of containment measures. A Healthcare Compartmental Epidemic Model (HeCEM), which accounts for Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission rates, was developed to also simulate the effect of reversing social distancing containment measures. Reported COVID-19 cases between February 29th and April 23rd, 2020 were obtained from the Servicio Nacional de Gesti\u0026oacuten de Riesgos y Emergencia, the national emergency management office of Ecuador. An ARIMA model was used to forecast reported number of cases based on the reported number of cases. SIR, HeCEM, and ARIMA model prediction errors were estimated. Results. SIR and HeCEM models predict that, at the moment, hospital and ICU bed needs for COVID-19 patients exceed the capacity in Ecuador. Partial or full reversal of containment measures before reaching the point where hospital and ICU beds are enough to meet the expected demand will result in secondary waves that delay reaching this equilibrium, resulting in thousands of excess deaths.

Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text. Data extraction Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results 2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to \u003E 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (\u003C 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Shujuan; Zhang, Jiayue; Zeng, Minyan; Yun, Qingping; Guo, Wei; Zheng, Yixiang; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Maggie H; Yang, Zuyao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ece7750f80832bf9cc368c5138df12fd19183b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CNKI"],"locations":["China","South Korea","Vietnam","Germany","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["days","exposure period","exposure of infector","cases of COVID","estimates of serial interval","exposure date","severe cases","time point of exposure","potential exposure","longer incubation","primary cases","clustering cases","upper limit of latent period","robust estimates","incubation periods","severe disease","Asymptomatic transmission","infector-infectee pairs","key epidemiological parameters of COVID","error of estimates","accuracy of estimates","transmission order","estimation of parameters","symptom onset of infector","specific parameters","pre-symptomatic transmission","symptom onsets of infectors","day quarantine of persons","symptom onsets of infectees","relevant data","outbreak of coronavirus disease","study","R0","Findings","individual data of laboratory","consistent evidence","health authorities","outside China","appropriate models","available reports","Stratified analysis","final analysis","World Health Organization","absence of appropriate control measures","basic reproduction number","South Korea","Singapore","high risk of long-term epidemic","Vietnam","datasets","Malaysia","Japan","simple method","Weibull","gamma distributions","Germany","publications","current practice","clusters","standard deviation","results","pandemic","mean","Interpretation","total","Methods","PubMed","CNKI","selected groups","different formulas"],"language":"en"},

The envelope glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFc\u2019s capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration of AvFc was well tolerated; after 11 consecutive doses every other day at 25 mg/kg, there were no significant changes in body or liver weights, nor any impact noted in blood human albumin levels or serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology further confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-stage liver disease patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dent, Matthew; Hamorsky, Krystal; Vausselin, Thibaut; Dubuisson, Jean; Miyata, Yoshinari; Morikawa, Yoshio; Matoba, Nobuyuki","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac7815740ea4bf31331fc7c34fc9f9bed9b60b67.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056754","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMG","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","liver transplantation","liver pathology","liver weights","envelope glycoproteins of HCV","recurrent infection","cell culture-derived HCV","Systemic administration of AvFc","HCV-related end-stage liver disease patients","AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity","therapeutic potential","envelope HMGs","approved therapeutic targeting","PXB human liver chimeric mouse model","histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation","high proportion of high","promising therapeutic approach","HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein","genotype independent manner","lectibody Avaren-Fc","cell-entry receptors","blood human albumin levels","serum alanine aminotransferase activity","IC50 values","impact","studies","mortality","recent advent","interaction","mannose glycans","efficacious means","animals","AvFc\u2019s capacity","low nanomolar range","effective direct-acting antivirals","significant changes","druggable biomarker","hepatitis C virus","major cause of morbidity","neutralizing antibodies","lack of discernible toxicity","assays","Gross necropsy","treatment regimen","consecutive doses","day","shield","results"],"language":"en"},

Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection.

This document explains the main principles to consider when managing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients during evaluation as well as when surgical treatment is required.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balibrea, Jose Mose.; Badia, Josep Mose.; Rubio P\u00E9rez, In\u00E9s; Mart\u00EDn Antona, Esteban; \u00C1lvarez Pe\u00F1a, Est\u00EDbaliz; Garc\u00EDa Botella, Sandra; \u00C1lvarez Gallego, Mario; Mart\u00EDn P\u00E9rez, Elena; Mart\u00EDnez Cortijo, Sagrario; Pascual Miguela\u00F1ez, Isabel; P\u00E9rez D\u00EDaz, Lola; Ramos Rodriguez, Jose Luis; Espin Basany, Eloy; S\u00E1nchez Santos, Raquel; Soria Aledo, Victoriano; L\u00F3pez Barrachina, Ruth; Morales-Conde, Salvador","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f70e5a11e537627b9d8d6b7fe2f2080a4a344f4c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009739X20300695; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009739X20300695","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pacientes COVID","many patients with confirmed or suspected COVID","consider when managing confirmed or suspected COVID","the current pandemic of respiratory","minimize the possibility of transmission between patients","caused by the SARS","exposure of healthcare personnel and the development of postoperative complications","patients during evaluation as well as when surgical treatment","known as coronavirus","or emergency surgical treatment","numerosos pacientes","This document explains the main","virus denominado SARS","surgery that cannot be","be adopted in order","principales medidas","tratamiento quir\u00FArgico electivo inaplazable","caso de atenci\u00F3n","actual pandemia de enfermedad respiratoria denominada enfermedad","In these situations","adopci\u00F3n de medidas especiales","infection will require elective surgery","need","personal sanitario","Abstract Due","cara","exposici\u00F3n","cuenta","required","desarrollo de complicaciones postoperatorias","posibilidad de contagio","presente documento","situaciones","confirmaci\u00F3n","Resumen","evaluaci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is performed with a virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. This test can take up to two days to complete, and, due to the possibility of false negatives, serial testing may be required to reliably exclude infection. A current supply shortage of RT-PCR test kits compounds the shortcomings of entrusting diagnosis to the PCR test alone and underscores the urgent need to provide alternative methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value to fully exclude infection, because of the normal radiologic findings in some early disease patients. In this study, we use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and/or laboratory testing to more accurately and rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 (\u002B) patients. We included 905 RT-PCR confirmed patients. 419 (46.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by laboratory-confirmed real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing, while 486 patients (53.8%) tested negative (confirmed by at least two additional negative RT-PCR tests and clinical observation). The proposed AI system achieved an AUC of 0.92 and performed equally well in sensitivity compared to a senior thoracic radiologist on a testing set of 279 cases. The AI system also improved the detection of RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 patients who presented with normal CTs, correctly identifying 17/25 (68%) patients, whereas all 25 RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive CT-normal patients were classified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by radiologists.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mei, Xueyan; Lee, Hao-Chih; Diao, Kaiyue; Huang, Mingqian; Lin, Bin; Liu, Chenyu; Xie, Zongyu; Ma, Yixuan; Robson, Philip M.; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Mani, Venkatesh; Calcagno, Claudia; Li, Kunwei; Li, Shaolin; Shan, Hong; Lv, Jian; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Long, Qihua; Steinberger, Sharon; Jacobi, Adam; Deyer, Timothy; Luksza, Marta; Liu, Fang; Little, Brent P.; Fayad, Zahi A.; Yang, Yang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04e5751f0a3333da7b6053e3e9336c7710b229ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR SARS-CoV","PCR positive SARS-CoV","suspected SARS-CoV","RT-PCR assay","evaluation of patients","positive CT-normal patients","PCR test kits","additional negative RT-PCR tests","detection of RT","Laboratory confirmation of SARS","early disease patients","accurate diagnosis of SARS","laboratory testing","infection","chest CT findings","current supply shortage of RT","normal radiologic findings","serial testing","negative predictive value","proposed AI system","normal CTs","cases","clinical symptoms","clinical observation","widespread person","person transmission","coronavirus disease","shortcomings of entrusting diagnosis","Chest computed tomography","virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","exposure history","algorithms","alternative methods","urgent need","valuable component","China","senior thoracic radiologist","possibility of false negatives","artificial intelligence","generation sequencing","outbreak","Wuhan","sensitivity","countries","total","COVID","AUC","deaths","study","radiologists","days"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a data schema required for the integration can be modelled with entity schemas represented by shape expressions. As a telling example, we describe the process of aligning resources on the genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and related viruses as well as how shape expressions can be defined for Wikidata helping others studying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. How this model can be used to make data between various resources interoperable, is demonstrated by integrating data from NCBI Taxonomy, NCBI Genes, UniProt, and WikiPathways. Based on that model, a set of automated applications or bots were written for regular updates of these sources in Wikidata and added to a platform for automatically running these updates.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected lung, induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines is initially poor. When induction does occur, this may in fact exacerbate infection. These observations suggest that baseline levels of leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may be important for orchestrating an effective early immune response. Hence, we performed \u201Cin silico flow cytometry\u201D on 1,927 human lung tissues to deconvolute the levels of seven leukocyte types involved in triggering an acute anti-viral cellular immune response. Baseline levels of CD8\u002B T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated NK cells are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses that include sex, age, race, body mass index and smoking history, and in two independent datasets. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that a subgroup of individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to COVID-19 due to concomitant high pre-existing ACE2 expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duijf, Pascal H.G.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad1db5524a479cffa22857728c2c3d0d39f5fa57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human lung tissues","infected lung","SARS-CoV","coronavirus infection","Baseline levels of CD8","baseline levels of leukocytes","high expression","induction of immune cell","T cells","concomitant high pre-existing ACE2 expression","activated NK cells","low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels","Coronavirus disease","COVID","Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity","effective early immune response","acute anti-viral cellular immune response","host cell entry receptor ACE2","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","multivariate analyses","univariate analyses","detrimental human health","age","body mass index","smoking history","race","community","natural killer","economic impacts","sex","subgroup of individuals","silico flow cytometry","cytokines","leukocyte types","world","observations","independent datasets","results","fact"],"language":"en"},

This is crucial since in most places we observe significant reductions in social interaction before any policy was implemented. Variations in types and effective dates of different social distancing policies across different states in the US create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy during the early stage of the outbreak. Using these policy variations and the aggregate human mobility and location trends published by Google for the month of March 2020, we employ a quasi-experimental approach to measure the impact of six common policies on people\u0027s presence at home and their mobility in different types of public places.

They show that while strong policies such as statewide stay home mandate and non-essential business closure have strong causal impacts on reducing social interactions, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies (such as large gathering ban and school closure mandates) are already reaped from non-policy mechanisms such as voluntary actions and public awareness.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abouk, R.; Heydari, B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b52687dee16212dfe305771838975d9a9059cf3f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20057356v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strong policies","common social distancing policies","common policies","effectiveness of different policies","effective dates of different social distancing policies","lenient policies","social interactions","different states","different types of public places","non-policy mechanisms","expected impact","policy variations","voluntary actions","social contact rates","relative impact vis","public awareness","non-essential business closure","strong causal impacts","non-pharmaceutical interventions","aggregate human mobility","school closure mandates","effective antiviral medications","statewide stay home mandate","large gathering ban","location trends","people\u0027s presence","magnitude","natural experiment","significant reductions","vaccine","Google","results","early stage","absence","quasi-experimental approach","significance","outbreak","month"],"language":"en"},

One patient on hydroxychloroquine and two subjects without hydroxychloroquine were admitted to the hospital, none of them required to be transferred to the intensive care unit and no patient died during the episode. Conclusions: The incidence and severity of COVID-19 among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases with and without hydroxychloroquine was not significantly different. Hydroxychloroquine does not seem to be an appropriate therapy for post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Macias, J.; Gonzalez-Moreno, P.; Sanchez-Garcia, E.; Morillo-Verdugo, R.; Dominguez-Quesada, C.; Pinilla, A.; Macho, M.; Martinez, M.; Gonzalez-Serna, A.; Corma, A.; Real, L.

We report preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and participated in a compassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy. All 21 patients received intravenous siltuximab, a chimeric mAb that binds to and blocks the effect of IL-6, at a dose ranging between 700 to 1,200 mg (median 900 mg). The median age of patients treated was 64 years, and all patients were followed for a median of eight days. Serum CRP levels reduced in all 16 patients with available data following treatment. An improvement in the clinical condition was observed in 33% (7/21) of patients, 43% (9/21) of patients stabilized as evidenced by no clinically relevant change in their condition, and 24% (5/21) experienced a worsening in their condition. Of those patients who experienced a worsening in their condition, one patient died, and one patient experienced a cerebrovascular event.

Due to possible extreme effects, such as hospitals potentially running out of beds or medical equipment, it is essential to lower the infection rate to create enough space to attend to the affected people and allow enough time for a vaccine to be developed. Unfortunately, this requires that measures put into place are upheld long enough to reduce the infection rate sufficiently. In this paper, we describe research simulating the influences of the contact rate on the spread of the pandemic using New York City as an example (Section IV) and especially already observed effects of contact rate increases during holidays [2-4] (Section V). In multiple simulations scenarios for Passover and Easter holidays, we evaluated 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% temporary increases in contact rates using a scenario close to the currently reported numbers as reference and contact rates based on bioterrorism research as a \u0027normal\u0027 baseline for NYC. The first general finding from the simulations is that singular events of increased visits/contacts amplify each other disproportionately if they are happening in close proximity (time intervals) together. The second general observation was that contact rate spikes leave a permanently increased and devastating infection rate behind, even after the contact rate returns to the reduced one. In case of a temporary sustained increase of contact rate for just three days in a row, the aftermath results in an increase of infection rate up to 40%, which causes double the fatalities in the long run. In numbers, given that increases of 25% and 50% seem to be most likely given the data seen in Germany for the Easter weekend for example [2, 3], our simulations show the following increases (compared to the realistic reference run): for a temporary 25% surge in contact rate, the total cases grew by 215,880, the maximum of required hospitalizations over time increased to 63,063, and the total fatalities climbed by 8,844 accumulated over 90 days. As for the 50% surge, we saw the total number of cases rise by 461,090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations increase to 79,733, and the total number of fatalities climb by 19,125 over 90 days in NYC. All in all, we conclude that even very short, temporary increases in contact rates can have disproportionate effects and result in unrecoverable phenomena that can hardly be reversed or managed later. The numbers show possible phenomena before they might develop effects in reality. This is important because phenomena such as the described blip can impact the hospitals in reality. Therefore, we warn that a wave of infections due to increased contact rates during Passover/Easter might come as a result!","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vierlboeck, Maximilian; Nilchiani, Roshanak R; Edwards, Christine M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec03292e5b03b42261c400a361840d7f22c6abf3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NYC"],"locations":["NYC","Germany"],"keyphrases":["effects of contact rate","contact rate spikes","increased contact rates","temporary sustained increase of contact rate","devastating infection rate","temporary increases","total fatalities","increase of infection","total number of fatalities","total cases","total number of cases","following increases","disproportionate effects","Easter holidays","possible phenomena","possible extreme effects","maximum number of required hospitalizations","Passover","Easter weekend","example","hospitals","unrecoverable phenomena","reported numbers","maximum of required hospitalizations","time intervals","surge","long run","NYC","reality","singular events of increased visits","multiple simulations scenarios","realistic reference run","scenario close","bioterrorism research","close proximity","general observation","general finding","Section V","New York City","spread","aftermath results","problems","infrastructures","contacts","Germany","described blip","space","wave of infections","pandemics","various issues","medical equipment","beds","affected people","row","baseline","influences","Executive Summary","present COVID","institutions","data","measures","place","paper","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

These infections occur mainly in the first month after transplantation and are hospital-acquired. Nosocomial infections cause significant morbidity and are the most common cause of mortality in this early period of transplantation. These infections are caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms, mainly Gram-negative enterobacteria, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococci. The patients at risk of developing nosocomial bacterial infections are those previously colonized with MDR bacteria while on the transplant waiting list. Intravascular catheters, the urinary tract, the lungs, and surgical wounds are the most frequent sources of infection. Preventive measures are the same as those applied in non-immunocompromised, hospitalized patients except in patients at high risk for developing fungal infection. These patients need antifungal therapy during their hospitalization, and for preventing some bacterial infections in the early transplant period, patients need vaccinations on the waiting list according to the current recommendations. Although morbidity and mortality related to infectious diseases have decreased during the last few years in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, they are still one of the most important complications in this population. Furthermore, as occurs in the general population, the incidence of nosocomial infections has increased during the different phases of transplantation. It is difficult to establish general preventive measures in these patients, as there are many risk factors conditioning these infections. Firstly, they undergo multiple antibiotic treatments and interventions; secondly, there is a wide variability in the degree of neutropenia and immunosuppression among patients, and finally they combine hospital and home stay during the transplant process. However, some simple measures could be implemented to improve the current situation.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno Camacho, Asunci\u00F3n; Ruiz Camps, Isabel","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c56f09cb8f07a0c72bd39d180ce217bd6118ca20.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X1400189X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X1400189X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the lungs","the incidence of nosocomial infections","the most frequent","in these patients","the urinary tract","of mortality in","the current recommendations","as occurs in the general population","The patients at risk of developing nosocomial bacterial infections","the most common infections in solid organ transplant recipients","increased during the different","still one of the most important complications in","and for preventing some bacterial infections in the early transplant period","the same as those applied in non","These infections occur mainly in the first month after transplantation and","of infection","infecciones nosocomiales","Abstract Bacterial infections","patients need vaccinations on the waiting list according","caso de pacientes","pacientes hospitalizados","early period of transplantation","and staphylococci","infecci\u00F3n nosocomial","have decreased during the last few years in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","many risk factors conditioning these infections","hospitalized patients except in patients at high risk for developing fungal infection","those previously colonized with MDR bacteria while on the transplant waiting list","These patients need antifungal therapy during","significant morbidity and","and surgical wounds","Although morbidity and mortality related","trasplante de \u00F3rgano s\u00F3lido","trasplante de progenitores hematopoy\u00E9ticos","as there","mainly Gram","establish general preventive","poblaci\u00F3n general","prevenci\u00F3n de infecci\u00F3n","infecci\u00F3n f\u00FAngica","periodo precoz","lista de espera","paciente a paciente","bacterias multirresistentes","medidas preventivas generales","TPH","negative enterobacteria","negative bacilli","fermentative Gram","microorganismos multirresistentes","infectious","hospitalization","they","immunocompromised","drug resistant","microorganisms","caused by multi","enterobacterias gramnegativas","enterococci","bacilos gramnegativos","mayor\u00EDa adquiridas","intervenciones","m\u00FAltiples tratamientos antibi\u00F3ticos","riesgo elevado","difficult","Furthermore","gran morbilidad","Intravascular catheters","enterococos","causa","neutropenia","inmunodepresi\u00F3n","domiciliaria","proceso","recomendaciones","acquired","incidencia","cat\u00E9teres intravasculares","pulm\u00F3n","tiempo de hospitalizaci\u00F3n","estancia hospitalaria","\u00E1mbito hospitalario","estafilococos","duda","factores","herida quir\u00FArgica","morbimortalidad asociada","situaci\u00F3n actual","fases","menudo","focos","complicaciones","parte","embargo","and finally they","hospital and home stay during the transplant process","they undergo multiple antibiotic treatments and interventions","wide variability in the degree of neutropenia and immunosuppression among patients","improve the current situation","could be implemented","secondly","there","some simple","Firstly","However"],"language":"es"},

While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. Results: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values\u003C0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values\u003E0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. Discussions and Conclusions: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, D.; Shi, L.; Zhao, J.; Liu, P.; Schwartz, J.; Gao, S.; Sarnat, J.

Nevertheless, data about optimal prewarming-time from published clinical trials report contradictory results. We conducted this pilot study to evaluate routine clinical practice regarding prewarming and its effect on the prevalence of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing transurethral resection (TUR) under spinal anesthesia. This was a prospective, observational, pilot study to examine clinical practice in a tertiary hospital regarding prewarming in 140 consecutive patients. When prewarming (pw) was performed, forced-air warming was provided in the pre-anesthesia room for 15 (pw15), 30 (pw30), or 45 (pw45) min. Tympanic temperature was recorded upon entering the pre-anesthesia room, at the time of initiating surgery, and every 15 min intra-operatively. We also recorded duration of the surgical procedure and length of stay in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Pw15 was performed in 34 patients, pw30 in 29 patients, and pw45 in 21 patients. Fifty-six patients did not receive pw and 96% of them developed hypothermia at the end of the surgical procedure, compared to 73% of patients in pw15 (p = 0.002), 75% in pw30 (p = 0.006) and 90% in pw45 (p = 0.3). Length of stay in the PACU was markedly shorter in pw15 (131 \u00B1 69 min) and pw30 (123 \u00B1 60 min) than in the non-pw group (197 \u00B1 105 min) (p = 0.015 and p = 0.011, respectively). This difference was not significant in pw45 (129 \u00B1 56 min) compared to non-pw patients. In conclusion, prewarming for 15 or 30 min before TUR under spinal anesthesia prevents development of hypothermia at the end of the surgical procedure.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becerra, \u00C1ngel; Valencia, Luc\u00EDa; Ferrando, Carlos; Villar, Jes\u00FAs; Rodr\u00EDguez-P\u00E9rez, Aurelio","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52960-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TUR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-pw patients","consecutive patients","pw45","pw15","pw30","spinal anesthesia","pre-anesthesia room","optimal prewarming-time","surgical procedure","development of hypothermia","non-pw group","routine clinical practice","clinical trials","pilot study","prevalence of perioperative hypothermia","Post-Anesthesia Care Unit","PACU","end","intraoperative inadvertent hypothermia","length","time of initiating surgery","transurethral resection","effect","tertiary hospital","contradictory results","data","duration","air warming","Tympanic temperature","difference","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sedaghat, Ahmad R; Gengler, Isabelle; Speth, Marlene M","journal":"Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820926464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitivity of COVID","important symptom of COVID","OD cases","cases of OD","greater understanding of COVID","large proportion of COVID","patients","subjective OD","sudden-onset OD","sudden-onset anosmia","PRACTICE Sudden anosmia","OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease","objective olfactory testing","Olfactory dysfunction","DATA SOURCES PubMed","chosen data sources","earliest stages of disease","scientific evidence","major drivers of disease spread","taste dysfunction","CONCLUSIONS Current evidence","REVIEW METHODS Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent","Google Scholar","public health tool","cough","observation","shortness of breath","objectives","gained traction","millions of individuals","conservative management","screening strategies","hyposmia","advanced imaging","short term","Web of Science","global pandemic","higher prevalence","characteristic symptoms of fever","study","asymptomatic carriers","period","IMPLICATIONS","myriad clinical manifestations","hundreds of thousands","weeks"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a comprehensive analysis of ammonia emission estimations is accomplished at both temporal (1980-2016) and spatial (provincial) scales using a mass-balanced model, and emission projections through 2030 are also studied in different development scenarios. The results show that the ammonia emissions increased from 4.7 Tg N yr-1 in 1980 to 11 Tg N yr-1 in 2016, which is an approximately 2.4-fold increase. The cropland and livestock emissions are the largest contributors, as most reports show approximately 80% contributions; however, nonagriculture sources of fuel combustion, waste treatment and ammonia escape have grown rapidly in recent years, accounting for 14% in 2016. The spatial differences also reveal the complex heterogeneity in Chinese provinces. In addition, the emission intensities of major agriculture and non-agriculture sources are 0-80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and over 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, indicating a higher degree of ammonia concentration from non-agriculture emissions, which should attract wide concern. In terms of scenario analysis, emissions would reach 12.8 Tg N yr-1 in 2030 under the currently developed model and 7.3 Tg N yr-1 under a series of reduction policies; the spatial analysis also shows that the North China Plain has a 2.1 Tg N yr-1 reduction potential. The results of this study provide new insights into ammonia emission estimations and a better understanding of the environmental impacts of ammonia emitted from different sources.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Hang; Luo, Zhibo; Hu, Shanying","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tg N"],"locations":["North China Plain"],"keyphrases":["Tg N yr","ammonia emissions","N ha","ammonia escape","comprehensive analysis of ammonia emission estimations","environmental impacts of ammonia","non-agriculture emissions","high-level ammonia loss","spatial analysis","non-agriculture sources","higher degree of ammonia concentration","livestock emissions","emission projections","different sources","emission intensities of major agriculture","study","spatial differences","results","terms of scenario analysis","nonagriculture sources of fuel combustion","developed model","reduction potential","Chinese provinces","mass-balanced model","series of reduction policies","Chinese haze formation","different development scenarios","waste treatment","better understanding","new insights","complex heterogeneity","scales","largest contributors","key factor","Excessive anthropogenic activities","North China","recent years","reports","contributions","cropland","addition","volatilization","wide concern","accounting","temporal","fold increase"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV primarily infects the small intestine instead of the large intestine in vivo However, the underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism to different intestinal segments remains poorly understood as a result of the lack of a suitable in vitro intestinal model that recapitulates the cellular diversity and complex functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we established the PDCoV infection model of crypt-derived enteroids from different intestinal segments. Enteroids were susceptible to PDCoV and multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia were infected by PDCoV in vitro and in vivo We further found that PDCoV favorably infected the jejunum and ileum, and restrictedly replicated in the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, enteroids from different intestinal regions displayed a distinct gene expression profile, and the differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N (APN) instead of the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different intestinal segments to PDCoV although PDCoV substantially elicited antiviral genes production in enteroids after infection. Additional studies showed that PDCoV infection significantly induced the expression of type I and III IFNs at the late stage of infection, and exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication in enteroids. Hence, our results provide critical inputs to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The zoonotic potential of the PDCoV, a coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from broad species including porcine, chicken and human, emphasizes the urgent need to further study the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV in its natural host. Herein, we generated crypt stem cell-derived enteroids from porcine different intestinal regions, which well recapitulated the events in vivo of PDCoV infection that PDCoV targeted multiple types of intestinal epithelia and preferably infected the jejunum and ileum compared with the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the expression of APN receptor rather than the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different regions of the intestines to PDCoV infection though PDCoV infection markedly elicited the IFN responses. Our findings provide important insights into how the distinct gene expression profiles of the intestinal segments determine the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Lingdan; Chen, Jianfei; Li, Liang; Guo, Shanshan; Xue, Mei; Zhang, Jialin; Liu, Xiang; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00480-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","PDCoV","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tissue tropism of PDCoV","PDCoV infection model of crypt","molecular mechanisms of PDCoV","underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism","porcine different intestinal regions","susceptibility of different intestinal segments","intestinal model","exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication","susceptibility of different regions","multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia","multiple types of intestinal epithelia","IFN responses","expression of APN receptor","late stage of infection","expression of type","crypt stem cell-derived enteroids","distinct gene expression profiles","host interactions","natural host","Porcine deltacoronavirus","jejunum","ileum","duodenum","colon","differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N","important insights","large intestine","small intestine","important enteropathogen of swine","broad species","intestines","pathogenesis","IMPORTANCE","infecting cells","cellular diversity","antiviral genes production","complex functions","human","chicken","zoonotic potential","IFNs","worldwide distribution","lack","events","critical inputs","gastrointestinal tract","urgent need","Additional studies","results","findings"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES To identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with the severe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS All adult patients (\u226518 years old) consecutively admitted in Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS A total of 108 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-five patients (23.1%, 25/108) developed severe disease, and of those 12 (48%, 12/25) patients died. Advanced age, co-morbidities with hypertension, higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher sensitive C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation \u2161 (APECHE \u2161) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with higher SOFA score (OR 2.450, 1.302-4.608; p = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8\u00D7109 per L (OR 9.017, 2.808-28.857; p \u003C0.001) on admission. The higher SOFA score (OR 2.402, 1.313-4.395; p = 0.004) on admission was identified as risk factor for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytopenia and the higher SOFA score on admission could help clinicians to identify patients with high risk for developing severe COVID-19. More related studies are needed in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Qingchun; Wang, Peng; Wang, Xingguang; Qie, Guoqiang; Meng, Mei; Tong, Xiwen; Bai, Xue; Ding, Min; Liu, Weiming; Liu, Keke; Chu, Yufeng","journal":"Polish archives of internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dabieshan Medical Center","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","SOFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher SOFA score","severe disease","adult patients","increasing odds of severe COVID","severe incidence of SARS","admission","higher blood leukocyte count","neutrophil count","risk factors","high risk","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lower lymphocyte count","higher sensitive C-reactive protein level","albumin level","greater risk of development","SARS-CoV","infection","D-dimer level","INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease","Acute Physiology","hypertension","co-morbidities","Chronic Health Evaluation","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","APECHE","clinicians","years old","Multivariable regression","Advanced age","clinical characteristics","CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytopenia","retrospective cohort study","Dabieshan Medical Center","interim guidance","hospital death","METHODS","related studies","future","OBJECTIVES","total"],"language":"en"},

To this end, we designed and deployed a questionnaire via Influweb, a Web platform for participatory surveillance in Italy, during the 2017 - 18 and 2018 - 19 seasons. We collected 599 surveys completed by 434 users. The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes voluntarily implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26%), ii) only moderately (36%), iii) significant (38%) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, 66% of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals\u0027 characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task and are associated to significant changes in behaviors. Overall, the research contributes to the small set of empirical studies devoted to the data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gozzi, Nicol\u00F2; Perrotta, Daniela; Paolotti, Daniela; Perra, Nicola","journal":"PLoS computational biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influweb"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant changes","type of behavioral changes","significant features","self-initiated behavioral changes","behaviors","set of features","data-driven characterization of behavioral changes","classification task","recency of past illnesses","perceived susceptibility","perceived severity","past experience","seasonal flu","small set of empirical studies","target categories","Web platform","individuals\u0027 characteristics","level of concerns","complex relationships","attitude","main factors","socio-demographic information","participatory surveillance","extent","machine learning algorithms","Influweb","Italy","infection","category","infectious diseases","settings","questionnaire","intensity","Gradient Boosted Trees","importance","research","samples","response","participant","surveys","users","variables","work","end","seasons"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring.

METHODS Retrospective review of all coronal and metopic craniosynostosis patients undergoing CVR and FOA from March 2010 to June 2019 was performed. Before 2014 (\u0022Control group\u0022), all patients received blood transfusion at the start of surgery. In 2014, a protocol of preoperative EPO and ferrous sulfate with perioperative TXA and non-automatic transfusion was instituted (\u0022Study group\u0022). Patient demographics and anthropometrics, perioperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and transfusion details were collected and compared. RESULTS Thirty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one patients were in the control group, and 15 in the Study group. Nineteen patients had metopic synostosis, 11 had unicoronal synostosis, and 6 had bicoronal synostosis. There were no significant differences between groups in demographics, operative time, intraoperative crystalloid volume, craniofacial syndromes, or sutures affected. The Study group had higher preoperative Hb (13.9 \u00B1 1.0 vs. 12.6 \u00B1 0.8 g/dL, p \u003C 0.001), lower intraoperative Hb nadir (7.4 \u00B1 1.8 vs. 9.2 \u00B1 1.2 g/dL) lower intraoperative transfusion rate (66.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.008), lower postoperative transfusion rate (0% vs 28.6%, p = 0.03), and exposure to fewer unique units of packed red blood cells (0.7 \u00B1 0.6 vs. 1.5 \u00B1 0.9 units).

The improved technical quality and dependability of video-mediated consultations has opened up the possibility for more widespread use. However, questions remain regarding clinical quality and safety. Video-mediated consultations are sometimes criticized for being not as good as face-to-face, but there has been little previous in-depth research on their interactional dynamics, and no agreement on what a good video consultation looks like. OBJECTIVE Using conversation analysis, this study aimed to identify and analyze the communication strategies through which video-mediated consultations are accomplished and to produce recommendations for patients and clinicians to improve the communicative quality of such consultations. METHODS We conducted an in-depth analysis of the clinician-patient interaction in a sample of video-mediated consultations and a comparison sample of face-to-face consultations drawn from 4 clinical settings across 2 trusts (1 community and 1 acute care) in the UK National Health Service. The video dataset consisted of 37 recordings of video-mediated consultations (with diabetes, antenatal diabetes, cancer, and heart failure patients), 28 matched audio recordings of face-to-face consultations, and fieldnotes from before and after each consultation. We also conducted 37 interviews with staff and 26 interviews with patients. Using linguistic ethnography (combining analysis of communication with an appreciation of the context in which it takes place), we examined in detail how video interaction was mediated by 2 software platforms (Skype and FaceTime). RESULTS Patients had been selected by their clinician as appropriate for video-mediated consultation. Most consultations in our sample were technically and clinically unproblematic. However, we identified 3 interactional challenges: (1) opening the video consultation, (2) dealing with disruption to conversational flow (eg, technical issues with audio and/or video), and (3) conducting an examination. Operational and technological issues were the exception rather than the norm. In all but 1 case, both clinicians and patients (deliberately or intuitively) used established communication strategies to successfully negotiate these challenges. Remote physical examinations required the patient (and, in some cases, a relative) to simultaneously follow instructions and manipulate technology (eg, camera) to make it possible for the clinician to see and hear adequately. CONCLUSIONS A remote video link alters how patients and clinicians interact and may adversely affect the flow of conversation. However, our data suggest that when such problems occur, clinicians and patients can work collaboratively to find ways to overcome them. There is potential for a limited physical examination to be undertaken remotely with some patients and in some conditions, but this appears to need complex interactional work by the patient and/or their relatives. We offer preliminary guidance for patients and clinicians on what is and is not feasible when consulting via a video link.

As a matter of fact, a new SARS-type virus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. The results obtained evidence two stable binding modes with guanine quadruplexes, driven either by electrostatic (dimeric mode) or by dispersion (monomeric mode) interactions, are proposed being the dimeric mode the preferred one, according to the analysis of the corresponding free energy surfaces. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.

Our model can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for COVID-19 when allocating limited testing resources.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zoabi, Y.; Shomron, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c49b814c63258f8bab2be7ff4462cb6fe2601139.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20093948v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening suspected COVID","efficient diagnosis of COVID","simple features","limited healthcare resources","limited testing resources","tested individuals","cases","triaging patients","test set","test results","nationwide data","healthcare systems","Effective screening of SARS","infected individual","following week","records","high accuracy","information","close contact","medical staff","general population","initial clinical symptoms","machine learning approach","hopes","age","gender","risk of infection","basic questions","burden","Prediction models","considerations"],"language":"en"},

Post-Soviet states are facing unique challenges due to their developing healthcare systems and unstable economy. The aim of this paper was to provide estimates for current development COVID-19 pandemic in the Post-Soviet states and forecast potential best and worst scenarios for spread of this deadly infection. Methods: The data on confirmed cases and deaths were extracted from official governmental sources for a period from beginning of outbreak dates for each country until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the parameters of epidemic in 10 post-Soviet states and forecast the number of cases over a period of 10, 30 and 60 days. We also estimated the numbers of cases based on the optimal measures (best scenario) and suboptimal measures (worst scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in these countries. Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan are expected to reach their peaks in the coming week (April 29 - May 7, 2020), with comparatively low cases of COVID-19 and loss of lives in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the worst scenario during the next 30 and 60 days. Geographical remoteness and small number of international travelers from the countries heavily affected by the pandemic could also have contributed to delay in the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Issanov, A.; Amanbek, Y.; Abbay, A.; Adambekov, S.; Aljofan, M.; Kashkynbayev, A.; Gaipov, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbacd95e169c4c1412ead0d471dd9ee58ac127b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071704v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Armenia","Kazakhstan","Kyrgyzstan","Moldova","Uzbekistan","Belarus","Russia"],"keyphrases":["studied Post-Soviet States","low cases of COVID","development of COVID","number of cases","current development COVID","potential spread of COVID","largest number of COVID","confirmed cases","active cases","numbers of cases","worst scenarios","pandemic","countries","days","best scenario","estimated possible scenarios","potential best","peaks","period","best-case scenario","parameters of epidemic","future epidemic","developing healthcare systems","current protection rates","suboptimal measures","unique challenges","healthcare professionals","small number of international travelers","extreme challenges","Governmental response","official governmental sources","deaths","Kazakhstan","Geographical remoteness","important determining factor responsible","loss of lives","Kyrgyzstan","Moldova","Uzbekistan","unstable economy","data","proposed model","outbreaks","estimates","Belarus","Russia","Ukraine","Armenia","outbreak dates","Azerbaijan","paper","Methods","delay","modified SEIR","deadly infection","contrast","country","modelling","Conclusion","coming week","plans","world","Background","Results","aim"],"language":"en"},

Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (\u003E 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination.

The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khobahi, Shahin; Agarwal, Chirag; Soltanalian, Mojtaba","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/316775167b82a2349011fd90932d3c9237723804.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","classification of COVID","non-COVID pneumonia","chest X-ray manifestation of COVID","non-COVID classes","available X-ray dataset","key diagnosis","X-ray images specific","chest X-ray imaging","proposed framework","diagnosis purposes","RT-PCR test","healthy cases","new Coronavirus disease","classification methodology","semi-supervised learning methodology","limited available dataset","task of automatic diagnosis","Corona virus disease","semi-supervised nature","semi-supervised approach","based method","sophisticated deep learning-based signal","sophisticated methodologies","efficient training","suspected cases","expensive test","chest Computed Tomography","current global standard","indispensable tool","screening tool","existing methodologies","standard reference","deep architecture","efficient classifier","early works","global pandemic","relevant features specific","limited data regime","times fewer training parameters","real-time polymerase chain reaction","image processing technique","cost-effective X-ray","AutoEncoders","infected legions","sensitivity","identification","novel","research","state-of-the-art methods","analysis","great candidates","initial representations","expert-annotated lesion area","billions","China","radiologist","attribution maps","triage state","explainable artificial intelligence tools","large number of lives","intermediate stages","negatives","high rates of false","use","Wuhan city","Hubei","healthcare community","numerical investigations","diseases","codes","paper","world","end"],"language":"en"},

The measures often include physical distancing that aims to reduce the number of contacts in the population. Little is known about the actual reduction in number of contacts as a consequence of physical distancing measures. Methods In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016/2017 in which 8179 participants retrospectively reported the number, age and gender of different persons they had contacted (spoken to in person or touched) during the previous day. The survey was repeated among 2830 of the original participants, using the same questionnaire, in March and April 2020 after physical distancing measures had been implemented. Results The average number of contacts in the community was reduced from on average 12.5 (interquartile range: 2-17) to 3.7 (interquartile range: 0-4) different persons per participant, a reduction of 71% (95% confidence interval: 71-71). The reduction in the number of community contacts was highest for children and adolescents (between 5 and 20 years) and smallest for elderly persons of 80 years and older. The reduction in the effective number of total contacts, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with community and household contacts, was 62% (95% confidence interval: 48 - 72).

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davidson, Andrew D.; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Lewis, Sebastian; Shoemark, Deborah; Carroll, Miles W.; Heesom, Kate; Zambon, Maria; Ellis, Joanna; Lewis, Phillip A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Matthews, David A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ad39be296a7e5c6c7f03a5f41348fc3339fdaf1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002204","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Oxford Nanopore MinION"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S glycoprotein","viral transcriptome","viral peptides","viral pathogenicity","proposed furin cleavage site","transcriptome of SARS","SARS-CoV","pattern of viral transcripts","viral genome sequence","growth of viral stocks","subgenomic mRNAs","transcriptome analysis","regions of SARS","predicted replication","proteins","viable deletion","virus entry","frame deletion","peptides unique","mapped transcripts","novel coronavirus","zoonotic coronavirus transmission","Oxford Nanopore MinION","functional subunits","research","observation","potential vaccine target","animal challenge models","deleted variant","barrier","Direct RNA sequencing","different levels of virulence","morbidity","exit","transcription model","coronaviruses","tandem mass spectrometry","spike","developed ORF-centric pipeline","mortality","half","pathogenesis","point","motif","Vero E6 cells","variations","zoonosis","Detection","phosphopeptides","clinical samples","clear significance","cell line","feature"],"language":"en"},

Despite profound health consequences, the impacts of diarrhea-causing microbes on the evolutionary history of host species are largely unknown. We investigated patterns of genetic variation in mammalian Guanylate Cyclase-C (GC-C), an intestinal receptor frequently targeted by bacterial enterotoxins, to determine how hosts might adapt in response to diarrheal infections. Under normal conditions, GC-C interacts with endogenous guanylin peptides to promote water secretion in the intestine, but signaling can be hijacked by bacterially-encoded heat-stable enterotoxins (STa) during infection, which leads to overstimulation of GC-C and diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed evidence of recurrent positive selection in the GC-C ligand-binding domain in primates and bats, consistent with selective pressures to evade interactions with STa. Using in vitro assays and transgenic intestinal organoids to model STa-mediated diarrhea, we show that GC-C diversification in these lineages results in substantial variation in toxin susceptibility. In bats, we observe a unique pattern of compensatory coevolution in the endogenous GC-C ligand uroguanylin, reflecting intense bouts of positive selection at the receptor-ligand interface. These findings demonstrate control of water physiology as a previously unrecognized interface for genetic conflict and reveal diarrheal pathogens as a source of selective pressure among diverse mammals.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carey, Clayton M.; Apple, Sarah E.; Hilbert, Zo\u0451 A.; Kay, Michael S.; Elde, Nels C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c74ce89f3625a7fafdeb8ea1e1255c836da405db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.014761","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GC-C diversification","endogenous GC-C ligand uroguanylin","GC-C ligand-binding domain","overstimulation of GC","mammalian Guanylate Cyclase-C","intestinal receptor","intestinal water absorption","receptor-ligand interface","water secretion","model STa-mediated diarrhea","diarrheal pathogens","impacts of diarrhea","bats","diarrheal infections","transgenic intestinal organoids","patterns of genetic variation","control of water physiology","intense bouts of positive selection","evidence of recurrent positive selection","substantial variation","selective pressures","genetic conflict","diverse mammals","unrecognized interface","bacterial enterotoxins","pathogenesis of infectious diarrheal diseases","endogenous guanylin peptides","source of selective pressure","encoded heat-stable enterotoxins","lineages results","primates","enterotoxin proteins","microbes","unique pattern of compensatory coevolution","evolutionary history of host species","toxin susceptibility","assays","hosts","interactions","severe dehydration","profound health consequences","Phylogenetic analysis","response","findings","normal conditions","intestine"],"language":"en"},

Until a vaccine or therapy is found, the most effective method of prophylaxis has been to minimize transmission via rigorous social distancing and seclusion of all but essential workers. Such measures, implemented at different times and to varying degrees worldwide, have reduced the rate of transmission compared with early phases of the pandemic, resulting in flattening of the curve followed by a gradual reduction in mortality after \u003E6 weeks of rigorous social distancing measures. The cost of rigorous social distancing has been seen in radically reduced economic activity, job losses, disruption of schooling and social institutions. A key question facing policy makers and individuals is when to resume normal economic and social activity in the face of persistent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 . To help address this question, we have developed a model that accurately describes the entire transmission and mortality curves in Italy and Spain, two hard-hit countries that have maintained severe social distancing measures for over 2 months. Our model quantitatively describes the rapid rise and slow decay of new cases and deaths observed under stringent social distancing (the long tail effect). We predict that even when social distancing is rigorously maintained, the number of COVID-19 deaths after peak mortality may be 2-3 times larger than the total number of deaths up to the peak. Our model has important policy implications for countries currently debating how to ease social distancing measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osherovich, V.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Po; Qi, Jun; Zhang, Shuhao; Bi, Gaoshan; Wang, Xulong; Yang, Yun; Sheng, Bin; Mao, Xuxin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b478ceff05d4c8dcc2481121eaace20a1b674cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["China","London"],"keyphrases":["UK","cases of COVID","suppression intervention","total infections","distribution of infections","multiple interventions","multiple rolling interventions","peak healthcare demand","growth of deaths","peak time of healthcare demand","separation of infections","multiple pharmaceutical interventions","practical healthcare demand","lengths of COVID","reduction of healthcare demand","critical cases","non-London regions","high band of rolling intervention intensity","non-pharmaceutical interventions","intensity range","immediate intensive intervention","calibrated model","reproduction number R","average-number contacts","equivalent hospital beds","countries","Recent outbreak","epicentre of outbreak","data","weeks","outbreaks","infectious individuals","immediate lockdowns","susceptible individuals","equivalent effect","impact of mitigation","increased health need","population","novel coronavirus disease","direct link","effectiveness","cities","breakouts","peaks","accounting","rapid global spread","important features","social anxiety","apparent pros","cons","China","multi-modal mode","Wuhan","Hubei","world","year","Background","days","epidemic","scenario","optimal strategy","feasibility study","isolation","Methods","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The Italian government adopted urgent measures to hold its spread. Enforcing compliance to such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens\u0027 in the COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens compliance to health emergency containment measures. Method: An online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out. Results: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. Conclusions: The Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graffigna, G.; Barello, S.; Savarese, M.; Palamenghi, L.; Castellini, G.; Bonanomi, A.; Lozza, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075234v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Engagement"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measure of Health Engagement","role of health engagement","health management","health threats","Low levels of Health Engagement","levels of engagement","Patient Health Engagement Model","health emergency containment measures","urgent measures","higher levels of perceived susceptibility","severity","COVID","coronavirus disease","Italy","change","spread","predicting citizens compliance","terms of perceived susceptibility","engaged people","PHE-S","series of ANOVAs","preventive process","previous studies","preventive behaviors","intervention studies","healthcare authorities","healthcare professionals","effectiveness of educational initiatives","variables","Logistic regressions","particular groups","Conclusions","orientation","behavioral responses","useful framework","stress","crosstabs","usual purchase behavior","knowledge","Results","Italian government","order","habits","normal conditions","relationship","questionnaire","Engaging citizens\u0027","Method","online survey","representative sample","Italians","best","items","world","pandemics","purchases","Background"],"language":"en"},

Mask wearing and hand washing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely hand washing is often impossible. METHODS The efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time RT-PCR. Previous studies on mask wearing were reviewed. RESULTS Instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical mask wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data we propose the approach of mask wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS A simple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences.

It has thought to be originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This outbreak has link to Wuhan\u0027s seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets [3,4]. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, it has now spread to each and every corner of the world [1,2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) situation report (77th), updated on 6 April, 2020 there have been globally 1210956 confirmed cases and 67 594 deaths of COVID-19 [2]. This viral outbreak has now posed a global threat to healthcare systems. So many, efforts are going on to find new drugs or to repurpose already existed drugs [1,5-7]. Majoritily, it has been found that most of the COVID-19 patients belong to cardiovascular comorbidities [8-10]. It is obvious that they qualify for antihypertensive therapy. Many of them are treating with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)[8]. There has been considerable debate in scientific community and health professionals about whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase attractiveness towards the COVID-19 virus infection or not ?[9-16]. One of the important concern highlighted by these studies involving antihypertensive medications suggested that these drugs might cause increments in abundance of SARS-CoV-2 receptor henceforth causing COVID-19 by entering into cells [17,18]. This suggests plausible increase in ACE2 receptors on lung and heart cells and hence offering more entry points for SARS-CoV-2[17]. However, no strong evidence has been noted. There has been more number of commentaries published explaining both sides and still they are appearing on daily basis [12-16]. Herein, we tried to summaries, clinical aspects on ACEs and ARBs based on literature and commentaries to explain both the sides. A recent published article in Nature by Zhou et al. (2020)[19], reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is acting as receptor for SARS Coronavirus 2.This receptors was also acted as receptors for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. Zhou et al. (2020), clearly wrote that \u0022We show that 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) is able to use ACE2 proteins as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating that ACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells\u0022. ACE2 is aminopeptidase responsible for cleaving angiotensin I and angiotensin II into the angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-(1-7) peptides[20]. Normally, ACE2 have been found to be overexpressed in clinical conditions including heart failure, arterial hypertension, etc. It has also been noted that ACE2 acts as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. There have been several literatures supporting the role of a cardiovascular-protective ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. Recent viewpoint article published in JAMA journal by author Majd AlGhatrif exaplains[15] correlations among aging, cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19 patients. He clearly concluded important fact saying, \u0022compared with young individuals, older persons with cardiovascular disorders (CVD); who already have reduced ACE2 levels will be expected to be more predisposed to exaggerated inflammation with further reduction in ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19, manifesting with greater disease severity\u0022. One of well-known Austrian scientist Prof. Josef Penninger[21], Josef Penninger noted important relationship between RAS (the renin-angiotensin system) and ACE2. He is particularly focusing on ACE2 as a potential treatment approach. In one of the article by Mourad et al., (2020), explained different effects on ACE2 levels in correlation with different administrations of RAAS inhibitors and believed that chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors has no reason to influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection[22]. A reply to this article has also been published by Zheng et al., (2020)[23] saying that \u0022although ACE2 has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the role of ACE2 in the progression of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection is still controversial, so the benefits of aliskiren use in patients with COVID-19 needs further investigation\u0022. Today, many healthcare societies\u0027 especially cardiovascular societies are urging the patients suffering from CVDs (cardiovascular diseases) not to discontinue their medications[24-26]. These healthcare societies give more stress upon statement saying that there is no sound evidence to correlate ACEs and ARBs leading risk of COVID-19 infection. It has also been noted that healthcare societies do not suggest immediate starting of ACEIs/ARBs in those patients having no settlements with clinical conditions like heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, etc. As these statements adheres to current state of evidences. The same conclusion has been derived from the recent article by Ankit Patel et al., (2020)[24]. This article suggested that there has been no definitive evidence to suggest ACE inhibitors and ARBs worsening of COVID-19. A study published by Vaduganathan et al., (2020) in New England Journal of Medicine discussed the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels[27]. They also derived to conclusion that ACE2 may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients with lung injury. This team also suggests that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful. A very recent review published by Dr. Sanchis-Gomar and his co-authors in Mayo Clinic Proceedings[14], by analysing more than 60 articles, concluded the fact that \u0022no studies have reported an increase in circulating ACE2 levels or expression thus far, and increased expression would not necessarily imply an increased risk of infection or disease severity\u0022. Dr. Sanchis-Gomar, studies both articles explaining that elevated levels of angiotensin II fostering acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as significance of RAAS inhibitors in therapy in treating patients with COVID-19. However, authors noted that more research in this regard is needed. CONCLUSION In this regards, more laboratory and clinical evidences are required in order to decide COVID-19 treatment. In conclusion to this debate, suggesting roles of antihypertensive agents and severity leading changes in ACE2 levels, may shed more light on infectivity and outcome of COVID-19.There is an urgent need to establish whether treatments with antihypertensive (ACEI\u0027s/ ARBs) needs to be determined.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mali, Suraj N; Thorat, Bapu R; Chopade, Atul R","journal":"Infectious disorders drug targets","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526520666200511005546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zhou","Majd AlGhatrif","Josef Penninger","Zheng","Sanchis-Gomar"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS Coronavirus","RAS","RAAS","New England Journal of Medicine"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ACE2 receptors","cardiovascular-protective ACE2-angiotensin","ACE2 expression","ACE2 proteins","ACE2 acts","express ACE2","ACE2 levels","angiotensin receptor blockers","cleaving angiotensin","entry receptor","SARS-CoV","functional receptor","cell receptor","context of COVID","deaths of COVID","renin-angiotensin system","SARS Coronavirus","abundance of SARS","heart cells","Mas receptor axis","cardiovascular disorders","cardiovascular diseases","cardiovascular comorbidities","recent published article","Josef Penninger","ARBs","enzyme inhibitor","viral outbreak","World Health Organization","entry points","important relationship","patients","important concern","important fact","new drugs","Zhou","nCoV","sides","Recent viewpoint article","current life threatening pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease","health professionals","heart failure","clinical conditions","clinical aspects","antihypertensive medications","antihypertensive therapy","plausible increase","number of commentaries","greater disease severity","JAMA journal","Wuhan\u0027s seafood","RAS","inhibitors","author Majd AlGhatrif exaplains","older persons","correlations","lung","ACEI","exotic animal wholesale markets","scientific community","link","young individuals","ACEs","reduction","aging","considerable debate","global threat","arterial hypertension","aminopeptidase responsible","EDITOR","CVD","well-known Austrian scientist","studies","inflammation","attractiveness","Nature","role","increments","terms of mortality","situation report","HCoV-NL63","healthcare systems","summaries","confirmed cases","potential treatment approach","economic losses","virus infection","literatures","China","strong evidence","daily basis","efforts","corner","Majoritily","peptides","progression of COVID","outcome of COVID","circulating ACE2 levels","ARBs leading risk of COVID","role of ACE2","conclusion","ACE inhibitors","withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors","significance of RAAS inhibitors","different administrations of RAAS inhibitors","recent article","increased risk of infection","cardiovascular societies","elevated levels of angiotensin","uncertain effects of RAAS blockers","different effects","clinical evidences","increased expression","Sanchis-Gomar","articles","course of SARS","healthcare societies\u0027","severity leading changes","disease severity","chronic treatment","sound evidence","definitive evidence","recent review","roles of antihypertensive agents","current state of evidences","correlation","settlements","acute respiratory distress syndrome","diabetes","co-authors","treatments","reason","light","therapy","New England Journal of Medicine","immediate starting of ACEIs","benefits of aliskiren use","hypertension","statements","debate","regards","laboratory","order","Mayo Clinic Proceedings","infectivity","Ankit Patel","ACEI\u0027s","CVDs","lung injury","urgent need","research","team","fact","study","Vaduganathan","medications","Mourad","reply","Zheng","investigation"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%. Our results show the coming challenge for the health care system in Canada and the potential role of self-isolation in reducing demand for hospital-based and ICU care.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoukat, Affan; Wells, Chad R; Langley, Joanne M; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["ICU care","potential role of self-isolation","ICU bed capacity","ICU bed days","ICU bed requirement","peak of COVID","peak of outbreaks","reduced ICU use","total number of ICU beds","current ICU bed occupancy rates","bed requirements","critical care","peak of infection","estimates of COVID","health care system","intensive care unit","Canada","substantial demand","ill people","hospital admission","average number","need","secondary cases","RESULTS","weeks","simulated scenarios","Canadian province","hours","computational model","coming challenge","different proportions","numbers of coronavirus disease","symptom onset","BACKGROUND","characteristics","population","METHODS","half","INTERPRETATION","extent"],"language":"en"},

To address this gap, we sought to systematically evaluate the psychometric properties of measures to detect substance use and misuse. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature on measures of substance classes associated with HIV risk (heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol) that were published in English before June 2016 that reported at least one of the following psychometric outcomes of interest: internal consistency (alpha), test-retest/inter-rater reliability (kappa), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We used meta-analytic techniques to generate pooled summary estimates for these outcomes using random effects and hierarchical logistic regression models. RESULTS Findings across 387 paper revealed that overall, 65% of pooled estimates for alpha were in the range of fair-to-excellent; 44% of estimates for kappa were in the range of fair-to-excellent. In addition, 69, 97, 37 and 96% of pooled estimates for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively, were in the range of moderate-to-excellent. CONCLUSION We conclude that many substance use measures had pooled summary estimates that were at the fair/moderate-to-excellent range across different psychometric outcomes. Most scales were conducted in English, within the United States, highlighting the need to test and validate these measures in more diverse settings.

Methods: We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking. Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. Results: Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal. The median duration of illness were 23 days (P(25)-P(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (P(25)-P(75): 15-27 days). For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (P(25)-P(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days P(25)-P(75): 4-14 days). Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission. In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88). The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (aHR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.43-2.46), older age (aHR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (aHR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (aHR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (aHR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.06-2.09). Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes.

They can be used to identify and support nurses\u0027 contribution to high quality, safe, client care and are lacking in specialist intellectual disability nursing. In a national Nursing Quality Care-Metrics project for Irish intellectual disability services, a set of nursing quality care process metrics and associated indicators were established for intellectual disability services. METHODS A two-stage design approach was undertaken; a broad scoping review of the literature and a modified Delphi consensus process. The Delphi included a four round e-Delphi survey and a consensus meeting. Four hundred one intellectual disability nurses working in Ireland were recruited for the surveys and 20 stakeholders attended the consensus meeting. RESULTS From the review, 20 existing and 16 potential intellectual disability nursing metrics were identified for nurses to prioritise in the e-surveys. After the four survey rounds, 12 intellectual disability nursing metrics and 84 associated indicators were identified. Following the consensus meeting, these were reduced to 12 metrics and 79 indicators. CONCLUSIONS This first set of intellectual disability nursing process metrics and associated indicators has been identified for implementation in practice. These metrics while developed in Ireland have international relevance and their application and appropriateness in practice needs to be evaluated.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doody, Owen; Murphy, Fiona; Lyons, Rosemary; Gallen, Anne; Ryan, Judy; Downey, Johanna; Sezgin, Duygu","journal":"BMC health services research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4749-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31783758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Delphi"],"locations":["Ireland"],"keyphrases":["intellectual disability nursing process metrics","nursing care","potential intellectual disability nursing metrics","specialist intellectual disability nursing","intellectual disability nurses","set of nursing quality care process metrics","BACKGROUND Nursing process quality care metrics","national Nursing Quality Care-Metrics project","Irish intellectual disability services","associated indicators","consensus meeting","client care","modified Delphi consensus process","high quality","Ireland","round e-Delphi survey","e-surveys","practice","survey rounds","broad scoping review","literature","quantifiable measures","application","support nurses\u0027 contribution","international relevance","stage design approach","appropriateness","METHODS","stakeholders","implementation","RESULTS","clients","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Maternal malnutrition is a risk factor for maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications and is more prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review aims to study the effectiveness of antenatal macronutrient nutritional interventions on maternal, neonatal, and child outcomes. We searched the CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and other databases for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs on healthy pregnant women in LMICs. We also searched grey literature and reports from Google Scholar, Web of Science, and websites of different organizations. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction filtered 15 studies for inclusion. Balanced energy protein (BEP) supplementation (n = 8) studies showed a reduced incidence of perinatal mortality, stillbirths, low birth weight (LBW) infants, small for gestational age (SGA) babies and increased birth weight. Food distribution programs (FDPs) (n =5) witnessed reduced rates of SGA, stunting, wasting, and increased birth weight and birth length. Studies on intervention for obesity prevention (n = 2) showed reductions in birth weight. Other findings were statistically insignificant. Subgroup analyses were conducted to study the effectiveness of supplementation between regions, location, the timing of supplementation and nutritional status; however, there were a limited number of studies in each subgroup. Data from our review supports the antenatal supplementation of BEP and FDP for the prevention of adverse maternal, neonatal, and child outcomes that can be utilized for future policymaking. However, more research is required before recommending obesity prevention programs.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassi, Zohra S; Padhani, Zahra A; Rabbani, Amna; Rind, Fahad; Salam, Rehana A; Das, Jai K; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32092933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low birth weight","increased birth weight","effectiveness of supplementation","birth length","prevention of adverse maternal","antenatal supplementation of BEP","Maternal malnutrition","timing of supplementation","obesity prevention programs","neonatal complications","LMICs","child outcomes","limited number of studies","review","reduced rates of SGA","effectiveness of antenatal macronutrient nutritional interventions","text screening","abstract screening","data extraction","nutritional status","Subgroup analyses","Food distribution programs","reduced incidence of perinatal mortality","quasi-experimental designs","stillbirths","infants","LBW","randomized controlled trials","healthy pregnant women","Google Scholar","databases","gestational age","babies","Web of Science","reports","risk factor","location","stunting","Balanced energy protein","crucial role","Embase","grey literature","middle-income countries","FDPs","regions","Optimal nutrition","websites of different organizations","pregnancy","PubMed","inclusion","reductions","Title","research","future policymaking","findings"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Six burn patients combined with inhalation injury were hospitalized in Department of Burns of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University\u0026 Wuhan Third Hospital from February 1 to March 1 in 2020duringhigh-incidence period of COVID-19, including 4 males and 2 females, aged 21-63 years, hospitalized for 2-4 hours, with total burn areas of 1%-20% TBSA and full-thickness burn areas of 1%-12% TBSA. Among them, 1 case was severe inhalation injury, 2 cases were mild inhalation injury, and 3 cases were moderate inhalation injury. The body temperatures of the patients were normal at admission without fever or cough in the past 2 weeks. At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of nodules. Chest CT of two patients showed bilateral lung texture was thickening, and chest CT of other patients was normal. After admission, 6 patients were given routine treatment, the medical staffs paid attention to the protection and screened COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19. On post injury day (PID) 1, 3, 6, and 9, vein blood of patients were collected for determination of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute value. and level of procalcitonin (PCT). Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus was detected by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were recorded after admission. The results of chest CT within one week after injury and the prognosis of the patients were recorded. Measurement data distributed normally were expressed as x \u00B1 s, and measurement data distributed abnormally were expressed as M (P(25), P(75)). Results: (1) On PID1, 3, 6, and 9, WBC counts of patients were respectively (19.8\u00B13.8)\u00D710(9)/L, (17.2\u00B13.4)\u00D710(9)/L,(13.3\u00B13.1)\u00D710(9)/L, and (11.1\u00B11.6)\u00D710(9)/L, neutrophils of patients were respectively0.919\u00B10.019,0.899\u00B10.011, 0.855\u00B10.034, and0.811\u00B10.035, absolute values of lymphocytes of patients were respectively(0.65\u00B10.18)\u00D710(9)/L,(0.65\u00B10.24)\u00D710(9)/L,(0.91\u00B10.34)\u00D710(9)/L, and (1.23\u00B10.42)\u00D710(9)/L,and PCT values of patients were respectively0.49 (0.36, 1.64), 0.39 (0.26, 0.73), 0.28 (0.18, 0.33), and 0.12 (0.11, 0.20) ng/mL.The values of WBC and neutrophils of patients were higher than the normal value, showing a downward trend. The absolute values of lymphocyte of patients returned to the normal value gradually. The PCT values of patients were higher than the normal value. (2) Nucleic acid test results of novel coronavirus of 6 patients were negative on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were from 36.5 to 38.6 \u2103. The typical imaging features of COVID-19 were not found in 6 patients within 1 week after injury by chest CT. After treatment for 14-32 days, 6 patients were cured and discharged. Conclusions: During the novel coronavirus, burn patients combined with inhalation injury should be treated under condition of good protection for COVID-19 among doctors and nurses. Meanwhile, virus should be actively screened to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among doctors and patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, N N; Wang, D Y; Chen, L; Xie, W G","journal":"Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20200308-00135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268454/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","PID","WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["temperatures of patients","neutrophils of patients","PCT values of patients","WBC counts of patients","vein blood of patients","Treatment experience of burn patients","mild inhalation injury","severe inhalation injury","moderate inhalation injury","normal value","screened COVID","results of chest CT","treatment plan of COVID","values of WBC","risk of COVID","admission","post injury day","lymphocyte absolute value","absolute values of lymphocytes","duringhigh-incidence period of COVID","total burn areas","Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus","routine treatment","typical imaging features of COVID","Nucleic acid test results of novel coronavirus","cases","doctors","respectively0","Measurement data","body temperatures","TBSA","upper lobes","Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University","epidemic period of Corona Virus Disease","double lower lobes","condition of good protection","determination of white blood cell","real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","multiple slices","attention","Department of Burns","medical staffs","cough","fever","bilateral lung texture","high-density shadow of nodules","infection","diagnosis","hours","downward trend","prognosis","females","weeks","level of procalcitonin","thickness","Objective","Conclusions","nurses","days","Methods","years","PID1","and0"],"language":"en"},

The Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) has guided practitioners and patients facing difficult decisions for 20 years. It asserts that decision support interventions that address patients\u0027 decisional needs improve decision quality. Purpose. To update the ODSF based on a synthesis of evidence. Methods. We conducted an overview of systematic reviews, searching 9 electronic databases. Eligible reviews included decisional needs assessments, decision support interventions, and decisional outcome measures guided by the ODSF. We extracted data and synthesized results narratively. Eight ODSF developers/expert users from 4 disciplines revised the ODSF. Results. Of 4656 citations, we identified 4 eligible reviews (\u003E250 studies, \u003E100 different decisions, \u003E50,000 patients, 18 countries, 5 continents). They reported current ODSF decisional needs and their most frequent manifestations in the areas of inadequate knowledge/information, unclear values, decisional conflict/uncertainty, and inadequate support. They uncovered 11 new manifestations of 6 decisional needs. Using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) to assess decisional needs, average scores were elevated at baseline and declined shortly after decision making, even without information interventions. Patient decision aids were superior to usual care in reducing total DCS scores and improving decision quality. We revised the ODSF by refining definitions of 6 decisional needs and adding new interventions to address 4 needs. We added a decision process outcome and eliminated secondary outcomes unlikely to improve across a range of decisions, retaining the implementation/continuance of the chosen option and appropriate use/costs of health services. Conclusions. We updated the ODSF to reflect the current evidence and identified implications for practice and further research.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stacey, Dawn; L\u00E9gar\u00E9, France; Boland, Laura; Lewis, Krystina B; Loiselle, Marie-Chantal; Hoefel, Lauren; Garvelink, Mirjam; O\u0027Connor, Annette","journal":"Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x20911870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ODSF","DCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current ODSF decisional needs","decisional needs assessments","patients\u0027 decisional needs","decision support interventions","decision quality","decision making","ODSF developers","decisional outcome measures","Decisional Conflict Scale","decision process outcome","Ottawa Decision Support Framework","Patient decision aids","inadequate support","information interventions","new interventions","Eligible reviews","new manifestations","range of decisions","difficult decisions","different decisions","current evidence","total DCS scores","overview of systematic reviews","frequent manifestations","average scores","synthesis of evidence","synthesized results","areas of inadequate knowledge","usual care","unclear values","appropriate use","chosen option","uncertainty","secondary outcomes unlikely","implementation","continuance","practitioners","costs of health services","expert users","implications","practice","disciplines","baseline","studies","electronic databases","years","definitions","research","countries","continents","citations","Introduction","Purpose","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Besides partially implemented approaches, such as isolation areas or cluster quarantine, plans to evacuate overcrowded facilities should also be considered. The German Public Health Service (\u00D6GD) plays a vital role in the current Covid-19 pandemic. In order to fulfil their routine tasks of infection control and support health services management for refugee accommodation centres, the \u00D6GD urgently needs to be strengthened in terms of personnel and material. Additionally, means for a rapid exchange of best practice examples of Covid-19 interventions across federal states as well as collaborative structures and capacity within the \u00D6GD for accompanying operational research are needed. Refugees, their housing situation and their access to health care need to be included in pandemic plans.

Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data presented here, the strain WT00CT represents a novel species in the Herbaspirillum genus, for which the name Herbaspirillum camelliae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of H. camelliae sp. nov. is WT00CT (AB 2018017 T and KCTC 62527 T).","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xin; Zhou, Jiahui; Tian, Jinbao; Cheng, Wei; Wang, Xingguo","journal":"Archives of microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01892-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["G   C","APL","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bacterial strain WT00CT","type strain of","genus Herbaspirillum","Herbaspirillum genus","Herbaspirillum species","Herbaspirillum camelliae","anteiso-C17","anteiso-C15","genomic DNA","novel species","polar lipids","phylogenetic analysis","C content","polar flagellum","S rRNA genes","ANI values of genomic comparison","diphosphatidylglycerol","phenotypic data","genome size","endophytic bacterium","aminophospholipids","glycolipid","phosphatidylcholine","PC","phosphatidylethanolamine","DPG","microaerobic","members","AB","KCTC","tea plant","secretion system","major fatty acids","respiratory quinone","Camellia sinensis","APL","cells","total ORF","NaCl","Q8","gene cluster","mol","C16"],"language":"en"},

In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.

CASE PRESENTATION An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4\u00BA C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient\u0027s health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome.

The aim of this study is to determine the midterm results and the safety of laparoscopic resizing of the gastric pouch after RYGB in cases where gastric pouch is \u003E 200 ml and/or GJ anastomosis \u003E 20 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent gastric pouch resizing between January 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by \u211Bc), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy \u2265 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngonghala, Calistus N; Iboi, Enahoro; Eikenberry, Steffen; Scotch, Matthew; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Bonds, Matthew H; Gumel, Abba B","journal":"Mathematical biosciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["burden of COVID","pandemic burden","strict social-distancing measures","masks coverage","surgical masks","strict social-distancing strategy","use of low efficacy masks","low efficacy cloth masks","masks-based intervention","distancing protocols","use of efficacious face-masks","burden similar","important role social-distancing plays","adherence level of social","significant reduction of COVID","timely implementation of social","estimated efficacy","use of face","baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions","study","elimination","US state of New York","devastating public health impact","intervention strategies","coverage level","new mathematical model","entire US","residents of New York state","population-level impact","mitigation strategies","improved levels","transmission dynamics","community transmission","early termination","dramatic reduction","cumulative mortality","aforementioned control","effective vaccine","isolation","quarantine","data relevant","contact-tracing","relaxation","numerous states","certain epidemiological threshold","worst-case scenario projections","antivirals","world","catastrophic outcome","respect","wave","decreases","onset","reproduction number","future trajectory","\u211Bc","absence","timing","disease-free equilibrium","duration","Rigorous analysis","Simulations","novel Coronavirus","compliance","end"],"language":"en"},

Airborne bacteria samples were collected in 12 classrooms, in 12 living rooms and four bathrooms in two dormitory buildings, and in a dining hall. The results showed that the microenvironment in the female dormitory had the highest mean bacterial concentration (2847 CFU/m3), whereas the lowest mean bacterial concentration was observed in classrooms (162 CFU/m3). Indoor bacterial concentrations in male dormitories were significantly lower than in female dormitories probably because of crowding and increased ventilation. Outdoor weather conditions were associated with the indoor concentrations with regard to insufficient ventilation and varying outdoor concentration. The occupants\u0027 activity level was also more closely related to the indoor bacteria concentration in the residential setting.

METHODS Seven datebases were searched to collect studies about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2020. Then, meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS A total of 38 studies involving 3 062 COVID-19 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (56.9%). The incidence rate of respiratory failure or ARDS was 19.5% and the fatality rate was 5.5%. Fever (80.4%), fatigue (46%), cough (63.1%) and expectoration (41.8%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included muscle soreness (33%), anorexia (38.8%), chest tightness (35.7%), shortness of breath (35%), dyspnea (33.9%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.9%), headache (15.4%), pharyngalgia(13.1%), shivering (10.9%) and abdominal pain (4.4%). Patients with asymptomatic was 11.9%. Normal leukocytes counts (69.7%), lymphopenia (56.5%), elevated C-reactive protein levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%) and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients. About 37.2% of patients with elevated D-dimer, 25.9% of patients with leukopenia, along with abnormal levels of liver function (29%) and renal function (25.5%). Other findings included leukocytosis (12.6%) and elevated procalcitonin (17.5%). Only 25.8% of patients had lesions involving single lung and 75.7% of patients had lesions involving bilateral lungs. CONCLUSIONS The most commonly experienced symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, fatigue, cough and expectoration. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocytes counts, lymphopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and ESR. Bilateral lungs involvement was common. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, two well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus (CMN 8920 and CMN 8919) are CT scanned to describe their neurosensory structures and infer sensory capability. The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment. This analysis also demonstrates that birds, non-avian archosauromorphs, and lepidosaurs possess significantly different canal morphologies, and represents the first morphometric analysis of semicircular canals across Diapsida.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dudgeon, Thomas W; Maddin, Hillary C; Evans, David C; Mallon, Jordan C","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63956-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["semicircular canals of Champsosaurus","isolated Champsosaurus","braincase","shapes of semicircular canals","well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus","morphometric analysis of semicircular canals","lepidosaurs","CMN","aquatic environment","aquatic reptiles","anterior portion","posterior portion","non-avian archosauromorphs","Upper Cretaceous sediments of North America","pars inferior","neurosensory structures","expansion","animals","birds","inner ear","sensing movement","Diapsida","different canal morphologies","otic notch","impressions","fragility","sensory capability","Comparison","low frequency sounds","olfactory stalks","absence","visualization","extinct diapsids","good olfaction","skulls"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY The study included 153 S. maltophilia strains isolated from clinical samples sent to our hospital laboratory between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2018. The bacteria were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity was determined using the VITEK-2 automated system. PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis): The strains isolated from 34 patient clinical samples and from 1 patient bedcover were taken for PFGE examination. RESULTS The TMP/SXT and levofloxacin sensitivity of 153 S. maltophilia strains was examined. TMP/SXT resistance was determined to be 39% and levofloxacin resistance at 5%. Among 35 S. maltophilia strains, seven genotypes were identified using the PFGE method. While three strains showed a specific genotype profile, the other 32 were determined to consist of four clusters. The cluster rate was therefore 91.4% (32/35). CONCLUSIONS There was a clonal relationship between the vast majority of the 35 S. maltophilia isolates, which suggests that there was a cross-contamination problem in the hospital. One strain (#4) was identified by dendrogram analysis showed a high rate of similarity to the other strains and was determined to be the common source of the cross-contamination.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C7al\u0131\u015Fkan, Ahmet; \u00C7opur \u00C7icek, Ay\u015Feg\u00FCl; Aydogan Ejder, Nebahat; Karag\u00F6z, Alper; Kiri\u015Fci, \u00D6zlem; K\u0131l\u0131\u00E7, Sel\u00E7uk","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.11171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis","PFGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maltophilia strains","maltophilia isolates","hospital infections","INTRODUCTION Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","patient clinical samples","levofloxacin sensitivity","hospital laboratory","PFGE examination","PFGE method","TMP","levofloxacin resistance","SXT resistance","cross-contamination problem","patient bedcover","antibiotic sensitivity","cluster rate","high rate of similarity","Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis","vast majority","clonal relationship","VITEK","pneumonia","agent","genotypes","dendrogram analysis","complications","bacteremia","common source","specific genotype profile","study","result","death","automated system","CONCLUSIONS","bacteria","METHODOLOGY","biofilm","catheters","clusters"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies. While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yaacoub, Sally; Sch\u00FCnemann, Holger J; Khabsa, Joanne; El-Harakeh, Amena; Khamis, Assem M; Chamseddine, Fatimah; El Khoury, Rayane; Saad, Zahra; Hneiny, Layal; Cuello Garcia, Carlos; Muti-Sch\u00FCnemann, Giovanna Elsa Ute; Bognanni, Antonio; Chen, Chen; Chen, Guang; Zhang, Yuan; Zhao, Hong; Abi Hanna, Pierre; Loeb, Mark; Piggott, Thomas; Reinap, Marge; Rizk, Nesrine; Stalteri, Rosa; Duda, Stephanie; Solo, Karla; Chu, Derek K; Akl, Elie A","journal":"BMJ global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evidence relevant","handling of bodies","identified strategies","primary evidence","direct evidence","effects of specific strategies","relevant organisations","relevant systematic reviews","bodies of deceased persons","dead bodies","low-certainty evidence","practical advice","study design reporting","INTRODUCTION Proper strategies","substantive number of guidance documents","individuals","confirmed COVID","steps","included papers","specific electronic databases","novel coronavirus","risk of infection","coronavirus disease","risk of transmission","single reviewer","review highlights major research gaps","patients","autopsies","websites of governmental","safety","reference lists","efficacy","Epistemonikos","use of personal protective equipment","severe acute respiratory syndrome","interested entities","uncommon strategy","pilot-tested form","contextual factors","management","registries of clinical trials","CONCLUSION","preparation","packing","coronaviruses","GRADE approach","acceptability","nCoV","assessments","literature","METHODS","objective"],"language":"en"},

Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections. In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. METHODS The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database. The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application. CONCLUSIONS Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.

Bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC, has been demonstrated to be involved in the susceptibility to parasite infections. However, few studies have analyzed this connection in more depth. The aim of this study was to determine if early BPA exposure in female mice affects the systemic immune response and the susceptibility to T. crassiceps infection. METHODS AND RESULTS BALB/cice were exposed to BPA at postnatal day 3. At 6 weeks of age, they were inoculated with T. crassiceps larvae, and 2 weeks later, were euthanized. The number of parasites was quantified. By flow cytometry, in the spleen, the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, the different innate and adaptive immune cell modulation was analyzed, and RT-PCR cytokine expression was also evaluated. BPA induced a reduction of 40% in parasite load. BPA treatment modulated some lineages of the innate immune response and caused slight changes in cells belonging to the adaptive immune response. Additionally, BPA enhanced the type 2 cytokine profile.

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. The changes of lymphocytes were studied further with immunohistochemistry.RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCov RNA in the spleen. In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. Results: There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years. Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively. Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms. The time from onset to death was 15-45 days. 10 cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death. Five patients\u0027 peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients\u0027 peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone \u226440 mg/d, not more than 5 days). Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent; in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees. In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found. Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case. Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocytic apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees. CD20(\u002B)B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases. However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic. CD3(\u002B), CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells were decreased. In 9 cases,CD68\u002B macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity. While more CD68\u002B cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection). Few CD56(\u002B) cells were found. EBV was negative by in situ hybridization. RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCov virus. One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old, who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. Conclusion: The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases. Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19. T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly. And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, X; Chang, X N; Pan, H X; Su, H; Huang, B; Yang, M; Luo, D J; Weng, M X; Ma, L; Nie, X","journal":"Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200401-00278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Macrophage","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases patients","spleen infarction","T cells","B cells","pathological changes","significant changes","death of COVID","patients\u0027 peripheral blood lymphocyte count","number of white pulp","varying degrees","nCov virus","number of NK cells","changes of lymphocytes","B lymphocyte components","peripheral blood leukocyte count","splenic artery","lymphoid follicles","direct attack of virus","significant increase","ratio of red pulp","early stage","attack of immune system","addition","splenic lesions","coronavirus particles","splenic nodules","Epstein-Barr virus","lymphoid sheath","EBV","situ hybridization","fungal infection","CD20","CD68","results of immunohistochemistry","RT-PCR","underlying diseases","days","weakened immune system","slight increase","cell composition","electron microscope","cytoplasm of macrophage","years old","Macrophage proliferation","scattered plasma cell infiltration","neutrophil infiltration","nCov RNA","small artery thrombosis","transmission electron microscopy","use of low dose corticosteroid","dyspnea","malaise","different levels","hemophagocytic phenomena","main clinical symptoms","macrophages","youngest patient","nucleic acid","eosin","females","Cough","fever","average age","Histopathological examination","relationship","invasive autopsies","lymphocytic apoptosis","group","distribution","quantity","CD8","methylprednisolone","CD21 immunostaining","medullary sinuses","Routine hematoxylin","cancer history","CD4","Methods","necrosis","time","onset","tissues","Conclusion","Objective","organs","elderly","CD3","Wuhan","CD56"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes after LPG-DFT and LSTG. METHODS Patients who underwent LPG-DFT or LSTG at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo between January 2006 and April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Operative procedures were selected based on the distance from the cardia to the proximal boundary of the tumour, tumour location and predicted remnant stomach volume. Patient characteristics, surgical data, markers of postoperative nutritional status, such as blood chemistry and bodyweight loss, and endoscopic findings were compared between procedures. The main study outcome was nutritional status. RESULTS A total of 161 patients (LPG-DFT 51, LSTG 110) were included. Types of postoperative complication occurring more than 30 days after surgery differed between the two procedures. Remnant stomach ulcers, including anastomotic ulcers, were observed only after LPG-DFT, whereas complications involving the small intestine, such as internal hernia or small bowel obstruction, occurred more frequently after LSTG. Values for total protein, albumin, prealbumin and bodyweight loss were comparable between the two procedures at 36 months after surgery. Haemoglobin concentrations were higher after LPG-DFT than after LSTG at 24 months (13\u00B74 versus 12\u00B78 g/dl respectively; P = 0\u00B7045) and 36 months (13\u00B75 versus 12\u00B78 g/dl; P = 0\u00B7007) after surgery. The rate of Los Angeles grade B or more severe reflux oesophagitis was comparable. CONCLUSION LPG-DFT and LSTG for proximal early gastric cancer have similar outcomes, but different types of complication.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kano, Y; Ohashi, M; Ida, S; Kumagai, K; Sano, T; Hiki, N; Nunobe, S","journal":"BJS open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LSTG","Cancer Institute Hospital"],"locations":["Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["LSTG","CONCLUSION LPG-DFT","laparoscopic total gastrectomy","months","surgery","proximal early gastric cancer","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy","proximal boundary","Operative procedures","laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy","bodyweight loss","Remnant stomach ulcers","total protein","Types of postoperative complication","retrospective study","markers of postoperative nutritional status","Cancer Institute Hospital","different types of complication","main study outcome","tumour location","similar outcomes","long-term outcomes","predicted remnant stomach volume","small intestine","anastomotic ulcers","METHODS Patients","small bowel obstruction","LTG","surgical data","double-flap technique","severe reflux oesophagitis","internal hernia","rate of Los Angeles grade B","blood chemistry","prealbumin","endoscopic findings","Patient characteristics","complications","Haemoglobin concentrations","Values","Tokyo","cardia","days","distance","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, information on the current utilization of oral anticonceptives and attitudes toward their use remains sparse. OBJECTIVE The present study evaluated the utilization pattern of oral anticonceptives, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects among Saudi women. SETTING The study was conducted in a community setting in Jazan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS Eligible Saudi women routinely using oral anticonceptive pills were invited to participate in this prospective, cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using a standardized, pretested, semi-structured questionnaire. Jazan was selected as it recorded the highest number of women using contraceptives in Saudi Arabia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The pattern of pill utilization, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects. RESULTS A total of 496 women consented to participate in this study. Most of the respondents (87.5%) were using or had used oral anticonceptives for birth control. In nearly half (49.2%) of participants, oral pills were advised by a gynaecologist, and approximately two-thirds (69.0%) were using or had used combined oral anticonceptives. Nearly two-thirds (63.1%) of respondents preferred pills over other contraception methods due to their ease of use. More than one-third (39.3%) of participants agreed that oral pills are safe. Approximately half (53.2%) of participants were aware that a missed pill must be taken immediately after recalling that a dose was missed. A total of 69.6% of participants experienced at least one side effect, of which mood swings (61.1%), weight gain or increase appetite (42.2%), decreased libido (34.1%), and nausea (31.2%) were most common. CONCLUSION Saudi women had a high acceptance rate for oral anticonceptives as a legitimate method to prevent unintended pregnancy. This was associated with a modest degree of understanding about their risks and benefits. Pharmacists should provide up-to-date information and counsel patients about the use and side effects of oral anticonceptives.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yasmeen, Ayesha; Syed, Mamoon H; Meraya, Abdulkarim M; Albarraq, Ahmed A; Makeen, Hafiz A; Alqahtani, Saad S; Abubaker, Mawada; Syed, Nabeel Kashaan A","journal":"International journal of clinical pharmacy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-020-01046-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["use of oral anticonceptives","oral pills","effects of oral anticonceptives","combined oral anticonceptives","utilization pattern of oral anticonceptives","current utilization of oral anticonceptives","pill use","oral anticonceptive pills","CONCLUSION Saudi women","participants","ease of use","METHODS Eligible Saudi women","pattern of pill utilization","Saudi Arabian community","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","missed pill","highest number of women","incidence","community setting","present study","Jazan","respondents","thirds","total","half","socio-demographic pattern","contraception methods","up-to-date information","birth control","notable increase","high acceptance rate","attitudes","legitimate method","beliefs","counsel patients","contraceptives","rapid change","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE","risks","fertility","modest degree of understanding","appetite","semi-structured questionnaire","BACKGROUND","unintended pregnancy","Pharmacists","OBJECTIVE","gynaecologist","weight gain","mood swings","cross-sectional survey","benefits","decreased libido","Data","dose","nausea"],"language":"en"},

Many triage policies exist that fall under the legal protections afforded by \u0022crisis standards of care,\u0022 but they have key differences. We critically appraise one of the most fundamental differences among policies, namely the use of criteria to categorically exclude certain patients from eligibility for otherwise standard medical services. We examine these categorical exclusion criteria from ethical, legal, disability, and implementation perspectives. Focusing our analysis on the most common type of exclusion criteria, which are disease-specific, we conclude that optimal policies for critical care resource allocation and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not use categorical exclusions. We argue that the avoidance of categorical exclusions is often practically feasible, consistent with public health norms, and mitigates discrimination against persons with disabilities.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Auriemma, Catherine L; Molinero, Ashli M; Houtrow, Amy J; Persad, Govind; White, Douglas B; Halpern, Scott D","journal":"The American journal of bioethics : AJOB","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1764141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health ethic","public health norms","public health crises","health systems","use of criteria","population health","categorical exclusion criteria","optimal policies","triage policies","avoidance of categorical exclusions","common type of exclusion criteria","use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation","resource scarcity","critical care resource allocation","certain patients","legal protections","key differences","fundamental differences","well-being of individual patients","crisis standards of care","usual clinical ethic","pandemic","contagion risks","COVID","eligibility","disability","discrimination","CPR","standard medical services","degree","disease-specific","persons","implementation perspectives","disabilities","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The interference factors causing false-positive reactivity in the two methods were analyzed, and the urea dissociation test was employed to dissociate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive serum using the best dissociation concentration.Results: Two methods detected positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 22 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and 14 sera from COVID-19 patients; the other 50 sera were negative.

There is increasing evidence for p57 to control cellular processes in addition to cell cycle and CDK regulation including transcription, apoptosis, migration or development. In order to obtain molecular insights to unknown functions of p57, we performed a protein interaction screen. We identified the transcription regulator four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel p57-binding protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays were used to elucidate the physiological and functional relevance of p57/FHL2 interaction. We found in cancer cells that endogenous p57 and FHL2 are in a complex. We observed a substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters by p57 in reporter gene experiments and detected strong induction of the intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and binding of exogenous FHL2 to HDACs indicated repression of FHL2 transcription activity by HDACs. In the presence of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2 by p57 is abrogated suggesting that p57 shares a common pathway with HDAC inhibitors. p57 competes with HDACs for FHL2 binding which might partly explain the mechanism of FHL2 activation by p57. These results suggest a novel function of p57 in transcription regulation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kullmann, Michael Keith; Podmirseg, Silvio Roland; Roilo, Martina; Hengst, Ludger","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62641-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cip/Kip","CDK","HDAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FHL2 binding","endogenous p57","FHL2 interaction","novel p57-binding protein","binding of exogenous FHL2","novel function of p57","functional relevance of p57","unknown functions of p57","mechanism of FHL2 activation","repression of FHL2 transcription activity","intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2","HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2","HDAC inhibitors","transcription regulation","HDACs","substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters","transcription regulator","reporter gene experiments","reporter gene assays","protein interaction screen","eukaryotic cell cycle","strong induction","CDK regulation","cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors","cancer cells","Treatment of cells","Kip family of CKIs","addition","cellular processes","histone deacetylase","genomic mutations","molecular insights","apoptosis","member","human overgrowth disorders","presence","Co-immunoprecipitation","migration","common pathway","development","evidence","results","half LIM","p57Kip2","complex"],"language":"en"},

It has multiple respiratory side effects, but acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rare complication. We describe here the case of a woman with breast cancer who developed ARDS 1 week after her final radiotherapy session. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old female with breast cancer presented 1 week after her final session of radiotherapy. She had developed a sudden onset of hypotension unresponsive to fluids, oxygen desaturation unresponsive to high flow oxygen, and new bilateral infiltrates had appeared on chest x-ray (CXR) predominant in the left upper lobe, which was interestingly the main area affected by the radiotherapy beams. A diagnosis of atypical ARDS secondary to radiotherapy was established. She was intubated and a low tidal volume/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy was utilized to manage her condition. After 48 hours, the infiltrates diminished remarkably, and she was extubated the following day. On discharge, she had a completely normal CXR; a computed tomography (CT) chest performed 1 month later showed complete resolution of the alveolar opacities. CONCLUSIONS ARDS remains an extremely rare complication of thoracic radiotherapy. However, physicians must be wary of its development in order to diagnose it quickly and treat accordingly.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alhaddad, Juliano B; Bleibel, Jerar Z; Hoteit, Mayssaa; Bou Harb, Souad; Haddad, Youssef B","journal":"The American journal of case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.919477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Radiotherapy","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["radiotherapy beams","BACKGROUND Radiotherapy","final radiotherapy session","final session of radiotherapy","breast cancer","rare complication of thoracic radiotherapy","CONCLUSIONS ARDS","week","diagnosis of atypical ARDS secondary","high flow oxygen","oxygen desaturation unresponsive","chest x-ray","normal CXR","CASE REPORT","following day","new bilateral infiltrates","sudden onset of hypotension unresponsive","acute respiratory distress syndrome","high positive end-expiratory pressure","fluids","surgical resection","effects","year-old female","low tidal volume","PEEP","computed tomography","adjuvant therapy","complete resolution","primary malignant tumor","strategy","left upper lobe","month","woman","main area","development","alveolar opacities","physicians","order","condition","discharge","hours"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we have shown that N-glycosylation of recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of IBV-M41 is of critical importance for binding to chicken trachea tissue. Here we investigated the role of N-glycosylation of the RBD on receptor specificity and virus replication in the context of the virus particle. Using our reverse genetics system we were able to generate recombinant IBVs for nine-out-of-ten individual N-glycosylation mutants. In vitro growth kinetics of these viruses were comparable to the virus containing the wild-type M41-S1. Furthermore, Neu5Ac binding by the recombinant viruses containing single N-glycosylation site knock-out mutations matched the Neu5Ac binding observed with the recombinant RBDs. Five N-glycosylation mutants lost the ability to bind Neu5Ac and gained binding to a different, yet unknown, sialylated glycan receptor on host cells. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation of IBV is a determinant for receptor specificity.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouwman, K M; Habraeken, N; Laconi, A; Berends, A J; Groenewoud, L; Alders, M; Kemp, V; Verheije, M H","journal":"The Journal of general virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Neu5Ac binding","individual N-glycosylation mutants","role of N","receptor specificity","single N-glycosylation site knock","recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain","sialic acid receptor Neu5Ac","virus replication","spike of IBV","recombinant viruses","virus particle","N-glycosylated attachment protein spike","sialylated glycan receptor","recombinant RBDs","recombinant IBVs","Infection of chicken coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","chicken trachea tissue","wild-type M41-S1","critical importance","alpha","context","mutations","ability","host cells","determinant","reverse genetics system","growth kinetics","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States. New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education. Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing. We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents. RESULTS Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum. CONCLUSION It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis.

Identifying indicators of hospital admission for Covid-19 patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions. Self-reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of Covid-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory-confirmed positive Covid-19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia. RESULTS A total of 169 patients tested positive for Covid-19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128/169 (75.7%) subjects of which 26/128 (20.1%) required hospitalization. Admission for Covid-19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, as well as subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure. On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (aOR 0.09 95% CI: 0.01-0.74) while positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01 95% CI: 1.12-57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission.

This review summarizes data describing the inactivation efficacy of amotosalen/UVA-PRT for a broad spectrum of viruses and parasites. METHODS Twenty-five enveloped viruses, six nonenveloped viruses (NEVs), and four parasites species were evaluated for sensitivity to amotosalen/UVA-PRT. Pathogens were spiked into plasma and PC at high titers. Samples were collected before and after PRT and assessed for infectivity with cell cultures or animal models. Log reduction factors (LRFs) were defined as the difference in infectious titers before and after amotosalen/UV-PRT. RESULTS LRFs of \u22654.0 log were reported for 19 pathogens in plasma (range, \u22654.0 to \u22657.6), 28 pathogens in PC in platelet additive solution (PC-PAS; \u22654.1-\u22657.8), and 14 pathogens in PC in 100% plasma (PC-100%; (\u22654.3-\u003E8.4). Twenty-five enveloped viruses and two NEVs were sensitive to amotosalen/UV-PRT; LRF ranged from \u003E2.9 to \u22657.6 in plasma, 2.4 or greater to greater than 6.9 in PC-PAS and \u003E3.5 to \u003E6.5 in PC-100%. Infectious titers for four parasites were reduced by \u003E4.0 log in all PC and plasma (\u22654.9 to \u003E8.4).

METHODS Patients were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Demographic data, tumor types, and the perioperative outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In a 10-year period, 75 patients (female, n = 44; male, n = 31; median age, 53 years [range, 9-84 years]) were identified. The majority of patients had pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (n = 39, 52%) and cystic neoplasms (n = 23, 31%) with a median tumor size of 17 (3-60) mm. Nineteen (25.3%) patients underwent enucleation (robotic, n = 11; laparoscopic, n = 8) and 56 (74.7%) patients underwent distal pancreatic resection (robotic, n = 24; laparoscopic, n = 32), of those 48 (85%) underwent spleen-preserving procedures. Eight (10.7%) procedures had to be converted to open surgery. The rate of vessel preservation in distal pancreatectomy was significantly higher in robotic-assisted procedures (62.5% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.01). Twenty-six (34.6%) patients experienced postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade \u003E 3). Twenty (26.7%) patients developed a pancreatic fistula type B. There was no mortality. After a median follow-up period of 58 months (range 2-120 months), one patient (1.3%) developed local recurrence (glucagonoma) after enucleation, which was treated with a Whipple procedure. CONCLUSION The robotic approach is comparably safe, but increases the rate of splenic vessel preservation and reduces the risk of conversion to open surgery.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Najafi, Nawid; Mintziras, I; Wiese, D; Albers, M B; Maurer, E; Bartsch, D K","journal":"Surgery today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-01966-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32016613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["majority of patients","METHODS Patients","laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection","enucleation","benign pancreatic neoplasms","pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms","robotic approach","procedures","pancreatic fistula type","distal pancreatectomy","rate of vessel preservation","range","months","median follow-up period","median age","median tumor size","cystic neoplasms","open surgery","years","rate of splenic vessel preservation","tumor types","year period","postoperative complications","risk of conversion","female","Clavien-Dindo grade","local recurrence","Demographic data","perioperative outcomes","glucagonoma","present study","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","mortality","RESULTS","Whipple procedure","spleen","database"],"language":"en"},

Whilst MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East, no cases of MERS-CoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj. SUMMARY Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity in pilgrims attending mass gathering events. The management of severe respiratory infections should consider investigation and empirical coverage for the most likely agents based on syndromic surveillance data from hosting country and /or other relevant exposure history during events.

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P \u003C .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saitoh, Akihiko; Sato, Kiyomi; Magara, Yoko; Osaki, Kakuei; Narita, Kiyoko; Shioiri, Kumiko; Fowler, Karen E; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay","journal":"Journal of hospital medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Niigata","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Hand hygiene observations","multimodal hand hygiene intervention","BACKGROUND Hand hygiene","multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates","hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers","percentage points","current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates","postintervention observations","Intervention components","hospital setting","preintervention observations","nurses","Hospital B","patient observations preintervention","Japanese hospitals","tertiary hospitals","Hospitals D","postintervention study","physicians","HCWs","spread of COVID","Niigata","OBJECTIVES","Improvement","hospitalized patients","healthcare-associated infection","spread of respiratory viruses","MEASURES","changes","CONCLUSIONS","novel coronavirus","World Health Organization","PARTICIPANTS","doctors","MAIN OUTCOMES","previous studies","RESULTS","DESIGN","concern"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A multidisciplinary working group formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach. RESULTS Two of the questions were based on randomized studies and one on professional consensus. The guideline recommends cemental augmentation for painful vertebral lesions in patients with malignant diagnosis, either hematological or non-hematological. Fracture of the posterior wall is not a contradiction to cemental augmentation, but care should always be taken while injecting the cement, to decrease the risk of cemental leaks into the spinal canal. CONCLUSION The recommendations are based on low-to-moderate quality of evidence or professional consensus as well as patient preferences and positive and harmful effects of the intervention. The working group recommends more randomized studies on patients with different malignant diseases and painful vertebral lesions comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty and conservative treatment to confirm the conclusion in this guideline.

At present, the traditional methods for identifying genetically modified and non-transgenic soybeans are time-consuming, costly, and complicated to operate, which cannot meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a fast and accurate method for identifying transgenic soybeans. Terahertz (THz) time domain spectra were collected in sequence from 225 transgenic and non-transgenic soybean samples. Fourier transform was used to convert the terahertz time domain spectrum into a THz frequency domain spectrum with a frequency range of 0.1-2.5 THz. Firstly, the interval partial least squares (iPLS) method was used to remove interference spectral bands and select appropriate spectral intervals. Secondly, 168 samples were selected as the calibration set. Discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), Grid Search support vector machine (Grid Search-SVM) and principal component analysis back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) were used to establish a qualitative identification model. Afterwards, 57 test set samples were predicted. By comparing the experimental results, it was found that iPLS could effectively screen and remove the interference THz band, which was more helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the identification model. After the iPLS and mean center pre-treatment technology, the Grid Search-SVM identification model had the best identification effect, with a total accuracy rate of 98.25% (transgenic identification rate was 96.15%, non-transgenic identification rate was 100%). This study shows that after selecting spectra from iPLS, THz spectroscopy combined with chemometrics can more accurately, quickly, and efficiently identify transgenic and non-transgenic soybeans.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Xiao; Zheng, Wanqin; Zhu, Shiping; Zhou, Shengling; Wu, Weiji; Xie, Zhiyong","journal":"Spectrochimica acta.

The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in Chinese population was 4%. OBJECTIVES To describe process of hospitalization and critical care of decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS This was a multi-center observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020. RESULTS The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, and 35 (32.1%) patients were female. 85 (78.0%) patients suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities. Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at early stage of disease. Overall, from onset of symptom to death, the mean time was 22.3 days. All 109 hospitalized patients needed ICU admission, however, only 51 (46.8%) had such a chance because of limited availability. The period of hospitalization to death in ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (SD, 8.8 days) and 12.5 days (8.6 days, P = 0.044), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in old people whose age was always above 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities. Patients admitted to ICU lived longer than those who did not gain admission to ICU. Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially ICU resource allocation.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Rong-Hui; Liu, Li-Min; Yin, Wen; Wang, Wen; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yuan, Ming-Li; Li, Yu-Lei; Hu, Yi; Li, Xu-Yan; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong","journal":"Annals of the American Thoracic Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202003-225oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pneumonia","days","ICU admission","non-ICU group","overall death rate of COVID","hospitalized patients","current outbreak of COVID","ICU resource allocation","respiratory failure","heart failure","Wuhan","mean age","years","critical care of decedents","Multiple organ failure","process of hospitalization","period of hospitalization","clinical management","mean time","major comorbidities","underlying comorbidities","infections","multi-center observational study","spreads","China","laboratory","recognition","SARS-CoV","SD","international borders","METHODS","treatment data","onset of symptom","early stage of disease","RATIONALE","old people","Chinese population","hospitals","CONCLUSIONS Mortality","chance","limited availability","final date of follow-up","Demographic","OBJECTIVES","findings","female"],"language":"en"},

In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking. By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home. We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Joanna; Wilkinson, Claire","journal":"Drug and alcohol review","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["home drinking","COVID","health harms","social harms","licensing systems","premise outlets","countries","premise consumption","alcohol providers","designation of outlets","UK governments\u0027 responses","sharp focus long-standing weaknesses","heightened risks","services","pandemic","movement","people","regulation","new ways","pubs","hotels","restaurants","Australia","critical conversations","intensification","current situation","context of restrictions","customers","responsibility","future"],"language":"en"},

Industry 4.0 is known as the fourth industrial revolution, which has the potential to fulfil customised requirement during COVID-19 crisis. This revolution has started with the applications of advance manufacturing and digital information technologies. METHODS A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID-19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate. RESULTS We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper. The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID-19 patients. We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus. It is useful to provide day to day update of an infected patient, area-wise, age-wise and state-wise with proper surveillance systems. We also believe that the proper implementation of these technologies would help to enhance education and communication regarding public health. These Industry 4.0 technologies could provide a lot of innovative ideas and solution for fighting local and global medical emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javaid, Mohd; Haleem, Abid; Vaishya, Raju; Bahl, Shashi; Suman, Rajiv; Vaish, Abhishek","journal":"Diabetes \u0026 metabolic syndrome","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["useful technologies of Industry","available technologies of Industry","major technologies of Industry","advance information technologies applications","digital information technologies","CONCLUSIONS Industry","AIMS COVID","management of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","pandemic","proper controlling","proper implementation","proper surveillance systems","state-wise","area-wise","age-wise","applications of advance manufacturing","healthcare systems","customised requirement","day update","related problems","industrial revolution","essential healthcare equipment","requirements of customised face masks","surge demand","solution","SCOPUS","databases of PubMed","medicines","infected patient","gloves","Coronavirus","Google Scholar","appropriate search words","potential","lot of innovative ideas","Research Gate","literature","education","global medical emergencies","METHODS","detailed review","communication","public health","BACKGROUND","crisis","detection","symptoms","patients","paper"],"language":"en"},

Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer\u0027s patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer\u0027s patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer\u0027s patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer\u0027s patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bostanciklioglu, Mehmet; Temiz, Ebru","journal":"Current neurovascular research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666200522220509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mao"],"organizations":["SARS","Transgenic"],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS CoV","presence of SARS","affected patients","lockdown of patients","penetration potential of SARS","medical comorbidities of patients","severe respiratory symptoms","neurologic findings","common symptoms","routine examination of Alzheimer\u0027s patients","dramatic neurologic symptoms","clinic studies of AD","potential target of COVID","ongoing pandemic of COVID","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","dementia researchers","clinical studies","arrest of experimental studies","affected dementia research","people","countries","death of expensive transgenic animals","new-onset neurologic symptoms","coronavirus infectious disease","loss of sense","brain tissue","Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","data loss","seizure","Transgenic models","neuronal death","early findings","experimental achievements","stroke","closing of universities","altered sense of smell","clinic trials","international researchers","important implications","nonspecific manifestations","late stage","express ACE","real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings","emergency action plan","accounting","increased mortality rate","pharmaceutical companies","immunohistochemistry","depressed level of consciousness","years","neurons","enzyme","rigorous quarantine of elders","chaos","headache","dizziness","outbreak","taste","electron microscopy","central nervous system","human angiotensin","catastrophic effects","direct relation","visa problems","receptors","hyposmia","table","costly consequences","midst","challenges","laboratory staff","neurology clinics","cerebrospinal fluid","olfactory epithelium","tremendous efforts","social distancing","contract","storm","Glial cells","suggestions","Wuhan","China","globe","writing","cribriform plate","neurologists","infection","doubt","Mao","isolating patients","protection of dementia patients","patients of phase trails","interaction of Alzheimer\u0027s patients","extended lockdown of patients","dementia studies","equipped nursing homes","telemedicine","future of dementia research","researchers","appropriate strategy","research funders","clinic trails","appropriate exit strategy","COVID","depression","motivations of clinicians","nursing home capacity","Young family members","older family members","example","AD symptoms","Data loss","objective data","consortium of pharmaceutical companies","collective action plan","global action plan","trials of gantenerumab","experimental studies","hand hygiene","continuation of clinical trials","healthy young people","lead of expected problems","lead of possible solutions","planned ending dates of phase","basic needs","project deadlines","secondary risk factors","Roche","United States","pets","social isolation","additional promotion","condition","use of technology","attention","qualified personnel","penetration","directions of neurologists","catastrophic atmosphere","solanezumab","elders","movement restriction","forecasting","pandemic","dangerous scenario","rural areas","Remote monitoring","monitorization","Lilly","Governments","media","caregivers","surprise","way","cats","glance"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed at assessing the role of ICU-acquired weakness on extubation failure and the relation between limb weakness and cough strength. METHODS A secondary analysis of two previous prospective studies including patients at high risk of reintubation after a planned extubation, i.e., age greater than 65 years, with underlying cardiac or respiratory disease, or intubated for more than 7 days prior to extubation. Patients intubated less than 24 h and those with a do-not-reintubate order were not included. Limb and cough strength were assessed by a physiotherapist just before extubation. ICU-acquired weakness was clinically diagnosed as limb weakness defined as Medical Research Council (MRC) score \u003C 48 points and severe weakness as MRC sum-score \u003C 36. Cough strength was assessed using a semi-quantitative 5-Likert scale. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation or death within the first 7 days following extubation. RESULTS Among 344 patients at high risk of reintubation, 16% experienced extubation failure (56/344). They had greater severity and lower MRC sum-score (41 \u00B1 16 vs. 49 \u00B1 13, p \u003C 0.001) and were more likely to have ineffective cough than the others. The prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness at the time of extubation was 38% (130/244). The extubation failure rate was 12% (25/214) in patients with no limb weakness vs. 18% (12/65) and 29% (19/65) in those with moderate and severe limb weakness, respectively (p \u003C 0.01). MRC sum-score and cough strength were weakly but significantly correlated (rho = 0.28, p \u003C .001). After multivariate logistic regression analyses, the lower the MRC sum-score the greater the risk of reintubation; severe limb weakness was independently associated with extubation failure, even after adjustment on cough strength and severity at admission. CONCLUSION ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 38% in this population of patients at high risk at the time of extubation and was independently associated with extubation failure in the ICU.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thille, Arnaud W; Boissier, Florence; Muller, Michel; Levrat, Albrice; Bourdin, Ga\u00EBl; Rosselli, Sylv\u00E8ne; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Coudroy, R\u00E9mi; Vivier, Emmanuel","journal":"Critical care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-2807-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRC","Medical Research Council","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time of extubation","planned extubation","experienced extubation failure","extubation failure rate","severe weakness","severe limb weakness","cough strength","lower MRC sum-score","high risk of reintubation","ventilated patients","population of patients","ineffective cough","role of ICU","prevalence of ICU","CONCLUSION ICU","greater severity","age greater","days","previous prospective studies","relation","Medical Research Council","points","secondary analysis","years","multivariate logistic regression analyses","adjustment","influence","respiratory disease","Likert scale","METHODS","death","admission","RESULTS","physiotherapist","rho","BACKGROUND","reintubate order","study"],"language":"en"},

We collected complete genome sequences from human samples in Saudi Arabia and data on the multiple risk factors of human MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia reported from 2012 to 2018. By matching each sequence to human cases, we identified isolates as hospital outbreak-associated cases or sporadic cases. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods including temporal, discrete trait analysis and phylogeography to uncover transmission routes of MERS-CoV isolates between hospital outbreaks and sporadic cases. Of the 120 sequences collected between 19 June 2012 and 23 January 2017, there were 64 isolates from hospital outbreak-associated cases and 56 from sporadic cases. Overall, MERS-CoV is fast evolving at 7.43 \u00D7 10-4 substitutions per site per year. Isolates from hospital outbreaks showed unusually fast evolutionary speed in a shorter time-frame than sporadic cases. Multiple introductions of different MERS-CoV strains occurred in three separate hospital outbreaks. MERS-CoV appears to be mutating in humans.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 were retrieved. Engagement data (Likes, Comments, Shares and Followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to further explore main content patterns while Chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study timeframe. RESULTS Public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier on Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situation, general knowledge of the new disease, and policies, guidelines and official actions. However, personal posts more likely showed empathy to affected people (chi-square=13.3, P\u003C.001), attributed blame to other individuals or government (chi-square=28.9, P\u003C.001), and expressed worry about the epidemic (chi-square=32.1, P\u003C.001) while government posts more likely shared instrumental support (chi-square=32.5, P\u003C.001) and praised people or organizations (chi-square=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation update (chi-square for trend=19.7, P\u003C.001), and policies, guidelines and official actions (chi-square for trend=15.3, P\u003C.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (chi-square for trend=25.3, P\u003C.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising and empathy in government posts (chi-square for trend=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation update and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.

Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an electrofluidic approach to controlled delivery into soft tissue models based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. This was achieved using a surgical suture, whereby transport of bioactive molecules, including drugs and proteins, was controlled by imposition of an electric field. Commonly employed surgical sutures or acrylic threads were integrated through the hydrogels to facilitate the directed introduction of bioactive species. The platform consisted of two reservoirs into which the ends of the thread were immersed. The anode and cathode were placed separately into each reservoir. The thread was taken from one reservoir to the other through the gel. When current was applied, biomolecules loaded onto the thread were directed into the gel. Under the same conditions, the rate of movement of the biomolecules along GelMA was dependent on the magnitude of the current. Using 5% GelMA and a current of 100 \u00B5A, 2 uL of fluorescein travelled through the hydrogel at a constant velocity of 7.17 \u00B1 0.50 um/s and took less than 8 minutes to exit on the thread. Small molecules such as riboflavin migrated faster (5.99 \u00B1 0.40 \u03BCm/s) than larger molecules such as dextran (2.26 \u00B1 0.55 \u03BCm/s with 4 kDa) or BSA (0.33 \u00B1 0.07 \u03BCm/s with 66.5 kDa). A number of commercial surgical sutures were tested and found to accommodate the controlled movement of biomolecules.

Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated. We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yueying; Roever, Leonardo; Tse, Gary; Liu, Tong","journal":"Current atherosclerosis reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11883-020-00842-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury","concurrent cardiac injury","infection","setting of SARS","cardiac function","myocardial injury","main clinical manifestation of SARS","ACE2","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","REVIEW Coronavirus disease","respiratory problems","new infectious disease","Wuhan","receptors","RECENT FINDINGS","host receptor","epicenter","pathways","key role","COVID","pneumonia","earliest reported cases","independent predictor","adverse outcomes","enzyme","cardiovascular complications","health professionals","PURPOSE","prevalence","routine care","outbreak","SARSCoV","angiotensin","pandemic status","issues"],"language":"en"},

However, given issues in accuracy with mammography, there is a need for evolving evidence-based surveillance recommendations with supplemental imaging. In this systematic review, we compiled and compared existing studies that describe the test performance of surveillance breast MRI among women with PHBC. METHODS We searched PubMed and EMBASE using MeSH terms for studies (2000-2019) that described the diagnostic characteristics of breast MRI in women with PHBC. Search results were reviewed and included based on PICOTS criteria; quality of included articles was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analysis of single proportions was conducted for diagnostic characteristics of breast MRI, including tests of heterogeneity. RESULTS Our review included 11 articles in which unique cohorts were studied, comprised of a total of 8338 women with PHBC and 12,335 breast MRI done for the purpose of surveillance. We predict intervals (PI) for cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations (PI 9-15; I2 = 10%), recall rate (PI 5-31%; I2 = 97%), sensitivity (PI 58-95%; I2 = 47%), specificity (PI 76-97%; I2 = 97%), and PPV3 (PI 16-40%; I2 = 44%). CONCLUSIONS Studies addressing performance of breast MRI are variable and limited in population-based studies. The summary of evidence to date is insufficient to recommend for or against use of breast MRI for surveillance among women with PHBC.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haas, Cameron B; Nekhlyudov, Larissa; Lee, Janie M; Javid, Sara H; Bush, Mary; Johnson, Dianne; Gleason, Timothy; Kaufman, Cary; Specht, Jennifer; Stitham, Sean; Wernli, Karen J","journal":"Breast cancer research and treatment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05637-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["performance of breast MRI","use of breast MRI","PHBC","I2","diagnostic characteristics of breast MRI","test performance of surveillance breast MRI","surveillance of breast cancer recurrence","purpose of surveillance","PURPOSE Women","personal history of breast cancer","population-based studies","existing studies","CONCLUSIONS Studies","evolving evidence-based surveillance recommendations","cancer detection rate","quality of included articles","summary of evidence","annual mammography","systematic review","Search results","EMBASE","need","supplemental imaging","new primary","PubMed","Meta-analysis of single proportions","MeSH terms","PICOTS criteria","examinations","tests of heterogeneity","date","intervals","unique cohorts","METHODS","issues","accuracy","QUADAS","total","sensitivity","specificity","PPV3"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection for recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis by performing specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision or Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision. METHODS A total of 269 patients operated between January 2014 and December 2017 were retrospectively screened for inclusion in the study. Patients with specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision (LLT) and patients with specimen extraction through Pfannenstiel-K incision (P-K) were matched in 1:1 proportion regarding age, sex, comorbidities, and previous abdominal surgery. The incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections were compared by using Fisher\u0027s exact test. RESULTS After matching 77 patients in the LLT group and 77 patients in the P-K group, they were found to be homogenous regarding the above mentioned descriptive characteristics. No patients in the P-K group developed an incisional hernia compared with 10 patients (13%) in the LLT group (p = 0.001). All these patients required hernia repair with mesh augmentation. The rate of surgical site infections was 1/77 in the P-K group and 0/77 in the LLT group (p = 1.0). In the P-K group, a wound protector was used in 86% of patients whereas in the LLT group, 39% of the wounds were protected during specimen extraction (p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSION The Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision may be the preferred extraction site compared with the left lower transverse incision given the significant reduction of the risk of incisional hernias.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varathan, N; Rotigliano, N; Nocera, F; Tampakis, A; F\u00FCglistaler, I; von Fl\u00FCe, M; Steinemann, D C; Posabella, A","journal":"International journal of colorectal disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-019-03444-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LLT","P-K"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","LLT group","left lower transverse incision","preferred extraction site","Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision","ideal location of specimen extraction","incidence of incisional hernias","rate of surgical site infections","risk of incisional hernias","study","colorectal surgery","hernia repair","elective laparoscopic resection","previous abdominal surgery","recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis","significant reduction","comorbidities","sex","mesh augmentation","OBJECTIVE","mentioned descriptive characteristics","proportion","age","Fisher\u0027s exact test","CONCLUSION","wounds","wound protector","METHODS","total","aim","inclusion","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study. NRS 2002 identified 85.8% of patients as having risk, with being identified 41.1% by MUST, 77.3% by MNA-sf, and 71.6% by NRI. The agreement strength was moderate between NRS 2002 and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MUST and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MNA-sf and NRI, poor between NRS 2002 and MUST (P \u003C 0.01). After adjustment for confounding factors in multivariate regression analysis, patients in the risk group had significantly longer LOS, higher hospital expenses (except MNA-sf), poor appetite, heavier disease severity, and more weight change(kg) than normal patients by using NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI(P \u003C 0.05).

A previous study demonstrated a high sensitivity of a phocid, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), in discriminating time intervals. In the present study, we compared the harbour seal\u0027s timing abilities with the timing abilities of an otariid, the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). This comparison seemed essential as phocids and otariids differ in many respects and might, thus, also differ regarding their timing abilities. We determined time difference thresholds for sub- and suprasecond time intervals marked by a white circle on a black background displayed for a specific time interval on a monitor using a staircase method. Contrary to our expectation, the timing abilities of the fur seal and the harbour seal were comparable. Over a broad range of time intervals, 0.8-7 s in the fur seal and 0.8-30 s in the harbour seal, the difference thresholds followed Weber\u0027s law. In this range, both animals could discriminate time intervals differing only by 12 % and 14 % on average. Timing might, thus be a fundamental cue for pinnipeds in general to be used in various contexts, thereby complementing information provided by classical sensory systems. Future studies will help to clarify if timing is indeed involved in foraging decisions or the estimation of travel speed or distance.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heinrich, Tamara; Ravignani, Andrea; Hanke, Frederike D","journal":"Animal cognition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-020-01390-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Weber"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harbour seal\u0027s timing abilities","suprasecond time intervals","discriminating time intervals","time difference thresholds","broad range of time intervals","South African fur seal","specific time interval","Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus","previous study","essential parameter","present study","Phoca vitulina","black background","white circle","information","monitor","estimation of travel speed","high sensitivity","foraging decisions","phocids","otariids","fundamental cue","Weber\u0027s law","classical sensory systems","pinnipeds","various contexts","distance","comparison","expectation","animals","staircase method","respects","behaviours","Future studies","average"],"language":"en"},

For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called \u0027Hungarian public health product tax\u0027 - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfinder, Manuela; Heise, Thomas L; Hilton Boon, Michele; Pega, Frank; Fenton, Candida; Griebler, Ursula; Gartlehner, Gerald; Sommer, Isolde; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Lhachimi, Stefan K","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012333.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cochrane Effective Practice"],"locations":["Denmark","Bermuda","Dominica","St. Vincent","Hungary"],"keyphrases":["added sugar","taxation of sugar","consumption of unprocessed sugar","controlled studies","records of included studies","unpublished studies","relevant studies","specific sugar threshold value","selected foods","foods high","diet-related health outcomes","food taxes","preventive public health","public health problem","defined intervention time","non-randomised controlled trials","cluster-randomised controlled trials","adverse health-related","review authors","obesity","incidence of overweight","eligible records","food products","deduplicating records","Hungarian public health product tax","taxation level","effects of taxation","trials registers","primary outcomes","secondary outcomes","BACKGROUND Global prevalence of overweight","data extraction","DATA COLLECTION","data points","bakery products","years","disease","countries","Hungarian Household Budget","household-level observations","fiscal policy interventions","contacted review advisory group members","social effects","specific subgroups","policy actions","co-interventions","SELECTION CRITERIA","Cochrane Effective Practice","interrupted time series","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","searched websites of international organisations","institutions","cRCTs","Organisation of Care","MEDLINE","ice cream","prices","artificial increases","Dominica","Bermuda","Hungary","confectionery","Embase","EPOC","substitution","expenditure","demand","sweets","SSBs","energy intake","general population","sweetened beverages","Grenadines","Denmark","Norway","databases","Conditions Survey","inclusion","risk of bias","certainty","children","people","title","ANALYSIS","study","turn","nRCTs","SEARCH METHODS","following populations","reference list","evidence","Navajo Nation","Vincent","USA","adults","total","abstract screening","price increase","salt","caffeine","side-effect","Exclusion","CBA","control site","GRADE approach","MAIN RESULTS","country","OBJECTIVES","baseline","follow-up","months","consumption of sugar","taxation of unprocessed sugar","mean consumption of taxed sugar","effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar","effect of taxing foods","primary outcomes of consumption","low risk of bias","adverse health outcomes","reporting bias","low-certainty evidence","detection bias","terms of performance bias","secondary outcomes of substitution","limited evidence","eligible studies","unclear risk of attrition bias","reported reduction","high risk","pool study results","shape of effect pre-specified","intervention unlikely","concrete conclusions","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","standardised mean difference","SMD","diet","meta-analyses","differential effects","implementation","population subgroups","confidence interval","independence","data collection","units"],"language":"en"},

As the intracellular NADH:NAD\u002B ratio can be in near equilibrium with the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, we hypothesized that reductive stress could be alleviated by oxidizing extracellular lactate to pyruvate. We engineered LOXCAT, a fusion of bacterial lactate oxidase (LOX) and catalase (CAT), which irreversibly converts lactate and oxygen to pyruvate and water. Addition of purified LOXCAT to the medium of cultured human cells with a defective electron transport chain decreased the extracellular lactate:pyruvate ratio, normalized the intracellular NADH:NAD\u002B ratio, upregulated glycolytic ATP production and restored cellular proliferation. In mice, tail-vein-injected LOXCAT lowered the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, blunted a metformin-induced rise in blood lactate:pyruvate ratio and improved NADH:NAD\u002B balance in the heart and brain.

METHOD All patients who underwent LDP or RDP from 2011 to 2017 and with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 12 months were included in the study. To minimize bias, a propensity score-matched analysis (1:2) was performed. Two different questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) were completed by the patients. The mean differential cost and mean differential Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) were calculated and plotted on a cost-utility plane. RESULTS The study population consisted of 152 patients. After having applied the propensity score matching, the final population included 103 patients divided into RDP group (n = 37, 36%) and LDP (n = 66, 64%). No differences were found between groups regarding the baseline, intraoperative, postoperative, and pathological variables (p \u003E 0.05). The QoL analysis showed a significant improvement in the RDP group on the postoperative social function, nausea, vomiting, and financial status (p = 0.010, p = 0.050, and p = 0.030, respectively). As expected, the crude costs analysis confirmed that RDP was more expensive than LDP (12,053 Euros vs. 5519 Euros, p \u003C 0.001). However, the robotic approach had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than the laparoscopic procedure when a willingness to pay of more than 4800 Euros/QALY was accepted. CONCLUSION RDP was associated with QoL improvement in specific domains. Crude costs were higher relative to LDP. Cost-effectiveness threshold resulted to be 4800 euros/QALY. The increasing worldwide diffusion of the robotic technology, with easier access and possible cost reduction, could increase the sustainability of this procedure.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Pastena, Matteo; Esposito, Alessandro; Paiella, Salvatore; Surci, Niccol\u00F2; Montagnini, Greta; Marchegiani, Giovanni; Malleo, Giuseppe; Secchettin, Erica; Casetti, Luca; Ricci, Claudio; Landoni, Luca; Bovo, Chiara; Bassi, Claudio; Salvia, Roberto","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07528-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDP","Quality Adjusted Life Years","RDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RDP group","LDP","patients","Euros","CONCLUSION RDP","QoL analysis","QALY","QoL improvement","study population","mean differential cost","crude costs analysis","Quality of Life","robotic technology","robotic approach","cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic","propensity score-matched analysis","laparoscopic procedure","possible cost reduction","postoperative social function","robotic distal pancreatectomy","propensity score matching","minimum postoperative follow-up","cost-utility plane","differential Quality Adjusted Life Years","significant improvement","higher probability","Cost-effectiveness threshold","final population","easier access","EORTC QLQ-C30","nausea","EQ","different questionnaires","increasing worldwide diffusion","months","pathological variables","financial status","groups","baseline","bias","sustainability","specific domains","willingness","BACKGROUND","METHOD","differences"],"language":"en"},

Bi, as a nontoxic and inexpensive diamagnetic heavy metal, has been used for the fabrication of various nanoparticles (NPs) with unique structural, physicochemical, and compositional features to combine various properties, such as a favourably high X-ray attenuation coefficient and near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, excellent light-to-heat conversion efficiency, and a long circulation half-life. These features have rendered bismuth-containing nanoparticles (BiNPs) with desirable performance for combined cancer therapy, photothermal and radiation therapy (RT), multimodal imaging, theranostics, drug delivery, biosensing, and tissue engineering. Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOx, where X is Cl, Br or I) and bismuth chalcogenides, including bismuth oxide, bismuth sulfide, bismuth selenide, and bismuth telluride, have been heavily investigated for therapeutic purposes. The pharmacokinetics of these BiNPs can be easily improved via the facile modification of their surfaces with biocompatible polymers and proteins, resulting in enhanced colloidal stability, extended blood circulation, and reduced toxicity. Desirable antibacterial effects, bone regeneration potential, and tumor growth suppression under NIR laser radiation are the main biomedical research areas involving BiNPs that have opened up a new paradigm for their future clinical translation. This review emphasizes the synthesis and state-of-the-art progress related to the biomedical applications of BiNPs with different structures, sizes, and compositions.

Firstly, these tools can be used in functional genomics to elucidate gene function, and identify causal variants underlying monogenic traits. Secondly, they can be used to precisely introduce useful genetic variation into structured livestock breeding programs. Such variation may include repair of genetic defects, the inactivation of undesired genes, and the moving of useful alleles and haplotypes between breeds in the absence of linkage drag. Editing could also be used to accelerate the rate of genetic progress by enabling the replacement of the germ cell lineage of commercial breeding animals with cells derived from genetically elite lines. In the future, editing may also provide a useful complement to evolving approaches to decrease the length of the generation interval through in vitro generation of gametes. For editing to be adopted, it will need to seamlessly integrate with livestock breeding schemes. This will likely involve introducing edits into multiple elite animals to avoid genetic bottlenecks. It will also require editing of different breeds and lines to maintain genetic diversity, and enable structured cross-breeding. This requirement is at odds with the process-based trigger and event-based regulatory approach that has been proposed for the products of genome editing by several countries. In the absence of regulatory harmony, researchers in some countries will have the ability to use genome editing in food animals, while others will not, resulting in disparate access to these tools, and ultimately the potential for global trade disruptions.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bishop, Thomas Frederick; Van Eenennaam, Alison Louise","journal":"The Journal of experimental biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.207159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prospect of genome editing","useful genetic variation","editing of different breeds","genetic diversity","genetic bottlenecks","livestock breeding schemes","structured livestock breeding programs","repair of genetic defects","structured cross-breeding","rate of genetic progress","multiple elite animals","food animals","livestock breeders","useful complement","elite lines","countries","products of genome","tools","germ cell lineage of commercial breeding animals","moving of useful alleles","absence of regulatory harmony","generation interval","regulatory approach","generation of gametes","absence of linkage","process-based trigger","number of promising opportunities","cells","causal variants","gene function","event","inactivation of undesired genes","replacement","haplotypes","potential","odds","functional genomics","researchers","global trade disruptions","monogenic traits","length","approaches","ability","edits","requirement","disparate access","future"],"language":"en"},

This epidemiological pattern has occurred numerous times during the last 70 years, including epidemics of dengue virus and West Nile virus, and the most recent explosive epidemic of Zika virus in the Americas. Flaviviruses are now globally distributed and infect up to 400 million people annually. Of significant concern, outbreaks of other less well-characterized flaviviruses have been reported in humans and animals in different regions of the world. The potential for these viruses to sustain epidemic transmission among humans is poorly understood. In this Review, we discuss the basic biology of flaviviruses, their infectious cycles, the diseases they cause and underlying host immune responses to infection.

We also provide examples of lesser-known flaviviruses that circulate in restricted areas of the world but have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations.

Data are from a cross-sectional sample of Latinx youth (N = 175; Mage = 12.86; 51.4% female; 86.9% US-born) who completed measures of foreigner-based objectification, peer discrimination, adult discrimination, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and the importance or value attributed to academic success. Evidence of significant indirect effects of skin color satisfaction in the links between foreigner-based objectification and self-esteem as well as academic importance was found. Skin color satisfaction did not mediate links between either peer or adult discrimination and self-esteem, depression, and academic importance. The results provide support that being perceived as a foreigner has negative implications for Latinx youth adjustment through skin color satisfaction.

The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has recently been suggested to influence HSC aging, however the mechanisms whereby BM stromal cells mediate this effect is unknown. Here we show that aging-associated decreased expression of CXCR4 expression on BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) aging phenotype. The BM MSC from old mice was sufficient to drive a premature aging phenotype of young HSPC when cultured together ex vivo. The impaired ability of old MSC to support HSPC function is associated with reduced expression of CXCR4 on BM MSC of old mice. Deletion of the CXCR4 gene in young MSC accelerates an aging phenotype in these cells characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, senescence, and reduced proliferation. Culture of HSPC from young mice with CXCR4 deficient MSC also from young mice led to a premature aging phenotype in the young HSPC, as evidenced by reduced hematopoietic regeneration and enhanced myeloid differentiation. Mechanistically, CXCR4 signaling prevents BM MSC dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stress, as treatment of old or CXCR4 deficient MSC with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), improved their niche supporting activity, and attenuated the HSPC aging phenotype. Our studies suggest that age-associated reduction in CXCR4 expression on BM MSC impairs hematopoietic niche activity with increased ROS production, driving an HSC aging phenotype. Thus, modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in MSC may lead to novel interventions to alleviate the age-associated decline in immune/hematopoietic function.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Pratibha; Kacena, Melissa A; Orschell, Christie M; Pelus, Louis M","journal":"Stem cell reviews and reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-09974-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BM","BM MSC","HSPC","MSC","SDF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young MSC","HSPC aging phenotype","CXCR4 deficient MSC","BM MSC of old mice","BM MSC dysfunction","HSC aging phenotype","premature aging phenotype of young HSPC","reduced expression of CXCR4","CXCR4 gene","CXCR4 axis","young mice","BM stromal cells","decreased expression of CXCR4 expression","BM mesenchymal stem cells","impaired ability of old MSC","HSPC function","hematopoietic function","Culture of HSPC","progenitor cells","regenerative potential of hematopoietic stem cells","hematopoietic niche activity","hematopoietic regeneration","treatment of old","age-associated reduction","age-associated decline","increased ROS production","myeloid differentiation","reduced proliferation","skews differentiation","myeloid lineage","increased production of reactive oxygen species","DNA damage","oxidative stress","N-acetyl","senescence","development","mechanisms","effect","novel interventions","crucial role","cysteine","NAC","bone marrow","microenvironment","SDF","studies","Deletion","modulation"],"language":"en"},

TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure.Methods: In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG, and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and it\u0027s expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT, and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV, and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs.Results: Out of 11184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing, and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile.Conclusion: This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations. Also, this study could pave the way to potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2 in designing antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paniri, Alireza; Hosseini, Mohammad Mahdi; Akhavan-Niaki, Haleh","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1767690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Objective","HSF","GOR IV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMPRSS2 function","role of TMPRSS2 SNPs","secondary structure of TMPRSS2","impact of SNPs","retrieved SNPs","Current SARS-CoV","different populations","study","potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2","SARS-CoV2 entry","functional effects of SNPs","miRNA function","different frequency","PTM","cell entry","appearance of different susceptibility","crucial role","expression profile","protein folding","miRNA profiles","novo pocket protein","wide spectrum of miRNAs profile","non-coding RNAs","epigenetic mechanisms","Conclusion","donor site","secretory properties","Gtex","silencer","silico tools","way","pandemy mortality","Methods","broken enhancer motifs","transmembrane serine protease","PSIPRED","GEPIA","ExPASY","Ensembl","PolymiRTS","Results","dbSNP","Objective","Single nucleotide polymorphisms","translational modification","antiviral drugs","Phyre2","GOR IV","CCLE","miRSNPs","Modpredand Phobius","rs12627374","hypothesis","Background","PolyPhen","Asians","SNAP2","rs12329760","KEGG","rs875393","HSF"],"language":"en"},

The teachers\u0027 abilities to develop gerontological nursing course most influence students\u0027 willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.26, p = 0.001), whereas their knowledge and interest in gerontology, least influenced students\u0027 willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.14, p = 0.025). Also, the teachers abilities to address students\u0027 concerns about aging, promote gerontology careers, and demonstrate leadership skills in gerontology all had a similar statistically significant moderate positive association (r = 0.23, p = 0.001) with students\u0027 willingness to work in older people nursing. CONCLUSION Faculty need to ensure that there is adequate personal with expertise in gerontological nursing to advocate for resources to establish a reputable gerontological nursing profile in nursing curriculum and to develop and sustain a positive attitude towards older people nursing among students and staff. A qualitative study is needed to understand the reasons behind students\u0027 ratings.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garbrah, William; Kankkunen, P\u00E4ivi; V\u00E4lim\u00E4ki, Tarja","journal":"Nurse education today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Applied Sciences","Gerontological Nurse Teacher Scale"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nursing students\u0027","Nursing Older People Scale","students\u0027 perspectives","nursing curriculum","students\u0027 concerns","students\u0027 ratings","gerontological nursing course","influence students\u0027 willingness","influenced students\u0027 willingness","reputable gerontological nursing profile","students\u0027 career preference","PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate nursing students","gerontological nurse teachers\u0027 abilities","Gerontological Nurse Teacher Scale","gerontology careers","teachers abilities","significant moderate positive association","positive attitude","qualitative study","cross-sectional correlation study","GeNTS","self-administered survey","aging","resources","leadership skills","expertise","subscale","factors","SINOPS","inferential analysis","Universities of Applied Sciences","Finland","METHOD","RESULTS","reasons","OBJECTIVE","staff","interventions","BACKGROUND Previous studies","SPSS","role","CONCLUSION Faculty","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Virome studies in bats distributed in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America have increased dramatically over the past decade, whereas information on viruses infecting South American species is scarce. We explored the virome of Tadarida brasiliensis, an insectivorous New World bat species inhabiting a maternity colony in Rosario (Argentina), by a metagenomic approach. The analysis of five pooled oral/anal swab samples indicated the presence of 43 different taxonomic viral families infecting a wide range of hosts. By conventional nucleic acid detection techniques and/or bioinformatics approaches, the genomes of two novel viruses were completely covered clustering into the Papillomaviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis papillomavirus type 1, TbraPV1) and Genomoviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis gemykibivirus 1, TbGkyV1) families. TbraPV1 is the first papillomavirus type identified in this host and the prototype of a novel genus. TbGkyV1 is the first genomovirus reported in New World bats and constitutes a new species within the genus Gemykibivirus.

While healthcare systems need to cope with the need to treat a large number of people with different degrees of respiratory failure, actions to preserve aliquots of the healthcare system to guarantee treatment to patients are mandatory. METHODS In order to protect the Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano from the spread of COVID-19, a number of to-hospital and within-hospital filters were applied. Among others, a triage process to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in patients with cancer was developed consisting of high-resolution low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nose-throat swabs whenever CT was suggestive of lung infection. To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up. RESULTS A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020. Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery. RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%).

Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in Essential Tremor (ET). METHODS In experiment 1, we compared nineteen participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ETDBS ) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse-at-target goal-directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants (ET) with 10 HC to determine if we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non-DBS ET. RESULTS Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independent of tremor in ET. First, ETDBS and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (R2 \u003C0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor-free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (p\u003C0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (p\u003C0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (p\u003E0.2). INTERPRETATION We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independent of tremor using fast, reverse at target goal-directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders.

People experiencing disability due to Covid-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. OBJECTIVES To provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19. The first rapid \u0022living\u0022 review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. METHODS A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: \u0022Covid-19\u0022, \u0022Coronavirus\u0022, \u0022severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u0022, \u0022rehabilitation\u0022, \u0022physical therapy modalities\u0022, \u0022exercise\u0022, \u0022occupational therapy\u0022, and \u0022late complications\u0022. Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review. Four of them are \u0022calls for action\u0022, 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ceravolo, Maria G; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Negrini, Stefano","journal":"European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.20.06329-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pedro"],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current Covid","outbreak of Covid","needs of people","rehabilitation community","early rehabilitation","rehabilitation interventions","systematic search","disabled people","express specific rehabilitation","national health systems","efficacy of health strategies","provision of health care","lockdown","restricted mobility","search terms","updates","home","needs of frail subjects","results","present review","systematic evidence-based approach","exercise programs","previous literature","acute phase","main flaws","occupational therapy","Main messages","emerging disability","selected papers","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","latest scientific literature","physical therapy modalities","PubMed","quarantine","cognitive decline","sarcopenia","risk of frailty","Google Scholar","Pedro","survivors","depression","respect","adverse effects","recommendations","capacity","epidemics","telerehabilitation","clinical trials","order","option","METHODS","inpatients","late complications","Core Outcome","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","pandemic","action","English","articles"],"language":"en"},

Current clinical guidelines rely mainly on histopathological markers with relatively weak prognostic value. This motivates further search for prognostic markers. METHODS This explorative study aimed to identify potential candidate gene mutations to facilitate differentiation between subgroups of patients with CRC stage II. Panel-based massive parallel sequencing was used to genetically characterize tumor tissues from 85 patients radically operated for CRC stage II, of which 12 developed recurrent cancer during follow-up. Genetic data was compared between patients with or without cancer recurrence, between tumors located in colon and in rectum, and for association with tumor differentiation grade. RESULTS Genetic variation in ATM, C11ORF65 was associated with recurrence-free survival. Previous reports regarding the association between BRAF mutation and a higher age at diagnosis, and tumor location in colon were confirmed. APC, BRAF, or KRAS mutation was associated with tumor differentiation grade. Multiple correspondence analyses revealed no obvious clustering of patients with the studied clinical characteristics, indicating that the genetic signatures observed here were unique for each individual. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, we have demonstrated the utility of panel-based massive parallel sequencing to explore the pathogenesis of CRC stage II. We have identified promising candidate gene mutations associated with cancer recurrence, tumor location, and differentiation grade in patients with CRC stage II, which merit further investigation.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimberg, Jan; Andersson, Roland E; Haglund, Sofie","journal":"Oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRC","APC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tumor differentiation grade","pathogenesis of CRC stage","subgroups of patients","cancer recurrence","tumor location","tumor tissues","obvious clustering of patients","colorectal cancer","recurrent cancer","potential candidate gene mutations","BRAF mutation","association","massive parallel sequencing","BACKGROUND Identification of high-risk stage","prognostic markers","genetic signatures","Genetic data","colon","promising candidate gene mutations","recurrence-free survival","RESULTS Genetic variation","KRAS mutation","potential candidates","histopathological markers","utility of panel","studied clinical characteristics","Current clinical guidelines","weak prognostic value","C11ORF65","diagnosis","higher age","ATM","explorative study","Multiple correspondence analyses","adjuvant chemotherapy","rectum","tumors","Previous reports","APC","METHODS","follow-up","search","individual","investigation","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Using both the disk diffusion test and checkerboard assay, we initially examined the effects of combinations of retapamulin with MLS antibiotics against standard strains of these species. Combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and quinupristin showed synergistic activity against E. faecalis only. Synergy of retapamulin with clindamycin and dalfopristin was not observed. Then, a checkerboard assay was performed to evaluate the effects of the combinations against 15 clinical strains of E. faecalis. Retapamulin and quinupristin, the most synergistic combination, showed activity against all erythromycin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains tested. Among the eight strains with high-level erythromycin resistance, five strains were synergistically inhibited in the presence of only 1 \u03BCg of retapamulin per ml. Time-kill assay revealed that combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin and quinupristin were bacteriostatic.

Workflow considerations included the progressive introduction of outpatient COVID-19 testing in the ED for enhanced surveillance; adapting the admissions process particularly for high-risk and intermediate-risk cases; and the management of unwell accompanying adult caregivers. Manpower considerations included the reorganisation of medical manpower into modular teams to mitigate the risk of hospital transmission of COVID-19. Future plans for a tiered isolation facility should include structural modifications for the permanent isolation facility such as anterooms for PPE donning/doffing; replication of key ED functions in the tent facility such as a separate resuscitation room and portable X-ray room; and refresher PPE training.

From the identified antigenic protein, the peptide region ranging from 186 to 220 and the sequence HKEGAFFLY from the positions of 154\u2013162 were considered the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, correspondingly. Moreover, this peptide (HKEGAFFLY) interacted with HLA-A*32:15 with the highest binding energy and stability, and also a good conservancy of 83.85% with maximum population coverage. The results imply that the designed epitopes could manifest vigorous enduring defensive immunity against EBOV.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dash, Raju; Das, Rasel; Junaid, Md; Akash, Md Forhad Chowdhury; Islam, Ashekul; Hosen, SM Zahid","journal":"Adv Appl Bioinform Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fea94793ba395cf36728e4e3cc33a3df0097cd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5367765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycoproteins of EBOV","T-cell epitopes","potential B-cell","avoidance of EBOV infections","T-cell epitope predictions","molecular docking","epitope-based peptide vaccine","peptide region","immunogenic protein","protein sequences","available molecular knowledge","identified antigenic protein","molecular dynamics simulation approach","designed epitopes","definite vaccine","combination of B","Ebola virus","sequence HKEGAFFLY","vigorous enduring defensive immunity","stability","good conservancy","present study","maximum population coverage","highest binding energy","remedial agents","management","humans","epidemic outbreaks","silico methods","date","positions","lethal viruses","results","HLA"],"language":"en"},

The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNA(Lys) and the slippery codons from the A- and P- sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options.

This study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing UPR and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein. By transient expression, we found that both replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins of PCV2 could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2\u03B1-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4)-CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) axis. Cap expression, but not Rep, significantly reduced antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased caspase-3 cleavage, possibly due to increased expression of CHOP. Since knockdown of PERK by RNA interference clearly reduced Cap-induced CHOP expression, caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing Bcl-2 expression, we propose that there is connection between Cap-induced UPR and apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2\u03B1/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway.

In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA viruses. METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(\u002B) plasmid, generating pET47b(\u002B)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(\u002B)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2017-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zambenedetti, Miriam Ribas; Pavoni, Daniela Parada; Dallabona, Andreia Cristine; Dominguez, Alejandro Correa; Poersch, Celina de Oliveira; Fragoso, Stenio Perdig\u00E3o; Krieger, Marco Aur\u00E9lio","journal":"Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0acc757154434d8afc870e55c010962a61cc0af3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5398160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5398160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IC","HCV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["MS2 genome","MS2 bacteriophage","utility of MS2","RNA virus diagnosis","synthesis of MS2 RNA genome","RNA virus diagnostics","construction of virus","HCV detection","HCV diagnosis","non-competitive IC","MS2 replicase gene of pET47b","diagnosis of RNA viruses","useful IC","non-propagating MS2 particle","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","T7 RNA polymerase","different RNA viruses","modified particles","human immunodeficiency virus","HCV amplification performance","mutated HCV sequence","real-time RT-PCR","detection steps","detection of samples","competitive control","use of nucleic acid tests","Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","internal control","low target concentrations","low cost protocol","blood banks","extraction","consequent","BACKGROUND","one-step format","assays","true negative results","failure","applicability","study","immunological window","insertion of sequences","system","multicontrol","aim","addition","strategy","advantage","attractive feature","pathogen","OBJECTIVES","Brazil","plasmid","METHODS","conclusion","viral infections","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km(2). RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of household-specific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 \u00D7 10 (\u2212) (3) (95% highest posterior density: 0.935\u20134.165\u00D7 10 (\u2212) (3)) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.","publish_time":"2017-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agoti, Charles N.; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Phan, My V.

Severe cases such as, hyperinfection syndrome (HS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis (DS), can involve pulmonary manifestations. These manifestations frequently aid the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Here, we present the pulmonary manifestations and radiological findings of severe strongyloidiasis. METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2014, all patients diagnosed with severe strongyloidiasis at the University of the Ryukyus Hospital or affiliated hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, were included in this retrospective study. All diagnoses were confirmed by the microscopic or histopathological identification of larvae. Severe strongyloidiasis was defined by the presence of any of the following: 1) the identification of S. stercoralis from extra gastrointestinal specimens, 2) sepsis, 3) meningitis, 4) acute respiratory failure, or 5) respiratory tract hemorrhage. Patients were assigned to either HS or DS. Medical records were further reviewed to extract related clinical features and radiological findings. RESULTS: Sixteen severe strongyloidiasis cases were included. Of those, fifteen cases had pulmonary manifestations, eight had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (53%), seven had enteric bacterial pneumonia (46%) and five had pulmonary hemorrhage (33%). Acute respiratory failure was a common indicator for pulmonary manifestation (87%). Chest X-ray findings frequently showed diffuse shadows (71%). Additionally, ileum gas was detected for ten of the sixteen cases in the upper abdomen during assessment with chest X-ray. While, chest CT findings frequently showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 89% of patients. Interlobular septal thickening was also frequently shown (67%), always accompanying GGO in upper lobes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study described HS/DS cases with pulmonary manifestations including, ARDS, bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage. Chest X-ray findings in HS/DS cases frequently showed diffuse shadows, and the combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening in chest CT was common in HS/DS, regardless of accompanying pulmonary manifestations. This CT finding suggests alveolar hemorrhage could be used as a potential marker indicating the transition from latent to symptomatic state. Respiratory specimens are especially useful for detecting larvae in cases of HS/DS.","publish_time":"2017-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nabeya, Daijiro; Haranaga, Shusaku; Parrott, Gretchen Lynn; Kinjo, Takeshi; Nahar, Saifun; Tanaka, Teruhisa; Hirata, Tetsuo; Hokama, Akira; Tateyama, Masao; Fujita, Jiro","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93c18ef4d3e170ccc5233a1f407ed63b58baf491.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5414214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","HS/DS","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary manifestations","cases of HS","DS cases","severe strongyloidiasis cases","Severe cases","pulmonary hemorrhage","radiological findings of severe strongyloidiasis","chest CT findings","Chest X-ray findings","diagnosis of strongyloidiasis","Respiratory specimens","acute respiratory failure","respiratory tract hemorrhage","patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","alveolar hemorrhage","ARDS","combination of GGO","diffuse shadows","Interlobular septal thickening","histopathological identification of larvae","enteric bacterial pneumonia","common indicator","hyperinfection syndrome","Strongyloides stercoralis","upper abdomen","upper lobes","retrospective study","extra gastrointestinal specimens","chronic parasitic infection","affiliated hospitals","Ryukyus Hospital","transition","Okinawa","University","ground-glass opacity","assessment","related clinical features","Japan","sepsis","meningitis","potential marker","symptomatic state","BACKGROUND","summary","presence","RESULTS","following","CONCLUSIONS","Medical records","ileum gas","diagnoses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

To assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development, we performed a proteomics analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) in leg muscle tissues of female Xinghua chicken at embryonic age (E) 11, E16, and 1-day post hatch (D1). We identified 3,240 proteins in chicken embryonic muscle and 491 of them were differentially expressed (fold change \u2265 1.5 or \u2264 0.666 and p \u003C 0.05). There were 19 up- and 32 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. E16 group, 238 up- and 227 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. D1 group, and 13 up- and 5 down-regulated proteins in E16 vs. D1 group. Protein interaction network analyses indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathway of protein synthesis, muscle contraction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Integrative analysis of proteome and our previous transcriptome data found 189 differentially expressed proteins that correlated with their mRNA level. The interactions between these proteins were also involved in muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The lncRNA-protein interaction network found four proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 that are all involved in muscle contraction and may be lncRNA regulated. These results provide several candidate genes for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of chicken embryonic muscle development, and enable us to better understanding their regulation networks and biochemical pathways.","publish_time":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ouyang, Hongjia; Wang, Zhijun; Chen, Xiaolan; Yu, Jiao; Li, Zhenhui; Nie, Qinghua","journal":"Front Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93507716d80b9834a1ee584b038c1be54c0790a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5420592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5420592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["muscle contraction","regulated proteins","embryonic skeletal muscle development","development of skeletal muscle","proteins DMD","molecular mechanisms of chicken embryonic muscle development","major determinant of muscle mass","embryonic age","Embryonic growth","E16 group","D1 group","leg muscle tissues of female Xinghua chicken","lncRNA-protein interaction network","Protein interaction network analyses","protein expression profiles","pathway of protein synthesis","E11","oxidative phosphorylation pathways","proteomics analysis","biochemical pathways","Integrative analysis of proteome","absolute quantification","isobaric tags","iTRAQ","significant effect","investigation","MYL3","previous transcriptome data","meat production","TNNI2","day post hatch","candidate genes","regulation networks","TNNT3","results","mRNA level","fold change","interactions"],"language":"en"},

Examination of the trachea transcriptome showed a large increase in immune cell infiltration in the trachea in both lines at all times postinfection. The pathways conserved across lines and at all three time points postinfection included iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-\u03BAB signaling, the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. Although shared pathways were seen in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, each line showed unique responses as well. The downregulation of collagen and the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at 2 days postinfection may contribute to the resistance phenotype seen in the Fayoumis.

DI-RNAs emerge during virus passaging in both cell-culture and their hosts as a result of non-homologous RNA recombination. However, the principles of DI-RNA emergence and their subsequent evolution have remained elusive. Using a combination of long- and short-read Next-Generation Sequencing, we have characterized the formation of DI-RNAs during serial passaging of Flock House virus (FHV) in cell-culture over a period of 30 days in order to elucidate the pathways and potential mechanisms of DI-RNA emergence and evolution. For short-read RNAseq, we employed \u2018ClickSeq\u2019 due to its ability to sensitively and confidently detect RNA recombination events with nucleotide resolution. In parallel, we used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies\u2019s (ONT) MinION to resolve full-length defective and wild-type viral genomes. Together, these accurately resolve both rare and common RNA recombination events, determine the correlation between recombination events, and quantifies the relative abundance of different DI-RNAs throughout passaging. We observe the formation of a diverse pool of defective RNAs at each stage of viral passaging. However, many of these \u2018intermediate\u2019 species, while present in early stages of passaging, do not accumulate. After approximately 9 days of passaging we observe the rapid accumulation of DI-RNAs with a correlated reduction in specific infectivity and with the Nanopore data find that DI-RNAs are characterized by multiple RNA recombination events. This suggests that intermediate DI-RNA species are not competitive and that multiple recombination events interact epistatically to confer \u2018mature\u2019 DI-RNAs with their selective advantage allowing for their rapid accumulation. Alternatively, it is possible that mature DI-RNA species are generated in a single event involving multiple RNA rearrangements. These insights have important consequences for our understanding of the mechanisms, determinants and limitations in the emergence and evolution of DI-RNAs.","publish_time":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaworski, Elizabeth; Routh, Andrew","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e69a0c654041707c6ffefca96f14c2f1fe05296c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Nanopore","Oxford Nanopore Technologies\u2019s"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of DI","formation of DI","mature DI-RNA species","intermediate DI-RNA species","principles of DI","RNA emergence","multiple RNA recombination events","rapid accumulation of DI","common RNA recombination events","relative abundance of different DI-RNAs","potential mechanisms of DI","Defective-Interfering RNAs","multiple recombination events","multiple RNA rearrangements","diverse pool of defective RNAs","result of non-homologous RNA recombination","stage of viral passaging","early stages of passaging","serial passaging of Flock House virus","virus replication","cell-culture","subsequent evolution","days","Nanopore data","important consequences","important role","Oxford Nanopore Technologies\u2019s","wild-type viral genomes","MinION","ONT","FHV","specific infectivity","single event","understanding","hosts","pathways","correlated reduction","selective advantage","correlation","order","transmission","determinants","period","limitations","nucleotide resolution","insights","Generation Sequencing","ClickSeq","RNAseq","ability"],"language":"en"},

The effect of such isoforms on pulmonary vascular permeability is unknown. We hypothesised that VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b isoforms would have differing effects on pulmonary vascular permeability caused by differential activation of intercellular signal transduction pathways. METHOD: To test this hypothesis we investigated the physiological effect of VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b on Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (HPMEC) permeability using three different methods: trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and FITC-BSA passage. In addition, potential downstream signalling pathways of the VEGF isoforms were investigated by Western blotting and the use of specific signalling inhibitors. RESULTS: VEGF(165)a increased HPMEC permeability using all three methods (paracellular and transcellular) and led to associated VE-cadherin and actin stress fibre changes. In contrast, VEGF(165)b decreased paracellular permeability and did not induce changes in VE-cadherin cell distribution. Furthermore, VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b had differing effects on both the phosphorylation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling proteins pMEK, p42/44MAPK, p38 MAPK, pAKT and peNOS. Interestingly specific inhibition of the pMEK, p38 MAPK, PI3 kinase and eNOS pathways blocked the effects of both VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b on paracellular permeability and the effect of VEGF(165)a on proliferation/migration, suggesting that this difference in cellular response is mediated by an as yet unidentified signalling pathway(s). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the novel isoform VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b induce differing effects on permeability in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ourradi, Khadija; Blythe, Thomas; Jarrett, Caroline; Barratt, Shaney L.; Welsh, Gavin I.; Millar, Ann B.","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b6a333c49c59ef249831dc4c062aee5a9d7683.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5457598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5457598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VEGF isoforms","physiological effect of VEGF","phosphorylation of VEGF receptors","novel isoform VEGF","paracellular permeability","b isoforms","pulmonary vascular permeability","differing isoforms","differing effects","increased HPMEC permeability","Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell","pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells","p38 MAPK","potential downstream signalling pathways","downstream signalling proteins pMEK","eNOS pathways","VE-cadherin cell distribution","use of specific signalling inhibitors","unidentified signalling pathway","Alternative splicing of Vascular endothelial growth factor","trans-endothelial electrical resistance","associated VE-cadherin","different methods","specific inhibition","Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing","differential activation of intercellular signal transduction pathways","significant physiological outcomes","actin stress fibre changes","conditions","ECIS","TEER","p42","PI3 kinase","acute respiratory distress syndrome","mRNA transcripts","Western blotting","relative amounts","ARDS","study","BACKGROUND","pAKT","addition","FITC-BSA passage","difference","hypothesis","peNOS","generation","cellular response","migration","proliferation","contrast","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin.

The objective of this analysis was to measure the cost of an NiV prevention intervention and estimate the cost of scaling it up to districts where spillover had been identified. METHODS: We implemented a behavior change communication intervention in two districts, testing different approaches to reduce the risk of NiV transmission using community mobilization, interpersonal communication, posters and TV public service announcements on local television during the 2012\u20132014 sap harvesting seasons. In one district, we implemented a \u201Cno raw sap\u201D approach recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap. In another district, we implemented an \u201Conly safe sap\u201D approach, recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap but offering the option of drinking safe sap. This is sap covered with a barrier, locally called bana, to interrupt bats\u2019 access during collection. We conducted surveys among randomly selected respondents two months after the intervention to measure the proportion of people reached. We used an activity-based costing method to calculate the cost of the intervention. RESULTS: The implementation cost of the \u201Cno raw sap\u201D intervention was $30,000 and the \u201Conly safe sap\u201D intervention was $55,000. The highest cost was conducting meetings and interpersonal communication efforts. The lowest cost was broadcasting the public service announcements on local TV channels. To scale up a similar intervention in 30 districts where NiV spillover has occurred, would cost between $2.6 and $3.5 million for one season. Placing the posters would cost $96,000 and only broadcasting the public service announcement through local channels in 30 districts would cost $26,000. CONCLUSIONS: Broadcasting a TV public service announcement is a potential low cost option to advance NiV prevention. It could be supplemented with posters and targeted interpersonal communication, in districts with a high risk of NiV spillover.

In this study, we analyzed six chitin-binding lectins, DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA, by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. Some novel features were evident: WGA showed almost comparable affinity for pyridylaminated chitotriose and chitotetraose, while LEL and UDA showed much weaker affinity, and DSA, PWM, and STL had no substantial affinity for the former. WGA showed selective affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans harboring a bisecting GlcNAc residue. UDA showed extensive binding to high-mannose type N-glycans, with affinity increasing with the number of Man residues. DSA showed the highest affinity for highly branched N-glycans consisting of type II LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Further, multivalent features of these lectins were investigated by using glycoconjugate and lectin microarrays. The lectins showed substantial binding to immobilized LacNAc as well as chito-oligosaccharides, although the extents to which they bound varied among them. WGA showed strong binding to heavily sialylated glycoproteins. The above observations will help interpret lectin-glycoprotein interactions in histochemical studies and glyco-biomarker investigations.","publish_time":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Itakura, Yoko; Nakamura-Tsuruta, Sachiko; Kominami, Junko; Tateno, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Jun","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3345fa1a77d9ad2f4bce48138490e60a462fe18b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5485984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSA","STL","LEL","WGA","UDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["substantial affinity","comparable affinity","weaker affinity","selective affinity","WGA","highest affinity","Chitin-binding lectins","substantial binding","extensive binding","strong binding","binding domains","hybrid-type N-glycans","N-acetylglucosamine","branched N-glycans","N-acetyllactosamine","UDA","DSA","high-mannose type N-glycans","quantitative frontal affinity chromatography","LEL","PWM","STL","chito-oligosaccharides","conserved GlcNAc","immobilized LacNAc","lectin microarrays","novel features","multivalent features","lectin-glycoprotein interactions","bisecting GlcNAc residue","histochemical studies","chitotetraose","pyridylaminated chitotriose","glyco-biomarker investigations","hevein family","presence of single","sialylated glycoproteins","plants","detailed specificities","glycoconjugate","number of Man residues","observations","probes","extents","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84% included mammals. Further, 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2017-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plourde, Benjamin T.; Burgess, Tristan L.; Eskew, Evan A.; Roth, Tara M.; Stephenson, Nicole; Foley, Janet E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40cdf2909c24827365de82a6a5d84a7c3aec0290.json; document_parses/pdf_json/62067c9aa24d6b8cbd2a02101c4d4e34681fab97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5509157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5509157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Reservoir species","mammals","identified reservoir hosts","reservoirs of spillover pathogens","community of reservoir hosts","single species","life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts","characteristics of animal reservoirs","orders of mammalian species","quarters of reservoirs","disease systems","high priority pathogens","pathogen spillover","faster life history characteristics","pathogen spills","animal health burden","epidemic potential","greater reproductive output","significant human","rodents","artiodactyls","useful resource","primates","long-term survival","birds","bats","emerging infectious diseases","described patterns","distribution","wildlife","respects","carnivores","database","persistence","chance"],"language":"en"},

The axon initial segment (AIS) is thought to play a role in the selective localization of tau in the axonal compartment. Thus, disruption in the AIS barrier may allow tau to diffuse freely back into the somatodendritic compartment and potentially lead to neurotoxicity. Here, we analyzed AISs using stereological methods and protein immunoblotting, and the localization of tau was assessed with immunofluorescence optical density measurements and protein immunoblotting. None of the outcome measurements assessed, including AIS structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the hippocampus (HP), and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were different in young, middle-, and old-age Fischer 344 rats.

Here we found that sodium arsenite (SA) and HS, but not hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), induce SG formation in human induced (hi) PSCs. Particularly, we found that these granules contain the well-known SG proteins (G3BP, TIAR, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3B, eIF4G, and PABP), were found in juxtaposition to processing bodies (PBs), and were disassembled after the removal of the stress. Moreover, we showed that SA and HS, but not H(2)O(2), promote eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation in hiPSCs forming SGs. Analysis of pluripotent protein expression showed that HS significantly reduced all tested markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, L1TD1, and LIN28A), while SA selectively reduced the expression levels of NANOG and L1TD1. Finally, in addition to LIN28A and L1TD1, we identified DPPA5 (pluripotent protein marker) as a novel component of SGs.

These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds.

The live attenuated vaccine strain, YFV-17D, has significantly contributed in controlling the global burden of yellow fever worldwide. However, the viral and host contributions to YFV-17D attenuation remain elusive. Type I interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) signaling and type II interferon (IFN-\u03B3) signaling have been shown to be mutually supportive in controlling YFV-17D infection despite distinct mechanisms of action in viral infection. However, it remains unclear how type III IFN (IFN-\u03BB) integrates into this antiviral system. Here, we report that while wild-type (WT) and IFN-\u03BB receptor knockout (\u03BBR(\u2212/\u2212)) mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D, deficiency in type I IFN signaling resulted in robust infection. Although IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor knockout (\u03B1/\u03B2R(\u2212/\u2212)) mice survived the infection, mice with combined deficiencies in both type I signaling and type III IFN signaling were hypersusceptible to YFV-17D and succumbed to the infection. Mortality was associated with viral neuroinvasion and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). \u03B1/\u03B2R(\u2212/\u2212) \u03BBR(\u2212/\u2212) mice also exhibited distinct changes in the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages, impaired T-cell activation, and severe perturbation of the proinflammatory cytokine balance. Taken together, our data highlight that type III IFN has critical immunomodulatory and neuroprotective functions that prevent viral neuroinvasion during active YFV-17D replication. Type III IFN thus likely represents a safeguard mechanism crucial for controlling YFV-17D infection and contributing to shaping vaccine immunogenicity.","publish_time":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Douam, Florian; Soto Albrecht, Yentli E.; Hrebikova, Gabriela; Sadimin, Evita; Davidson, Christian; Kotenko, Sergei V.; Ploss, Alexander","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/959b3431d24276e1b5d1bcfa7885979a4310bd98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5559630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5559630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III IFN"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","D infection","IFN-\u03B3","viral infection","wild-type","active YFV","IFN-\u03BB receptor knockout","D attenuation","D replication","mice","robust infection","viral neuroinvasion","\u03B2 receptor knockout","interferon","\u03B2R","\u03BBR","Yellow fever virus","distinct changes","vaccine immunogenicity","global burden of yellow fever","distinct mechanisms of action","impaired T-cell activation","live attenuated vaccine strain","frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages","severe perturbation","neuroprotective functions","increased permeability","blood-brain barrier","safeguard mechanism crucial","WT","host contributions","proinflammatory cytokine balance","arthropod","combined deficiencies","deficiency","flavivirus","infecting","BBB","people","antiviral system","Mortality","data","deaths"],"language":"en"},

This results in lung tissue inflammation, capillary leakage, interstitial and alveolar oedema and lung injury reducing the production of surfactant by the damaged AT II cells and deactivating the surfactant function by the concomitant extravasated serum proteins through capillary leakage followed by a substantial increase in alveolar surface tension and alveolar collapse. The resulting inhomogeneous ventilation of the lungs is an important mechanism in the development of ventilation-induced lung injury. The high levels of extracellular ATP and the upregulation of ecto-enzymes and soluble enzymes that hydrolyse ATP to adenosine (CD39 and CD73) increase the extracellular adenosine levels that inhibit the innate and adaptive immune responses rendering the host susceptible to infection by invading microorganisms. Moreover, high levels of extracellular adenosine increase the expression, the production and the activation of pro-fibrotic proteins (such as TGF-\u03B2, \u03B1-SMA, etc.) followed by the establishment of lung fibrosis.

METHODS: A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang Databases. The search restrictions were patients with UC and RCTs. Studies including other treatments except Kangfuxinye with mesalamine were excluded. RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. We found significant benefits of Kangfuxinye combined with mesalamine against mesalamine alone in improving response rate as well as reducing the recurrence rate and inflammation rate; meanwhile, the increase of the adverse events rate was not observed. Furthermore, the symptoms remission rate and the cure time were insignificant statistically. Additionally, GRADE results indicated that the quality of evidence regarding the above 6 outcomes was rated from very low to moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although Kangfuxinye enema seems effective and safe for treating UC patients in this systematic review, Kangfuxinye enema combined with mesalamine was weakly recommended due to very low to moderate quality of available evidence by the GRADE approach.","publish_time":"2017-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Peng-wei; Yang, Wen-jie; Wang, Dan-dan; Shan, Jing-yan; Kang, De-ying; Hong, Qi; Wen, Shu; Zhang, Ru-wen","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c60b9bd1c5edac3f1f4916571a10a6daf9b569a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5564127.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5564127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WanFang Databases","UC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mesalamine","quality of evidence","UC patients","safety of Kangfuxinye enema","inflammation rate","recurrence rate","response rate","GRADE approach","GRADE results","moderate quality of available evidence","significant benefits of Kangfuxinye","symptoms remission rate","adverse events rate","Studies","search restrictions","literature search","CNKI","EMBASE","systematic review","VIP","CBM","MEDLINE","development","Cochrane Library","assessment","cure time","increase","grading of recommendations","ulcerative colitis","efficacy","addition","WanFang Databases","evaluation","RCTs","CONCLUSIONS","treatments","inclusion criteria","METHODS","outcomes","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Different studies have demonstrated that the functional diversity of RNAi in animals is linked to the diversification of the Argonaute superfamily, central components of RISCs (RNA induced silencing complexes). The animal Argonaute superfamily is traditionally grouped into AGO and PIWI Argonautes. Yet, by performing phylogenetic analyses and determining the selective evolutionary pressure in the metazoan Argonaute superfamily, we provide evidence for the existence of three conserved Argonaute lineages between basal metazoans and protostomes, namely siRNA-class AGO, miRNA-class AGO and PIWI Argonautes. In addition, it shown that the siRNA-class AGO lineage is characterized by high rates of molecular evolution, suggesting a role in the arms race with viruses, while the miRNA-class AGOs display strong sequence conservation. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that vertebrates lack siRNA-class AGO proteins and that vertebrate AGOs display low rates of molecular evolution. In this way, we provide supportive evidence for the loss of the antiviral siRNA-class AGO group in vertebrates and discuss the consequence hereof on antiviral immunity and the use of RNAi as a loss of function tool in these animals.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wynant, Niels; Santos, Dulce; Vanden Broeck, Jozef","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ffeb9eec90b0ff9624ba2ba11ff573b854b9524.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e71c0074ed227ac2d88dfb5d46934f4e193cdd3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5569025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIWI Argonautes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral siRNA-class","miRNA-class AGOs","vertebrates lack siRNA-class","metazoan Argonaute superfamily","animal Argonaute superfamily","viruses","conserved Argonaute lineages","use of RNAi","animals","addition","PIWI Argonautes","low rates of molecular evolution","high rates of molecular evolution","functional diversity of RNAi","RNA interference","vertebrate AGOs","crucial role","antiviral immunity","supportive evidence","loss of function tool","proteins","mediating regulation of endogenous gene expression","selective evolutionary pressure","central components of RISCs","defense","plants","basal metazoans","protostomes","invertebrates","group","strong sequence conservation","virus-specific siRNAs","consequence","existence","diversification","phylogenetic analyses","silencing complexes","arms race","Different studies","way"],"language":"en"},

Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission: A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.","publish_time":"2017-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirkeby, Carsten; Halasa, Tariq; Gussmann, Maya; Toft, Nils; Gr\u00E6sb\u00F8ll, Kaare","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c99b92996e104f334eddc34bff2f59cabf2abaf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d500adc74b9b731687dd6b3f84c012f7cb5c272d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5572698.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5572698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission rate estimates","epidemiological simulation models","Precise estimates of disease transmission rates","population dynamics","new methods","different SIS models","increased sampling intervals","case of long sampling intervals","accuracy of different methods","measures","simple closed population model","used Poisson regression method","longitudinal field data","realistic dairy herd","tested scenarios","cost","endemic situations","account","size","impact"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this work, we developed the Multiplexed Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (M-NAPPA), which significantly increases the number of displayed proteins by multiplexing as many as five different gene plasmids within a printed spot. Results: Even when proteins of different sizes were displayed within the same feature, they were readily detected using protein-specific antibodies. Protein-protein interactions and serological antibody assays using human viral proteome microarrays demonstrated that comparable hits were detected by M-NAPPA and non-multiplexed NAPPA arrays. An ultra-high density proteome microarray displaying \u003E 16k proteins on a single microscope slide was produced by combining M-NAPPA with a photolithography-based silicon nano-well platform.

MATERIAL/METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2013, 112 patients with virus-induced encephalitis (the case group and 109 healthy individuals (the control group) were recruited for the purposes of this study. The functional variations that IL-4 and IL-10 genes exhibit were detected through the use of a function analysis and selection tool for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (FASTSNP). The genotypes of IL-4 were rs2227283 and IL-4 rs2227288, and the genotypes of IL-10 were rs1800871 and IL-10 rs1800872. These genotypes were respectively assessed using direct sequencing.

Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse, however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins. Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome, it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions, suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo. Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes, and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression, localization and catalytic activity of DUBs. In this review article, we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system, and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR48/UAF1 and WDR20, based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hodul, Molly; Dahlberg, Caroline L.; Juo, Peter","journal":"Front Synaptic Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00352a58c8766861effed18a4b079d1683fec2ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5735123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DUBs function","fewer DUBs","catalytic activity of DUBs","role of ubiquitin ligases","target proteins","DUB activity","DUB USP46","Posttranslational modification of proteins","synapse development","potential mechanisms","multiple regulatory mechanisms","larger protein complexes","WDR20","recent structural studies","specific physiological functions","WDR48","UAF1","expression","nervous system","genetic analyses","WD40-repeat","human genome","synaptic transmission","localization","deubiquitinating enzymes","review article","progress"],"language":"en"},

Although microtubule severing is fundamental to many dynamic neural processes, little is known regarding the role of the family member Katanin p60 subunit A-like 1, KATNAL1, in central nervous system (CNS) function. Recent studies reporting that microdeletions incorporating the KATNAL1 locus in humans result in intellectual disability and microcephaly suggest that KATNAL1 may play a prominent role in the CNS; however, such associations lack the functional data required to highlight potential mechanisms which link the gene to disease symptoms. Here we identify and characterise a mouse line carrying a loss of function allele in Katnal1. We show that mutants express behavioural deficits including in circadian rhythms, sleep, anxiety and learning/memory. Furthermore, in the brains of Katnal1 mutant mice we reveal numerous morphological abnormalities and defects in neuronal migration and morphology. Furthermore we demonstrate defects in the motile cilia of the ventricular ependymal cells of mutants, suggesting a role for Katnal1 in the development of ciliary function. We believe the data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such phenotypes, demonstrating that the protein plays keys roles in a number of processes integral to the development of neuronal function and behaviour.","publish_time":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banks, G; Lassi, G; Hoerder-Suabedissen, A; Tinarelli, F; Simon, M M; Wilcox, A; Lau, P; Lawson, T N; Johnson, S; Rutman, A; Sweeting, M; Chesham, J E; Barnard, A R; Horner, N; Westerberg, H; Smith, L B; Moln\u00E1r, Z; Hastings, M H; Hirst, R A; Tucci, V; Nolan, P M","journal":"Mol Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4cebabd74b16e710fb41a737d8ef84b7d565d8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5761721.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KATNAL1 locus","development of neuronal function","development of ciliary function","brains of Katnal1 mutant mice","loss of function allele","defects","CNS","prominent role","microtubule severing","neuronal migration","functional data","number of processes integral","dynamic neural processes","ventricular ependymal cells of mutants","numerous morphological abnormalities","diverse range of tissue","humans result","intellectual disability","specific molecular functions","sleep","circadian rhythms","protein plays keys roles","anxiety","motile cilia","family member Katanin p60 subunit","microdeletions","microcephaly","central nervous system","potential mechanisms","behavioural deficits","gene","learning","enzymes","mouse line","memory","adulthood","associations","morphology","phenotypes","disease symptoms","Recent studies"],"language":"en"},

Twenty\u2010two (3\u00B76%) children developed at least one symptom compatible with a respiratory viral infection within 1\u20137 days after the visit, including cough (12 children), fever (8), rhinorrhea (7), and/or respiratory distress (1). Three children (0\u00B749%) developed an influenza\u2010like illness. These findings indicate that transmission of respiratory viral infections to children visiting an emergency room during the winter season is extremely low.","publish_time":"2012-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maltezou, Helena C.; Mougkou, Katerina; Asimaki, Hara; Koniaraki, Katerina; Katerelos, Panos; Giannaki, Maria; Theodoridou, Maria","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/350a167243df1d549d23fefc2bc10400be1976f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5780729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","transmission of respiratory viral infections","respiratory distress","emergency room","Respiratory Viruses DOI","winter season","large pediatric hospital","Influenza","rate of transmission","low risk","acquisition","symptom compatible","cough","days","fever","visit","findings","study","paper","Maltezou","aim","rhinorrhea","illness","total"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the prevalence and the clinical impact of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with HCAP. METHODS: Patients admitted with HCAP or CAP, between January and December 2016, to a tertiary referral hospital in Korea, were prospectively enrolled, and virus identification was performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 452 enrolled patients (224 with HCAP, 228 with CAP), samples for respiratory viruses were collected from sputum or endotracheal aspirate in 430 (95.1%) patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 22 (4.9%) patients. Eighty-seven (19.2%) patients had a viral infection, and the proportion of those with viral infection was significantly lower in the HCAP than in the CAP group (13.8% vs 24.6%, p = 0.004). In both the HCAP and CAP groups, influenza A was the most common respiratory virus, followed by entero-rhinovirus. The seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses were also similar in both groups. In the HCAP group, the viral infection resulted in a similar length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality as viral\u2013bacterial coinfection and bacterial infection, and the CAP group showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of viral infection in patients with HCAP was lower than that in patients with CAP, and resulted in a similar prognosis as viral\u2013bacterial coinfection or bacterial infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eun Sun; Park, Kyoung Un; Lee, Sang Hoon; Lee, Yeon Joo; Park, Jong Sun; Cho, Young-Jae; Yoon, Ho Il; Lee, Choon-Taek; Lee, Jae Ho","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1522b3c191730bb3161a610fadb3bf06095ab902.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5813982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5813982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCAP","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial infection","HCAP group","enrolled patients","prevalence of viral infection","adult patients","CAP groups","respiratory viral profile","clinical impact of respiratory virus infection","common respiratory virus","bacterial coinfection","similar results","similar length of hospital","seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses","similar prognosis","virus identification","hospital mortality","tertiary referral hospital","healthcare-associated pneumonia","common etiological factor","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","community","influenza","RT-PCR","Korea","sputum","proportion","entero-rhinovirus","vs","CONCLUSIONS","samples","endotracheal aspirate","nasopharyngeal specimens","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The pathology of Peste des petits ruminants is linked to retrogressive changes and necrotic lesions in lymphoid tissues and epithelial cells. However, the process of PPRV entry into host epithelial cells remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of the entry mechanism of PPRV into caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). We clearly demonstrated that PPRV internalization was inhibited by chloroquine and ammonium chloride, which elevate the pH of various organelles. However, PPRV entry was not affected by chlorpromazine and knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain in EECs. In addition, we found that the internalization of PPRV was dependent on dynamin and membrane cholesterol and was suppressed by silencing of caveolin-1. Macropinocytosis did not play a role, but phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was required for PPRV internalization. Cell type and receptor-dependent differences indicated that PPRV entry into caprine fetal fibroblast cells (FFCs) occurred via a different route. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PPRV enters EECs through a cholesterol-dependent caveolae-mediated uptake mechanism that is pH-dependent and requires dynamin and PI3K but is independent of clathrin. This potentially provides insight into the entry mechanisms of other morbilliviruses.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Bo; Qi, Xuefeng; Guo, Hui; Jia, Peilong; Chen, Shuying; Chen, Zhijie; Wang, Ting; Wang, Jingyu; Xue, Qinghong","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4091e78b118eed89910b5089f4303a51d7e4c4fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5818419.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPRV internalization","internalization of PPRV","entry mechanism of PPRV","process of PPRV entry","pH-dependent","entry mechanisms","EECs","host epithelial cells","caprine endometrial epithelial cells","caprine fetal fibroblast cells","receptor-dependent differences","dynamin","PI3K","cholesterol-dependent caveolae-mediated uptake mechanism","petits ruminants virus","membrane cholesterol","independent of clathrin","pathology of Peste","clathrin heavy chain","pH of various organelles","retrogressive changes","necrotic lesions","lymphoid tissues","FFCs","goats","chlorpromazine","contagious disease of sheep","knockdown","Cell type","chloroquine","ammonium chloride","comprehensive study","role","alarming speed","phosphatidylinositol","kinase","world","different route","silencing of caveolin","insight","morbilliviruses","findings","Macropinocytosis","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study observed the expression of plasma sCD138, a soluble component shedding from the glycocalyx (GCX) to the circulating blood, and evaluated its predictive value on disease severity and prognosis of HFRS. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with HFRS who were treated at our center between January 2011 and December 2013 were randomly enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Thirty-five blood samples from healthy subjects were obtained as the controls. The concentrations of sCD138 were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fib), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of sCD138 among the different types were compared; the correlation among sCD138 and the laboratory parameters mentioned above were analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of sCD138 was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Except for the mild-type, the levels of sCD138 in the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients during the acute stage were significantly higher than that of the convalescent stage and the control (P\u003C0.05). With the aggravation of the disease, the levels of sCD138 during the acute stage had an increasing tendency, while demonstrated no significant difference among the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients (P\u003E0.05). sCD138 was negatively correlated with Fib, PLT and ALB, and was positively correlated with WBC and AST (P\u003C0.05). sCD138 demonstrated predictive effectiveness for prognosis with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 (P\u003C0.001).

METHODS: The contents of the Chinese periodical databases WANFANG, VIP, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for all papers regarding UC or SUC published in last the 15 years (from 2001 to 2015). The number of publications in each year was recorded to assess the temporal trends of research output. All SUC related publications were downloaded and the complexity of this research was evaluated with methods described previously. The number of patients with SUC reported each year was recorded and their clinical characteristics were analyzed using information available in the relevant papers. RESULTS: There were 13499 publications regarding UC published in Chinese medical journals between 2001 and 2015, of which 201 focused on SUC. The number of publications increased rapidly with more than half of all papers being published in the most recent 5-year period. There was a significant increase in analytical studies and clinical trials over the study period (P \u003C 0.01), with research into the management of SUC, included pharmacotherapy, nutrition support as well as surgery, predominating. Almost half (46.2%) of the observational analytical studies and clinical trials focused on Traditional Chinese Medicine, with little research on the efficacy of cyclosporin and infliximab in disease management. About 6222 patients with SUC were reported in the 201 SUC relevant papers, with a ratio of male/female of 1.38. The number of patients reported in each 5-year period significantly increased. The colectomy rate and short-term mortality rate were 7.7% and 0.8% respectively. The most commonly employed operation was total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

Although highly sensitive, in-house PCR assays have been developed to detect airborne pathogen RNA/DNA, it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA/DNA constitutes a true clinical risk. In this case, the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA using a conventional diagnostic assay removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors when they entered the child\u2019s room. No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Julian W.; Hoyle, Elizabeth; Moran, Sammy; Pareek, Manish","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c798963aaa2245c095624af78d5638bebf60c2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5858307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA/DNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detectable adenovirus DNA","outbreaks of adenovirus","respiratory adenovirus","absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA","Air sampling","risk of secondary adenovirus infection","high levels of adenovirus detectable","air samplers","airborne pathogen RNA","subsequent staff infections","multiple air samples","true clinical risk","level of specific pathogen RNA","specific exposed populations","conventional diagnostic assay","thresholds of specific pathogens","pathogen detection methods","infection control","environmental sampling","child\u2019s room","case report","child\u2019s nasopharyngeal aspirates","in-house PCR assays","diagnostic polymerase chain reaction","difference days","requirement","fixed location","face visors","surgical masks","patients","visitors","left free-standing","NPAs","consensus","aid","button sampler","experimental stage"],"language":"en"},

The CUB and its shaping factors in the nuclear genomes of four sequenced cotton species, G. arboreum (A(2)), G. raimondii (D(5)), G. hirsutum (AD(1)) and G. barbadense (AD(2)) were analyzed in the present study. The effective number of codons (ENC) analysis showed the CUB was weak in these four species and the four subgenomes of the two tetraploids. Codon composition analysis revealed these four species preferred to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons. Correlation analysis indicated that the base content at the third position of codons affect the degree of codon preference. PR2-bias plot and ENC-plot analyses revealed that the CUB patterns in these genomes and subgenomes were influenced by combined effects of translational selection, directional mutation and other factors. The translational selection (P2) analysis results, together with the non-significant correlation between GC12 and GC3, further revealed that translational selection played the dominant role over mutation pressure in the codon usage bias. Through relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, we detected 25 high frequency codons preferred to end with T or A, and 31 low frequency codons inclined to end with C or G in these four species and four subgenomes. Finally, 19 to 26 optimal codons with 19 common ones were determined for each species and subgenomes, which preferred to end with A or T. We concluded that the codon usage bias was weak and the translation selection was the main shaping factor in nuclear genes of these four cotton genomes and four subgenomes.","publish_time":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Liyuan; Xing, Huixian; Yuan, Yanchao; Wang, Xianlin; Saeed, Muhammad; Tao, Jincai; Feng, Wei; Zhang, Guihua; Song, Xianliang; Sun, Xuezhen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30420a081a88b98988e277a508b07af7e7acde41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5870960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G. arboreum","G. hirsutum"],"organizations":["CUB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subgenomes","Codon usage bias","Codon composition analysis","position of codons","optimal codons","Correlation analysis","purine-rich codons","low frequency codons","high frequency codons","pyrimidine-rich codons","analysis results","relative synonymous codon usage","effective number of codons","sequenced cotton species","degree of codon preference","translation selection","nuclear genomes","cotton genomes","CUB patterns","PR2-bias plot","combined effects of translational selection","shaping factors","ENC-plot analyses","gene function","nuclear genes","directional mutation","mutation pressure","important information","exogenous gene expression","main shaping factor","important evolutionary feature","non-significant correlation","organism evolution","GC3","dominant role","RSCU","base content","GC12","common ones","P2","arboreum","raimondii","present study","hirsutum","barbadense","tetraploids"],"language":"en"},

Rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the necessity of epidemic modeling studies to evaluate the course of the epidemic and its burden on the health system. This study aims to estimate the total number of infected people, evaluate the consequences of social interventions on the healthcare system and predict the expected number of cases, intensive care needs, hospitalizations and mortality rates in Turkey according to possible scenarios via the SEIR-based epidemic modeling method. Methods: This study was carried out in three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of people infected in the community has been estimated using the number of deaths in Turkey. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, total deaths, total hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) bed needs have been predicted in case of no intervention. In third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has predicted based on SEIR modeling. A simulator (TURKSAS) has been developed and predictions made in 4 scenarios for Turkey. Results: According to deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention (1st scenario), the expected total number of infected people is 72,091,595, the total number of deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88.1%, the mortality ratio is 0.54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to exceed 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity exceeds 3.21-fold. In 2nd and 3rd scenarios according to the calculations made by considering the social compliance rates of the NPIs, the value of R0 is estimated to decrease from 3 to 1.38 level. Compliance with NPIs makes a 94,303 difference in the expected number of deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey healthcare capacity. While this study conducted, curfew for \u003E65 and \u003C20 age groups were in force in Turkey. If the curfew is declared for the 21-64 age population (4th scenario), the R0 value drops below 1 (0.98), the expected deaths are 14,230 and the peak values of daily ICU and non-ICU bed demand are below the healthcare capacity. Discussion: Modeling epidemics with assumptions supported by scientific literature and establishing decision support systems based on objective criteria is an important requirement. According to scientific data for the population of Turkey, the situation is not expected to be of worse than predictions presented in the second dimension. Predictions show that 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 100,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken. Complete control of the pandemic is possible by keeping R0 below 1. For this, additional evidence-based measures are needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ucar, A.; Arslan, S.; Ozdemir, M.

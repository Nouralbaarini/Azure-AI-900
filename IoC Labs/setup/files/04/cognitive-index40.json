A CSF analysis provides a general index of neurologic health, and it often provides evidence of the presence of disease. Similar to a complete blood count, CSF analysis has reasonable sensitivity but low specificity. The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist. Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases. Previous therapy may affect the type, degree, and duration of CSF abnormalities as well.

Incorporation of a protein into a lipid bilayer has significant effects on the properties of the bilayer. The rough surface presented by a protein to the surrounding lipid bilayer tends to produce poor packing unless the lipid fatty acyl chains distort to match the surface of the protein. In a liquid crystalline bilayer the lipid fatty acyl chains are disordered, because the chains undergo extensive wobbling fluctuations. The presence of a rigid protein surface reduces the extent of these motional fluctuations. However, the chains tilt and become conformationally disordered to maximize contact with the rough surface of the protein. The net result is that the presence of a protein leads to decreased order for the chains, with a wide range of chain orientations relative to the bilayer normal, but with reduced extent and rate of motion. Because of the reduced motion, lipids adjacent to membrane proteins are often referred to as being motionally restricted. It is clear that the reasons for the disorder of the bulk lipids and the disorder of the lipids adjacent to the protein are different; for the bulk phospholipids, the disorder is dynamic, whereas, for the boundary lipids the disorder is static.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mall, Sanjay; Malcolm East, J.; Lee, Anthony G.","journal":"Curr Top Membr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3531cb91249c59e74d1cfa5dbc99807fa416f4a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disorder","rigid protein surface","surrounding lipid bilayer","lipid fatty acyl chains","lipid bilayers","bilayer normal","bulk lipids","lipids adjacent","chains tilt","rough surface","boundary lipids","liquid crystalline bilayer","reduced extent","reduced motion","presence","effects of intrinsic membrane proteins","significant effects","bulk phospholipids","rate of motion","motional fluctuations","extensive wobbling fluctuations","poor packing","model transmembrane \u03B1 helices","wide range of chain orientations relative","chapter","properties","decreased order","reasons","net result","contact","Incorporation"],"language":"en"},

There are many financial, ethical, and emotional issues for veterinarians to consider when deciding whether to accept wildlife cases to their practice. Wildlife is not owned and, therefore, does not come with paying caretakers. In many cases, the hospital will be expected to absorb the cost of treatment, although avenues for monetary compensation, including grants and public donations, do exist. Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian\u0027s compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian\u0027s domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. The potential costs of accepting wildlife cases usually include expenses associated with captivity, treatment, release, and failure to reestablish the animal in the wild, as well as the welfare risks to conspeci\uFB01cs and other species through the possible introduction of infection or competition for resources and the upset in natural selection (for example, treating animals that have increased susceptibility to disease may inadvertently select for less \uFB01t animals).

However, the transmissibility of shigellosis remains unclear. METHODS: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a \u201Cknock-out\u201D simulation in four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS: A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range: 5.99 per 100,000 persons \u2013 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend \u03C7(2) = 25,470.27, P \u003C 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0851\u20130.0946) and 1.1264 \u00D7 10(\u2212 9) (95% CI: 4.1123 \u00D7 10(\u2212 10)\u20131.8416 \u00D7 10(\u2212 9)), respectively. The \u201Cknock-out\u201D simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13\u20131.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65\u20131.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qi; Rui, Jia; Hu, Qingqing; Peng, Ying; Zhang, Hao; Zhao, Zeyu; Tong, Yeqing; Wu, Yang; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Guan, Xuhua; Chen, Tianmu","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/699071766da4f82ab66f8c132275b021c46cac72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7136996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D.

Les \u00E9tiologies sont domin\u00E9es par les causes infectieuses, parmi lesquelles les bact\u00E9ries et les virus occupent une place importante. Les virus sont responsables de la forme la plus grave de l\u2019infection [2]. L\u2019objectif de cette \u00E9tude \u00E9tait d\u2019identifier les causes virales des infections respiratoires basses chez les patients adultes.

Surprisingly, we observe through experiments that even in-domain training with standard unsupervised representation learning techniques leads to poor results. We argue that, because of their structured nature, diagram images require more specially-tailored learning objectives. We propose a new method for unsupervised adaptation of out-of-domain feature extractors that asks the model to reason about spatial context. Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained image encoder by requiring it to correctly predict the relative orientation between pairs of nearby image regions. Experiments on the recently released Ikea Diagram Dataset show that our proposed method leads to substantial improvements on a downstream search task, more than doubling recall for certain query categories in the dataset.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jhamtani, Harsh; Berg-Kirkpatrick, Taylor","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df9dc855c36290fc5d870b33831423bf66346df9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148009.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ikea Diagram Dataset"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["engineering diagram images","pre-trained image encoder","Ikea Diagram Dataset","experiments","natural image data","domain feature extractors","domain training","Effective search","pairs of nearby image regions","unsupervised adaptation","proposed method","new method","standard unsupervised representation learning techniques","downstream search task","tailored learning objectives","existing feature extraction models","doubling recall","substantial improvements","larger collections","certain query categories","relative orientation","poor results","reason","spatial context","diagrams","structured nature"],"language":"en"},

We find that such hard queries are those whose constituting tokens (i.e., terms or entities) are not fully or partially observed in the relevant tables. We focus on proposing a latent factor model to address such hard queries. Our proposed model factorizes the token-table co-occurrence matrix into two low dimensional latent factor matrices that can be used for measuring table and query similarity even if no shared tokens exist between them.

Existing works mainly focus on static homogeneous/heterogeneous networks or dynamic homogeneous networks. However, dynamic heterogeneous networks are more ubiquitous in reality, e.g. social network, e-commerce network, citation network, etc. There is still a lack of research on dynamic heterogeneous graph embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph embedding method using hierarchical attentions (DyHAN) that learns node embeddings leveraging both structural heterogeneity and temporal evolution. We evaluate our method on three real-world datasets. The results show that DyHAN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of link prediction task.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Luwei; Xiao, Zhibo; Jiang, Wen; Wei, Yi; Hu, Yi; Wang, Hao","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe5b25c6cf8de37823907c3aed7738ea393902e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynamic heterogeneous networks","dynamic homogeneous networks","novel dynamic heterogeneous graph","social network","e-commerce network","citation network","DyHAN","method","lack of research","research interests","various state-of-the-art baselines","reality","hierarchical attentions","terms of link prediction task","structural heterogeneity","node embeddings","temporal evolution","results","Existing works","real-world datasets","paper"],"language":"en"},

The typical process of constructing search strategies is often undocumented, ad-hoc, and subject to individual expertise, which may introduce bias in the systematic review. A new method for objectively deriving search strategies has arisen from information specialists attempting to address these shortcomings. However, this proposed method still presents a number of manual, ad-hoc interventions, and trial-and-error processes, potentially still introducing bias into systematic reviews. Moreover, this method has not been rigorously evaluated on a large set of systematic review cases, thus its generalisability is unknown. In this work, we present a computational adaptation of this proposed objective method. Our adaptation removes the human-in-the-loop processes involved in the initial steps of creating a search strategy for a systematic review; reducing bias due to human factors and increasing the objectivity of the originally proposed method. Our proposed computational adaptation further enables a formal and rigorous evaluation over a large set of systematic reviews. We find that our computational adaptation of the original objective method provides an effective starting point for information specialists to continue refining. We also identify a number of avenues for extending and improving our adaptation to further promote supporting information specialists.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scells, Harrisen; Zuccon, Guido; Koopman, Bevan; Clark, Justin","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adff49d42bca8c91c33a353436c12210606c7e8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed method","proposed objective method","proposed computational adaptation","new method","search strategies","search strategy","original objective method","bias","large set of systematic review cases","large set of systematic reviews","supporting information specialists","expert information specialist","loop processes","error processes","human factors","number of manual","number of avenues","effective starting point","initial steps","rigorous evaluation","trial","generalisability","objectivity","subject","interventions","individual expertise","typical process","shortcomings","work","literature"],"language":"en"},

However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5\u2032-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5\u2032-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.","publish_time":"2013-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbas, Yazan M.; Pichlmair, Andreas; G\u00F3rna, Maria W.; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Nagar, Bhushan","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8998c16e58fa4d41fe2b226c721fb898d2a8eb74.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2bf8ae683ef919a724c5623efda3a71110d57ddd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24a4abb7e742c132b76b859fd53acfc1a126ba05.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e541cde18344acd8299e4bcfdf4d81a86206321b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4931921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4931921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFIT","HEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","host RNA","RNA binding","single stranded PPP-RNA","PPP-RNAs","Abrogation of PPP","canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA","anti-viral response","IFIT proteins","protein interactions","disruption of protein","crystal structures of human IFIT5","immune effector molecules","downstream effector function","host translation initiation machinery","N-terminal fragment of IFIT1","RIG-","proteolysis","gel-shift assays","Mutational analysis","interferon-inducible","complex","insight","antiviral defence","HEK cells","defect","non-sequence specific manner","new helical domain","triphosphate group","mechanism","molecular signature","cavity","results","IFITs","nucleotide","overhang"],"language":"en"},

CEPI is faced with complex decisions that involve confronting trade\u2010offs between multiple objectives, diverse stakeholder perspectives, and uncertainty in vaccine performance. OBJECTIVE: This study reports on a multi\u2010criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and its testing on CEPI decisions. METHODS: Consultations with CEPI\u0027s Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) and document reviews helped identify and structure the criteria against which to evaluate proposals. Forty four subject\u2010matter experts assessed performance of 18 proposals on multiple criteria. SAC preferences were elicited via a survey employing an adapted swing\u2010weighting technique and were incorporated into measures of value and cost\u2010to\u2010value. A Monte Carlo simulation estimated overall value and ranking probabilities by value and by cost\u2010to\u2010value for each proposal. RESULTS: Reviewer assessments and SAC preferences varied significantly. Despite this uncertainty, 14 preferred proposals emerged from the analysis and SAC recommendations on the basis of value and cost\u2010to\u2010value. In some cases, SAC recommendations deviated from the analysis because of: less emphasis on cost\u2010to\u2010value if budgets seemed underestimated by applicants, more emphasis on the likelihood of generating vaccines for target pathogens versus platform potential against unknown pathogens, and emphasis on funding a diversity of platforms per pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Despite vaccine performance uncertainty and stakeholder preference heterogeneity, MCDA distinguished between options in a way that broadly corresponded to decisions. Divergence between the MCDA and the SAC point to potential updates needed to the model such as platform diversity trade\u2010offs.","publish_time":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gouglas, Dimitrios; Marsh, Kevin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ad866c07f8cd10139fc9dbe2fa6ea225bdc876f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEPI","Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","CEPI\u0027s Scientific Advisory Committee","SAC","MCDA"],"locations":["Monte Carlo"],"keyphrases":["overall value","basis of value","measures of value","SAC recommendations","SAC preferences","cost","SAC point","MCDA","vaccine performance uncertainty","emphasis","CEPI decisions","multiple criteria","preferred proposals","platform potential","vaccine development","multi\u2010criteria decision analysis","platform diversity trade\u2010offs","complex decisions","unknown pathogens","target pathogens","confronting trade\u2010offs","multiple objectives","potential updates","diversity of platforms","diverse stakeholder perspectives","stakeholder preference heterogeneity","CEPI\u0027s Scientific Advisory Committee","ranking probabilities","funding","vaccines","study reports","Consultations","Coalition","Lassa","likelihood","Monte Carlo simulation","survey","model","applicants","weighting technique","adapted swing","METHODS","Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","MERS","options","document reviews","RESULTS","Reviewer assessments","matter experts","CfP","budgets","testing","way","CONCLUSIONS","Nipah","cases","Divergence","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal or other pathogens. The study of pneumonia aetiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the aetiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. The paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population aetiology distribution and the individual aetiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study of 9500 children for seven sites around the world. We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially latent class model (PLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case\u2013control study. We introduce the PLCM as an extension of the latent class model. We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent class frequencies.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate (1) the relation between the MBL pathway and postoperative infectious complications and survival of patients resected for colorectal cancer and (2) the role of MBL as acute phase reactant compared to CRP. Methods: Preoperative MBL concentration, MBL/MBL\u2010associated serine protease (MASP) activity and CRP were determined in serum from 611 patients and 150 healthy controls. The patients were observed for 8 years. Postoperative infections, recurrence and survival were recorded. Results: The MBL pathway components were increased in the patients (P \u003C 0.0001) compared to healthy controls. Low MBL levels were predictive of pneumonia (P = 0.01), and pneumonia (n = 87) was associated with poor survival (P = 0.003, HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.9).

The database represents a computer\u2010based replacement for the laboratory notebooks used in the majority of research laboratories worldwide. In addition, the database provides an effective tool for organizing and managing laboratory information at all levels, spanning from managing and revising standard operating procedures and producing documentation of research activities to keeping track of data and conclusions. Using the commercially available database toolkit software filemaker pro, we have developed a relational database solution for management of laboratory information. The system consists of a hierarchy of five interrelated databases, each pertaining to a separate type of information, namely, overall project information, information relating to individual experiment setups, documentation of daily research activity, generated data and descriptions of standard operating procedures. Like other databases, each individual database consists of a number of records, each comprised of a set of fields in which information is entered. In each record, a certain field is reserved to specify the relation of the record to a record in another database at a higher level. Thus, the database is essentially five databases linked by a hierarchy of one\u2010to\u2010many relations, organizing information in a folder\u2010like structure. Importantly, the database system allows multiple users to access and edit records simultaneously, and the data entered in one database immediately becomes accessible through the other databases. The limitations of laboratory notebooks are apparent when looking for information, which is dispersed throughout one or more notebooks, or possibly on loose sheets of paper or printouts \u2018somewhere\u2019. The often complicated process of gathering laboratory data or results when writing grant applications or research papers is made considerably easier with the database system. Thus, the database solution presented should be broadly attractive to researchers, irrespective of their scientific discipline.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, M.

We evaluated the presence of the following autoantibodies: rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), antibodies against cadiolipin (a\u2010CL) and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti\u2010CCP). Methods: We studied the presence of RF, ANA, a\u2010CL and anti\u2010CCP in 40 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor was measured using nephelometric method, while ANAs were examined by indirect immunofluorescence technique using Hep\u20102 cells as substrate. Sera that reacted at 1/80 dilution were classified as ANA positive. Positive sera were studied up to 1/1280 dilution. A\u2010CL and anti\u2010CCP were measured by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. Results: RF was positive in 30 patients (75%), ANA in 15 (37%), a\u2010CL in 10 (25%) and anti\u2010CCP in 36 (90%). Predominant pattern of nuclear staining of ANA\u2010positive sera was homogenous and speckled type. ANA titres were particularly low; most patients (6) had ANA titre equal to 1/80, and five patients had a titre of 1/160, while only four out of 40 had an ANA titre of 1/320. Conclusions: Autoimmune disorders such as RA are characterized by various autoantibodies that usually are not specific, as they are present in many other diseases. However, RF and especially anti\u2010CCP are very often and show higher specificity for RA, being useful diagnostic serological markers. On the other hand, ANA and a\u2010CL are less common in RA paitents; they may be useful in terms of prognosis and treatment, but they always should be evaluated in correlation with the clinical features and the rest of the laboratory findings of each patient.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Astrinidou\u2010Vakaloudi, A.; Diamanti, I.; Xytsas, S.; Xatzidimitriou, D.; Georgakopoulou, E.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec1d9ff81496d6badb553d83b2abdaf51d35e85.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["ANA","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ANA positive","patients","anti\u2010CCP","ANA titres","ANA titre equal","Positive sera","rheumatoid factor","rheumatoid arthritis","presence of RF","Predominant pattern of nuclear staining of ANA","ANAs","antinuclear antibodies","RA paitents","dilution","aim","useful diagnostic serological markers","following autoantibodies","various autoantibodies","diagnostic value of autoanitbodies","enzyme","cyclic citrullinated peptide","indirect immunofluorescence technique","rest","cells","speckled type","nephelometric method","higher specificity","clinical features","laboratory findings","linked immunosorbent assay","terms of prognosis","treatment","Conclusions","Autoimmune disorders","study","correlation","substrate","cadiolipin","Results","diseases","Methods","hand"],"language":"en"},

Result: In contrast to previous findings of elevated sTNFR levels in patients with various chronic inflammatory diseases, we found slightly reduced sTNFR\u2010I levels in JIA patients (n = 123) compared with age\u2010matched healthy controls (n = 37): 1077 pg/ml (819\u20132280) versus 1185 pg/ml (625\u20132303) [median (range)], P = 0015. However, the sTNFR\u2010I levels correlated positively with the number of active joints, physicians\u0027 global assessment and CRP. In contrast, patient LTBC values were elevated compared to healthy controls: 44 AU (36\u201352) versus 31 AU (13\u201341), P \u003C 0.0001. Conclusion: Despite overall slightly reduced plasma levels of sTNFR\u2010I, the capacity to bind TNF was increased in plasma samples from JIA patients. Studies to identify the TNF\u2010binding substances in plasma are in progress.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bjoernhart, B.; Svenningsen, P.; Gudbrandsdottir, S.; Zak, M.; Nielsen, S.; Bentzen, K.; M\u00FCller, K.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60faef52bf6546591f62af9cb4a3a0e3fff99cbb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reduced plasma levels of sTNFR","reduced sTNFR","JIA patients","TNF system","previous findings of elevated sTNFR levels","Detectable LT","unbound LT","natural inhibitors of TNF","soluble TNF receptors","diluted plasma samples","percentage value of bound LT","binding capacity","contrast","patient LTBC values","pg","matched healthy controls","rheumatoid arthritis","binding substances","in\u2010house ELISA","juvenile idiopathic arthritis","various chronic inflammatory diseases","disease progression","physicians\u0027 global assessment","number of active joints","Result","Unbalanced production of proinflammatory cytokines","agonists","AUs","Background","CRP","induced inflammation","lymphotoxin","arbitrary units","range","Conclusion","Studies","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The nidoviruses genome is an infectious, linear, positive sense RNA molecule, which is capped and polyadenylated. Based on the genome size, they are divided into two groups large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Based on the genome size, they can be distinguished into two groups, large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Although the structural proteins of the nidoviruses are generally functionally equivalent, there is no firm indication that any single protein species is evolutionary conserved across all of the families. Members of the family Coronaviridae generally possess three or four envelope proteins. The most abundant one is the membrane (M) protein. Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro-, and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure, and presumably also in function. Nidoviruses have lipid envelopes, which are commonly acquired by budding at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and/or Golgi complex.

Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability, have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5\u20131.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9\u201310. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10\u201311) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillusclausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, O.P.","journal":"Comprehensive Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Subtilisin Carlsberg"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteases account","disease-causing proteases","generation of detergent proteases","production of heterologous proteases","principal applications of proteases","related subtilisin serine proteases","enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases","Microbial protease","largest protease application segment","organic synthesis","annual market","industrial enzyme market","total enzyme market","annual protease sales","food processing","development of protease inhibitors","largest segment","production of protein hydrolysates","protein engineering","greater temperature stability","higher pH optima","significant roles","diverse roles","Subtilisin Carlsberg","genetic engineering","alkalophilic strains","directed evolution","Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers","abnormal physiological functioning","genomes of key Bacillus","cereal mashing","therapy","effective tools","carboxylic acids","beer haze clarification","mutation","selection strategies","baking","therapeutic agents","brewing","amide bonds","new enzymes","substantial momentum","digestive aids","thrombosis","ester","conventional screening","species","fabric","nutrition","regulatory aspects of cells","resolution of pairs","coagulation step","hydrolysis of peptide","Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity","active sites","mutagenesis","viral pathophysiological conditions","altered specificity","leather","catalysts","biosystems","viscoelastic properties of dough","Complete sequencing","cheese","cancer treatment","organisms","enantiomers","Bacillusclausii","halodurans","techniques","detergents","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

Igs are divided into classes having different physico-chemical structures and biological activities. The major Ig classes in bovine and human milk are IgA, IgG and IgM. Bovine colostral Igs provide the newborn calf with passive immune protection against microbial infections until the calf\u2019s own immune system matures. Colostral Ig preparations designed for farm animals have been commercially available for many years. Potential health benefits attributed to bovine colostrum have increased manufacture and marketing of colostral Ig-based dietary supplements also for human use. Furthermore, specific anti-microbial antibodies can be produced into colostrum by immunizing cows with vaccines made of pathogenic microorganisms. These antibodies can be concentrated and used to formulate so-called immune milk preparations. Such preparations have proven effective in prevention of animal and human infections caused, e.g. by rotavirus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptosporidium parvum and Helicobacter pylori. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems limited. A few immune milk products have been commercialized and more can be expected in the future for use, e.g. as a supportive means in antibiotic treatments and for prevention of hospital infections.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korhonen, H.J.; Marnila, P.","journal":"Dairy-Derived Ingredients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella","Helicobacter"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human milk","bovine colostrum","human infections","Bovine colostral Igs","Colostral Ig preparations","immune milk products","so-called immune milk preparations","microbial infections","human use","immune system","marketing of colostral Ig","passive immune protection","prevention of hospital infections","major Ig classes","specific anti-microbial antibodies","prevention of animal","Streptococcus mutans","Clostridium difficile","Escherichia coli","newborn calf","Cryptosporidium parvum","different physico-chemical structures","rotavirus","Shigella flexneri","antibiotic treatments","dietary supplements","vaccines","calf\u2019s","farm animals","IgA","manufacture","biological activities","Helicobacter pylori","supportive means","immunizing cows","Potential health benefits","IgG","pathogenic microorganisms","IgM","lactating species","therapeutic efficacy","years","future","Immunoglobulins"],"language":"en"},

This chapter is organized primarily as a general discussion of the clinical problem of pneumonia. As appropriate, the focus on individual etiologic agents highlights some characteristic features of each that are particularly useful to the physician. Also covered is a commonly used categorization of pneumonia based on the clinical setting: community-acquired versus nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. In current clinical practice, the approach to evaluation and management of these two types of pneumonia is often quite different. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of several infections that were uncommon or primarily of historical interest until recently, as the threat of bioterrorism emerged. In addition to reviewing inhalational anthrax, the chapter briefly describes two other organisms considered to be of concern as potential weapons of bioterrorism: Yersinia pestis (the cause of plague) and Francisella tularensis (the cause of tularemia).","publish_time":"2018-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weinberger, Steven E.; Cockrill, Barbara A.; Mandel, Jess","journal":"Principles of Pulmonary Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Francisella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical problem of pneumonia","types of pneumonia","chapter","used categorization of pneumonia","clinical setting","current clinical practice","cause of plague","cause of tularemia","general discussion","brief discussion","threat of bioterrorism","potential weapons of bioterrorism","Yersinia pestis","individual etiologic agents","approach","evaluation","Francisella tularensis","characteristic features","focus","concern","community","management","important categories of disease","respiratory system","infections","inhalational anthrax","pulmonary parenchyma","hospital","addition","organisms","criteria","physician"],"language":"en"},

This clearance reduction may alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol and worsen the predictive performance of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The head-down position (HDP) and CO2 pneumoperitoneum, which are required for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), may cause changes in CO. We investigated the predictive performance of propofol TCI during CO2 pneumoperitoneum in patients who underwent RALP in the HDP. METHODS Fifteen male patients received propofol TCI using the Diprifusor model. Propofol concentrations were measured at seven time points: (T1) 15 min after anesthesia induction; (T2) before the insufflation; (T3, T4, and T5) 15, 60, and 90 min, respectively, after insufflation in the HDP; (T6) before the release of pneumoperitoneum in the HDP; and (T7) 15 min after the release of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position. Cardiac index (CI) was assessed using an arterial pulse contour CO monitor. The predictive performance of propofol TCI was evaluated by calculating the performance errors (PE) in propofol concentrations for each data point. The relationship between CI and PE was examined. Median PE (MDPE) and median absolute PE (MDAPE) were calculated as measures of bias and accuracy, respectively. RESULTS A total of 104 blood samples were analyzed. There was significantly negative correlation between CI and PE. The predictive performance of propofol TCI during pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable (MDPE = - 1.5% and MDAPE = 18.8%). CONCLUSION The predictive performance of propofol TCI during RALP with CO2 pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogawa, Tomoko; Obara, Shinju; Akino, Mitsue; Hanayama, Chie; Ishido, Hidemi; Murakawa, Masahiro","journal":"Journal of anesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02765-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCI","HDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predictive performance of propofol TCI","Propofol concentrations","HDP","pharmacokinetics of propofol","CO2 pneumoperitoneum","PURPOSE Propofol clearance","predictive performance of target","release of pneumoperitoneum","performance errors","Median PE","RALP","median absolute PE","MDPE","insufflation","MDAPE","male patients","supine position","clearance reduction","cardiac output","Cardiac index","controlled infusion","T1","METHODS","T6","CONCLUSION","time points","arterial pulse contour","Diprifusor model","anesthesia induction","monitor","T3","T4","T2","laparoscopic prostatectomy","negative correlation","data point","measures of bias","total","blood samples","accuracy","T5","T7","head","relationship","changes"],"language":"en"},

The amazing conglomeration of traditions, beliefs, sorrows and philosophies that together constitute and vitalize the religion of tribes has descended from antiquity and has been preserved unimpaired to the present day. Every dimension of their life covering round the year activities is intimately connected with religion and the world view associated with it. It is these aspects of their culture that give meaning and depth to their lives and solidarity to their social structure.

As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for health care workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks, and goggles. Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols form entering the respiratory system. Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose. Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95% or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 micrometer. This review discusses respirators, their purpose, typs, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Umer, F; Haji, Z; Zafar, K","journal":"International endodontic journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/iej.13313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Various types of respirators","particle filtering efficiency","half-mask filtering facepiece respirators","contaminated aerosols form","health care workers","health care professionals","clinical efficiency","tight seal","tight fitting","used FFR","Surgical masks","median particle size","FFRs","correct personal protective equipment","PPE","proper donning","typs","N95 disposable respirator","powered air","gowns","droplets","forefront","pandemic","fluid penetration","healthcare settings","purpose","doffing techniques","droplet inhalation","respiratory system","common route of transmission","ongoing COVID","better protection","SARS","mouth","nose","micrometer","PAPRs","infectious corona virus","influenza","goggles","review"],"language":"en"},

VS for DIP of 1.57\u00B10.29 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm-2 \u00B7 d-1 and DIN of 15.6\u00B14.3 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm-2 \u00B7 d-1 , as well as VM for DIP of 0.57\u00B10.22 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm-2 \u00B7 d-1 and DIN of 5.6\u00B12.1 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm-2 \u00B7 d-1 were calculated. In addition, an absolute size of the internal storage capacity (ISC) for DIP of 22 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm2 and DIN of 222 \u00B5mol \u00B7 cm2 was determined. A DIP to DIN uptake ratio of 1:10 under VM showed a weekly rhythmic uptake pattern, highlighted by a high correlation between DIP and DIN uptake (R=0.943). VS for DIN did not occur under DIP depletion, but uptake rates increased with increasing DIP availability. Hence, DIP availability limited access to DIN, which was also reflected by total dissolvable protein concentrations in sporophytes, which ranged from 10.2\u00B12.5% to 24.6\u00B18.0% dry weight depending on DIP availability. Similarly, total dissolvable carbohydrate concentration ranged from 22.1\u00B13.6% to 54.3\u00B112.3% dry weight.

It appears to work in tandem with vitamin D, a secosteroid pro-hormone which reportedly acts as a negative regulatory factor of the RAS [3-6]. A dysfunction (e.g. over-reactivity) of RAS, together with hypovitaminosis D, is likely associated with some of the various renal, cardiac, vascular and immune outcomes that might be observed in COVID-19 patients, including the cytokine storm (i.e. unopposed hyperactive immune reaction generating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and consequent lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 7]. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14]. All these diffuse COVID-19 disorders are likely linked to an over-reaction of RAS in SARS-CoV-2-infected persons. Such a RAS imbalance would be also favored by hypovitaminosis D [2-7, 11]. Since RAS appears to be central in COVID-19 symptoms/diseases, selective targeting of key component(s) of this system might be appropriate to treat RAS-dependent disorders. COVID-19 Disorders: \u0027Renin-Angiotensin\u0027 System (RAS) \u0026 Counter-regulatory RAS In the RAS pathway [1, 15], Renin (kidney) cleaves Angiotensinogen (liver) to give Angiotensin I (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFHL). The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host). When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). Angiotensin 1-7 can be further transformed to Alamandine (i.e. peptide ARVYIHP) by an aspartate decarboxylase. Alamandine would bind to the vasodilatator Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) thus promoting most of the Angiotensin 1-7-like effects. Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. In the RAS pathway were finally evidenced the related Angiotensin III (i.e. peptide RVYIHPF) and Angiotensin IV (i.e. peptide VYIHPF) variants targeting the AT1R and vasodilatator AT4R, respectively. From the known molecular functioning of the RAS, Angiotensins I and II (aside Angiotensin III) are playing central roles in the activity of RAS and associated pathologies, including COVID-19 [2, 10]. Interestingly, it appears that a \u0027counter-regulatory\u0027 RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. These peptides were found to exhibit cardioprotective, vasoactive (anti-hypertensive), anti-hypertrophic and/or anti-inflammatory potentials [15]. Such naturally-produced molecules of the RAS are expected to counteract the SARS-CoV-2-induced over-activation of RAS and reverse, to some extent, the associated COVID-19 diseases. CONCLUDING REMARKS A recent report suggests that RAS inhibitors may act on the severity of viral infection and mortality of COVID-19 patients [14]. Whether or not RAS blockers would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases is still controversial. The RAS inhibitors likely prevent the cytokine storm as RAS is reported to control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 7]. It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. The track for a possible COVID-19 treatment would be to target RAS using specific candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives. Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. We support the use of natural candidate peptide drugs that belong to the \u0027counter-regulatory\u0027 RAS, i.e. Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A and/or Angiotensin IV to treat COVID-19 disorders. The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.

Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment. Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care.

Indications include refractory Cushing\u0027s disease (CD) following failed pituitary surgery, and occult or unresectable ectopic ACTH-producing neoplasms (EA). METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective review (1995-2017) of patients undergoing BA for CD or EA. Demographics, laboratory findings, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were analyzed. RESULTS Of 137 patients, 83 (61%) had CD and 54 (39%) had EA; 87% of CD patients were female versus 46% of EA patients (p \u003C 0.0001). Mean age at diagnosis was 40 \u00B1 15 years for CD and 49 \u00B1 18 years for EA (p = 0.004). Preoperative serum cortisol concentrations were higher in the EA cohort (63 \u00B1 40 \u03BCg/dL) versus the CD cohort (33 \u00B1 19 \u03BCg/dL) [p \u003C 0.001], with no significant differences in serum ACTH. Time from diagnosis until adrenalectomy was 54 \u00B1 69 months for CD versus 4 \u00B1 13 for EA (p = 0.002). Most patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS; 86% CD vs. 75% EA; p = 0.19). There was no difference between the rates of conversion to an open approach, intraoperative blood loss, or operative time between groups, and no difference between complications in CD versus EA (p = 1.0). Five-year survival was significantly shorter among the EA cohort (30% for EA vs. 80% for CD; p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION Patients with EA presented with higher serum cortisol levels compared with patients with CD. EA patients were more likely to require intraoperative transfusion and postoperative intensive care. BA in patients with CD and EA can be performed safely in an MIS fashion, with similar morbidity; however, survival at 5 years was significantly less in the EA cohort.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szabo Yamashita, Thomas; Sada, Alaa; Bancos, Irina; Young, William F; Dy, Benzon M; Farley, David R; Lyden, Melanie L; Thompson, Geoffrey B; McKenzie, Travis J","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08451-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EA patients","CD patients","EA cohort","CD cohort","CONCLUSION Patients","serum ACTH","years","intraoperative transfusion","higher serum cortisol levels","\u03BCg","diagnosis","Preoperative serum cortisol concentrations","intraoperative blood loss","unresectable ectopic ACTH","operative time","invasive surgery","postoperative variables","MIS fashion","Five-year survival","failed pituitary surgery","postoperative intensive care","BACKGROUND Bilateral adrenalectomy","open approach","occult","corticotropin","laboratory findings","groups","refractory Cushing\u0027s disease","hypercortisolism","curative treatment","Demographics","complications","rates of conversion","single-center","similar morbidity","Indications","neoplasms","dependent Cushing syndrome","female","retrospective review","significant differences","METHODS","Mean age","months","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context. The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine, alone, or in combination with diazepam. In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled interventional studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during, and (iii) after chloroquine; and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats, and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline. KEY RESULTS Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between interventions and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and, as with clonazepam, also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Neither diazepam, nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites, protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity. However, diazepam may augment the effe cts of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hughes, Dyfrig A","journal":"British journal of pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of diazepam","use of chloroquine","attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity","experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity","Combined administration of diazepam","KEY RESULTS Chloroquine","study","Diazepam increased heart rate","pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats","urethane-anaesthetised rats","cardiac tissues","Cardiac arrhythmias","cardiac contractility","models of toxicity","clonazepam","adrenaline","dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic","EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH","high dose","interventional studies","impairment of atrioventricular conduction","effective refractory period of atria","developed tension of left atria","recent cases of fatal toxicity","ventricular tissue","papillary muscles","COVID","ligands","experiments","benzodiazepine binding sites","electrocardiographic parameters","PURPOSE Resurgence","putative treatment","positive inotropes","Ro5","unintentional overdoses","pharmacology","efficacy","BACKGROUND","QTc interval","management of poisoning","uncertainties","IMPLICATIONS","rabbits","differences","interventions","control","context","Protocols","hypokalaemia","CONCLUSION","combination","aim","prior"],"language":"en"},

In her view, a central problem is that the definition of pandemics is based solely on disease transmission across several countries, and not on spread and severity together, which conflates two very different situations: emergency and nonemergency disease outbreaks. A greater emphasis on severity, such that pandemics are defined as severe and rapidly spreading infectious disease outbreaks, would make them \u0022true global health emergencies,\u0022 allowing for priority resource allocation and effective collective actions in emergency response efforts.

To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:\u003C0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy.

For the da Vinci Xi system, multichannel port and \u0022Lap Single Vision\u0022 port access platform were placed through a single periumbilical incision. Results Fourteen patients underwent single-site surgery with benign cases (n=9) and partial nephrectomy cases (n=5). Among surgeries for the partial nephrectomy patients, one case of conversion to multiport robotic surgery occurred due to difficulty of tumor resection. Other major intraoperative complication, renal vein injury, was occurred in a patient who underwent a pyelolithotomy. The patient required a blood transfusion however, we were able to repair the vascular injury using prolene suture without additional port placement and open conversion. In our series, there were no conversions to open. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients; only Clavien-Dindo III complications occurred. Conclusions Our preliminary experience with robot laparoendoscopic single-site surgery using the da Vinci Xi system demonstrated feasibility and safety in selected patients. Further studies with a greater number of patients in multiple settings will help to fully elucidate the role of da Vinci Xi surgical system in single-site surgery.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hyung Ho; Na, Joon Chae; Yoon, Young Eun; Rha, Koon Ho; Han, Woong Kyu","journal":"Investigative and clinical urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4111/icu.2020.61.3.323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Xi single-site platform","Vinci Xi system","single surgeon","postoperative outcomes of robot laparoendoscopic single-site surgery","Vinci Xi robot surgical system","Lap Single Vision","single periumbilical incision","selected patients","invasive surgery","partial nephrectomy patients","multiport robotic surgery","greater number of patients","port access platform","multichannel port","Methods Retrospective chart review of patients","partial nephrectomy cases","open conversion","additional port placement","previous Si platform","vascular injury","case of conversion","benign cases","postoperative course","renal vein injury","major intraoperative complication","prolene suture","feasibility","safety","preliminary experience","Materials","modifications","multiple settings","Conclusions","Clavien-Dindo","difficulty of tumor resection","blood transfusion","upgrades","studies","capabilities","surgeries","Results","complications","conversions","series","pyelolithotomy","study"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies have produced conflicting data regarding seasonal association of TTP diagnoses. This study evaluated the seasonal distribution of acute TTP in southern Louisiana. Additionally, this study timeline overlapped with the initiation of a new screening protocol for ADAMTS13 testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients receiving ADAMTS13 testing at Ochsner Medical Center from January 2010 to December 2017 was performed. TTP patient episodes were defined by ADAMTS13 activity \u003C10%. Episodes were plotted according to season of presentation and a chi-square analysis was performed. Data of identified TTP patients was analyzed to evaluate for confounding variables. ADAMTS13 order volumes and results before and after screening protocol implementation were compared. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-two ADAMTS13 tests were ordered on 245 unique patients. Twenty-five patients had ADAMTS13 activity \u003C10%. No significant differences in seasonal TTP case distribution were identified. Patients with confirmed TTP were younger and more likely to be Black or African American. A screening protocol did not decrease the number of annual ADAMTS13 test orders in our time frame, but was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of positive results. CONCLUSION No significant seasonal distribution of TTP was identified in our population. This analysis provides previously unexamined regional information regarding this diagnosis. The number of tests ordered after the implementation of the screening protocol increased, corresponding with our facility\u0027s expanding reach.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simenson, Victoria; Burton, Jeffrey; Del Toro, Alejandra; Alquist, Caroline Raasch","journal":"Journal of clinical apheresis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jca.21786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TTP"],"locations":["southern Louisiana","Ochsner Medical Center"],"keyphrases":["ADAMTS13 testing","ADAMTS13 tests","ADAMTS13 activity","confirmed TTP","inactivation of ADAMTS13","Data of identified TTP patients","significant seasonal distribution of TTP","seasonal distribution of acute TTP","seasonal TTP case distribution","TTP patient episodes","seasonal association of TTP diagnoses","ADAMTS13 order volumes","screening protocol implementation","retrospective analysis of patients","unique patients","new screening protocol","number of annual ADAMTS13 test orders","chi-square analysis","number of tests","STUDY DESIGN","study timeline","percentage of positive results","conflicting data","significant differences","METHODS","initiation","Ochsner Medical Center","time frame","life-threatening disorder","southern Louisiana","BACKGROUND Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","unexamined regional information","CONCLUSION","nonsignificant increase","season of presentation","Previous studies","thrombocytopenia","microangiopathic hemolytic anemia","diagnosis","facility\u0027s expanding reach","confounding variables","population"],"language":"en"},

Because of their huge burden and the vulnerability imposed during a health crisis, prevention and care of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will need to be prioritized even further. Maternal and child health are inextricably linked with NCDs and their risk factors. The intergenerational impact of poor maternal nutrition and health conditions during pregnancy, particularly NCD-related pregnancy complications, can be considered as a multiplier of the ongoing pandemic of NCDs. The economic cost of poor maternal health and NCD-related pregnancy complications is likely very high, but is not adequately researched or documented in the context of long-term population health. Interventions to address NCDs in pregnancy have beneficial effects on short-term pregnancy outcomes; but even more importantly, identifying \u0022at-risk\u0022 mothers and offspring opens up the opportunity for targeted early preventive action. Preventive actions to address obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have a common lifestyle approach-identifying any one of these problems in pregnancy provides an opportunity to address them all.

The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men. The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count. The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%). Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon \u03B12b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription. The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-\u03B12b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously. Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter. We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-\u03B12b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Qiong; Deng, Xuanyu; Li, Yongzhong; Sun, Xuexiong; Chen, Qiong; Xie, Mingxuan; Liu, Shao; Qu, Hui; Liu, Shouxian; Wang, Ling; He, Gefei; Gong, Zhicheng","journal":"International journal of clinical pharmacy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-020-01031-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["First Hospital","First People\u0027s Hospital"],"locations":["China","Hunan"],"keyphrases":["common-type COVID","symptoms of COVID","common symptoms","severe COVID","Background Clinical characteristics of patients","confirmed COVID","common-type group","therapeutic methods of COVID","antibiotics treatment","outcome of treatment","treatment benefits","common patterns","severe-type","novaferon","interferon-\u03B12b","days","antibiotic treatment","treatment measures","China","Hunan province","Hospital of Changsha","hospital admission","clinical investigations","medical history","laboratory findings","laboratory parameters","recombinant human interferon \u03B12b","Central Hospital of Loudi","People\u0027s Hospital of Huaihua","radiological characteristics","median time","median age","study population","study centers","epicenter of Wuhan","eosinophil count","median length of stay","reduced WBC count","exposure history","systematic corticosteroids","eosinophil ratio","electronic medical records","computer tomography scans","chest-computed tomography","Main outcome measure Epidemiological","demographics","signs","underlying comorbidities","lopinavir","ritonavir","retrospective multi-center case-series analysis","traditional Chinese medicine prescription","mild comparing","corticosteroid therapies","diagnosis","ground-glass opacity","coronavirus disease","Pharmacotherapy","onset of illness","following data","fever","treatments","patchy bilateral shadowing","cough","Objective","fatigue","total","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

However, the use of a high-frequency electrotome under the microscope can significantly reduce bleeding and reduce the risk of surgery. Aim To explore the clinical significance of electrosurgical excision of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical anterior approach under the microscope. Material and methods From December 2015 to December 2017, patients who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at our hospital were followed up. We enrolled 73 men and 50 women who were 30 to 74 years old (mean, 49.96 years). Among 67 patients in group A treated with a high-frequency electrosurgical knife under the microscope, 58 were followed up; among 73 patients in group B treated with a traditional cervical hook knife under the microscope, 65 were followed up. Clinical data, operative time, intraoperative bleeding volume, VAS score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) improvement rate were retrospectively analyzed. Results There were significant differences in the mean operative time and intraoperative bleeding volume between the two groups (p \u003C 0.05); however, no significant differences were found in the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, JOA improvement rate at 3 months postoperatively, and VAS score at 3 months postoperatively between the two groups (p \u003E 0.05). Conclusions Electrosurgical resection of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical vertebrae under the microscope can significantly reduce intraoperative bleeding and shorten the operative time and has obvious advantages compared with traditional methods.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaogang; Wang, Guangye; Qin, Yuan-Tian; Li, Jin; Wang, Pu; Huang, Wenjun; Chen, Jie","journal":"Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2019.84827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31908705/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microscope","intraoperative bleeding volume","posterior longitudinal ligament","cervical vertebrae","anterior cervical discectomy","cervical anterior approach","massive bleeding","traditional methods","patients","traditional cervical hook knife","mean operative time","Introduction Anterior cervical decompression","fusion surgery","risk of surgery","high-frequency electrosurgical knife","JOA improvement rate","VAS score","months","significant differences","groups","clinical significance of electrosurgical excision","Conclusions Electrosurgical resection","high-frequency electrotome","Clinical data","group B","years old","Japanese Orthopaedic Association","incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage","obvious advantages","use","hospital","women","Results","Material"],"language":"en"},

MHV infection in mice provides an efficient cause-effect experimental model to understand the mechanisms of direct virus induced neural cell damage leading to demyelination and axonal loss which are pathological features of Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults. Infiltration of T lymphocytes, activation of microglia and their interplay are the primary pathophysiological events leading to the disruption of myelin sheath in MS. However, there are emerging evidences supporting gray matter involvement and degeneration in MS. The investigation of T cell function in the pathogenesis of deep gray matter damage is necessary. Here, we employed RSA59 (isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59) induced experimental neuroinflammation model to compare the disease in CD4-/- mice with CD4\u002B/\u002B mice at days 5, 10, 15, and 30 p.i. Viral titer estimation, nucleocapsid gene amplification and viral anti-nucleocapsid staining confirm enhanced replication of the virions in the absence of functional CD4\u002B T cells in the brain. Histopathological analyses showed an elevated susceptibility of CD4-/- mice to axonal degeneration in the CNS with augmented progression of acute poliomyelitis, and dorsal root ganglionic inflammation rarely observed in CD4\u002B/\u002B mice. Depletion of CD4\u002B T cells shows unique pathological bulbar vacuolation in the brain parenchyma of infected mice with persistent CD11b\u002B microglia/macrophages in the inflamed regions on day 30 p.i. In summary, the current study suggests that CD4\u002B T cells are critical for controlling acute stage poliomyelitis (gray matter inflammation) and chronic axonal degeneration, inflammatory demyelination due to loss of protective anti-viral host immunity.IMPORTANCE The current trend in CNS disease biology is to understand the neural cell-immune interaction to investigate the underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation, rather than focusing on peripheral immune activation. Most studies in MS are targeted towards understanding the involvement of CNS white matter. However, the importance of gray matter damage has become critical in understanding the long-term progressive neurological disorder. Our study highlights the importance of CD4\u002BT cells in safeguarding the neurons against axonal blebbing and poliomyelitis from murine Betacoronavirus-induced neuroinflammation. Current knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to gray matter damage in MS is limited, because the most widely used animal model EAE does not present this aspect of the disease. Our results thus, add to the existing limited knowledge in the field. We also show that the microglia, though important for the initiation of neuroinflammation, cannot establish a protective host immune response without the help of CD4\u002B T cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakravarty, Debanjana; Saadi, Fareeha; Kundu, Soumya; Bose, Abhishek; Khan, Reas; Dine, Kimberly; Kenyon, Lawrence C; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00548-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHV","EAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","importance of CD4","help of CD4","Depletion of CD4","importance of gray matter damage","gray matter inflammation","gray matter involvement","absence of functional CD4","elevated susceptibility of CD4","pathogenesis of deep gray matter damage","involvement of CNS white matter","axonal loss","neural cell damage","investigation of T cell function","Infiltration of T lymphocytes","experimental neuroinflammation model","CNS disease biology","chronic axonal degeneration","axonal blebbing","brain parenchyma of infected mice","activation of microglia","current study","initiation of neuroinflammation","Current knowledge","murine Betacoronavirus-induced neuroinflammation","neural cell-immune interaction","viral anti-nucleocapsid staining","acute stage poliomyelitis","loss of protective anti-viral host immunity","protective host immune response","current trend","MHV infection","common disabling neurological disease","Mouse hepatitis virus","underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation","peripheral immune activation","augmented progression of acute poliomyelitis","Viral titer estimation","mechanisms of direct virus","animal model EAE","existing limited knowledge","efficient cause-effect experimental model","inflammatory demyelination","isogenic recombinant strain of MHV","respiratory diseases","nucleocapsid gene amplification","wide range of diseases","murine \u03B2-coronavirus","unique pathological bulbar vacuolation","dorsal root ganglionic inflammation","pathological features of Multiple sclerosis","long-term progressive neurological disorder","enhanced replication","persistent CD11b","macrophages","virions","enteritis","interplay","young adults","primary pathophysiological events","neurons","inflamed regions","emerging evidences","CoV","RSA59","summary","encephalomyelitis","Histopathological analyses","disruption of myelin sheath","field","aspect","days","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

Even though bioactive meshes loaded with antibiotics or antiseptics are slowly emerging in the market, the available solutions still lack versatility. Here, we proposed a polymer solution, i.e., hyaluronic acid-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (HApN), which forms a hydrogel to be used as coating for meshes only when it reaches body temperature. METHODS We assessed how the gelation of HApN was influenced by the incorporation of different antibiotic and antiseptic formulations, and how this gel can be used to coat several mesh types. The impact of the coating on the elastic behavior of a macroporous mesh was tested under cyclic elongation condition. Finally, we selected two different coating formulations, one based on antibiotics (gentamicin \u002B rifampicin) and one based on antiseptic (chlorhexidine) and tested in vitro their antimicrobial efficacies. RESULTS HApN can be used as carrier for different antimicrobial agents, without having a strong influence on its gelation behavior. Porous or dense meshes can be coated with this polymer, even though the stability was not optimal on macroporous meshes such as Optilene when pores are too large. HApN loaded with drugs inhibited in vitro the growth of several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Causes are multifactorial, with the size of the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler a modifiable factor and potential target for risk reduction. Our goal was to examine the impact of the EEA stapler size on the risk of anastomotic complications in left-sided colorectal resections. METHODS A prospective divisional database was reviewed for consecutive elective left-sided resections with a colorectal anastomosis using an EEA stapler from January 2013 May 2018 inclusive. Patients were stratified into 25-29 mm or 30-33 mm cohorts. Patient and disease demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The main outcome measures were the rate and factors associated with anastomotic complications. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-three cases were evaluated, 185 ( 39.1%) were in the 25-29 mm group and 288 (60.9%) in the 30-33 mm group. Patients were comparable in demographics and operative variables. More males were anastomosed with the 30-33 mm than with the 25-29 mm stapler (57.6% vs 28.6%, p \u003C 0.01). Significantly more patients developed an anastomotic stricture with the 25-29 mm than with the 30-33 mm staplers (7.1% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.007). There was no significant difference in leak rates or reoperation/interventions between groups. On logistic regression, neither gender, operative indication nor approach were associated with anastomotic leak, readmission, or reoperation/intervention. Stapler size remained significantly associated with stricture (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS The 25-29 mm EEA staplers were associated with an increased rate of anastomotic stricture compared to 30-33 mm staplers in left-sided colorectal anastomoses. As stapler size is a simple process measure that is easily modifyable, this is a potential target for improving anastomotic complication rates. Further controlled trials may help assess the impact of stapler size on improving patient and quality outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reif de Paula, T; Simon, H; Shah, M; Lee-Kong, S; Kiely, J M; Kiran, R P; Keller, D S","journal":"Techniques in coloproctology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02155-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32036461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EEA stapler size","impact of stapler size","anastomotic leak","risk of anastomotic complications","BACKGROUND Colorectal anastomotic complications","EEA staplers","anastomotic complication rates","increased rate of anastomotic stricture","colorectal anastomosis","left-sided colorectal resections","Patients","left-sided colorectal anastomoses","operative variables","sided resections","potential target","operative indication","reoperation","leak rates","postoperative outcomes","quality outcomes","risk reduction","end-to-end anastomosis","disease demographics","modifiable factor","consecutive elective","gender","simple process measure","approach","factors","prospective divisional database","interventions","significant difference","readmission","main outcome measures","logistic regression","METHODS","groups","controlled trials","Causes","vs","RESULTS","cases","goal","CONCLUSIONS","cohorts","males"],"language":"en"},

Many of the roles that staff are being allocated to in the intensive care unit and emergency department pose additional risks to themselves, and new policies for staff reallocation are causing distress and uncertainty to the professionals concerned. In this paper, we analyse a range of ethical issues associated with changes to staff allocation processes in the face of COVID-19. In line with a dominant view in the medical ethics literature, we claim, first, that no individual health professional has a specific, positive obligation to treat a patient when doing so places that professional at risk of harm, and so there is a clear ethical tension in any reallocation process in this context. Next, we argue that the changing asymmetries of health needs in hospitals means that careful consideration needs to be given to a stepwise process for deallocating staff from their usual duties. We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are \u0027fit for reallocation\u0027 have been identified. We claim that this process needs to attend to three questions that we consider in detail: (1) how the choice to make reallocation decisions is made, (2) what justifiable models for reallocation might look like and (3) what is owed to those who are reallocated.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunn, Michael; Sheehan, Mark; Hordern, Joshua; Turnham, Helen Lynne; Wilkinson, Dominic","journal":"Journal of medical ethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409625/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["staff reallocation","reallocation process","health professionals","health providers","reallocation decisions","individual health professional","deallocating staff","changing asymmetries of health needs","justifiable process of reallocating professionals","stepwise process","health service delivery","care pathways","staff allocation processes","justifiable models","intensive care unit","critical care settings","staffing models","face of COVID","range of ethical issues","high-risk clinical roles","clear ethical tension","additional risks","emergency department","changes","hospitals","pandemic impacts","dominant view","new policies","distress","positive obligation","medical ethics literature","uncertainty","careful consideration","usual duties","patient","line","risk of harm","choice","context","paper","questions"],"language":"en"},

However, CNOP is known to be a heterogeneous group of orofacial pain disorders, which can lead to different responses to iMCS. Therefore, this paper investigated (1) whether the effectiveness of iMCS is significantly different among different CNOP disorders and (2) whether other confounding factors can be impacting iMCS results in CNOP. A systematic review and meta-analysis using a linear mixed-model was performed. Twenty-three papers were included, totaling 140 CNOP patients. Heterogeneity of the studies showed to be 55.8%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) measured median pain relief of 66.5% (ranging from 0-100%) was found. Linear mixed-model analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia responded significantly more favorable to iMCS than patients suffering from dysfunctional pain syndromes (p = 0.030). Also, patients suffering from CNOP caused by (supra)nuclear lesions responded marginally significantly better to iMCS than patients suffering from CNOP due to trigeminal nerve lesions (p = 0.049). No other confounding factors were elucidated.

No consensus exists on optimal surgical treatment, even if several techniques have been proposed. In this preliminary case-control study we compared excision by knife and diathermy to investigate if wound dehiscence could be related to heat spreading during excision of the sinus. Materials and method Between January 2017 and February 2018, 29 patients underwent to sinus excision.16 patients underwent sinus excision by diathermy (named \u0022Hot\u0022 group, case-group) while 13 patients underwent excision by the knife as the control group (named \u0022Cold\u0022 group). The temperature data were recorded for both groups. Were considered primary and secondary outcomes. Results the cold group has worse outcomes in operative time and blood loss, but better results in post-operative pain at first day and first control, number of weekly and total dressings until healing, time for full wound recovery, days to return to work, patient feeling feedback and scar aspect. Wounds healed within 8-12 days were 84.6% in the Cold group and 18.8% in the Hot one. I\u00B0 Dindo-Clavien complications were respectively 15.4% and 100.0% for the Cold and Hot group. No differences were recorded for II\u00B0 Dindo-Clavien complications and in days of hospitalization. Conclusion cold excision of the sinus pilonidalis has better results both in terms of precarious healing and quality of life, probably because the tissues are not subjected to diathermocoagulation damage and therefore the healing occurs more quickly.

The extremely low incidence of pituitary germinoma has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge regarding its demographics, management, and treatment outcomes. We present the largest multicenter analysis of pituitary germinomas to date, focused on analyzing demographic and management patterns. METHODS This study utilizes the National Cancer Institute\u0027s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program (2004-2016) to study patients with a primary intracranial germinoma of the pituitary gland. We analyzed demographic information and management strategies among adult and pediatric populations and conducted a 20-year overall survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curve for a descriptive evaluation of survival outcomes between age groups and treatment groups. RESULTS 92 patients were included in the study, consisting of 58% pediatric patients and 42% adults, with overall 60% males. 82% patients received radiation as part of the treatment, with no significant difference between pediatric and adult groups. Chemotherapy was used significantly more in pediatrics (p = 0.0002) while surgery was significantly more common in adults (p = 0.0117). The most common treatment in pediatrics was radiation \u002B chemotherapy (47%), while the most common treatment in adults was radiation \u002B gross total resection \u002B chemotherapy (23%) followed by radiation \u002B gross total resection (19%). Younger age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were associated with increased 20-year survival on Kaplan-Meier curves. CONCLUSIONS There exist significant differences in the management of pediatric and adult populations with pituitary germinomas.

Signals may be influenced by anesthetics when patients receive general anesthesia (GA). This study determined the inhibitory concentration of propofol on MER signals when it was coadministered with dexmedetomidine. METHODS Patients were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine (0.5 \u00B5g\u00B7kg loading, followed by infusion at 0.4 \u00B5g\u00B7kg\u00B7h) and propofol through target-controlled infusion for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The surgeon conducted the online scoring of the background signals, spiking frequency, amplitude, and pattern of single-unit activities by using a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale (NRS; 0, maximal suppression; 10, minimal suppression), and responses were grouped into suppression (NRS \u2264 6) and nonsuppression (NRS \u003E 6). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of propofol (as target effect-site concentrations: Ceprop) was determined using modified Dixon\u0027s up-and-down method (UDM). Probit regression analysis was further used to obtain the dose-response relationship, and IC05 and IC95 were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-three adult patients participated in this study. Under the concomitant infusion of dexmedetomidine, the predicted IC50 value (95% confidence interval; CI) of Ceprop for neuronal suppression during MER was 1.29 (1.24-1.34) \u00B5g\u00B7mL as calculated using modified Dixon\u0027s UDM. Using probit analysis, the estimated IC05, IC50, and IC95 values (95% CIs) were 1.17 (0.87-1.23), 1.28 (1.21-1.34), and 1.40 (1.33-1.85) \u00B5g\u00B7mL, respectively. CONCLUSION Our data provided reference values of propofol for dosage adjustment to avoid interference on MER under GA when anesthetics have to be continuously infused during recording.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yu-Shan; Liu, Kang-Du; Chang, Chi; Yang, Huai-Zhe; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Chu, Ya-Chun","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31972830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dixon"],"organizations":["MER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5g","MER signals","NRS","inhibitory concentration of propofol","background signals","maximal suppression","minimal suppression","neuronal suppression","reference values of propofol","target-controlled infusion","concomitant infusion of dexmedetomidine","Ceprop","target refinement","general anesthesia","IC95 values","modified Dixon\u0027s UDM","anesthetics","adult patients","GA","probit analysis","METHODS Patients","study","predicted IC50 value","median inhibitory concentration","BACKGROUND Microelectrode recording","Probit regression analysis","target effect-site concentrations","estimated IC05","modified Dixon\u0027s up-and-down method","amplitude","dosage adjustment","deep brain stimulator insertion","interference","spiking frequency","confidence interval","pattern of single","Parkinson disease","online scoring","tracheal intubation","verbal numerical rating scale","data","responses","dose-response relationship","unit activities","CONCLUSION","loading","surgeon","RESULTS","CIs","nonsuppression"],"language":"en"},

Despite advances in therapeutic interventions, survival rates amongst HNSCC patients have remained static for years. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor initiating cells that are highly resistant to treatment, and are hypothesized to contribute to a significant fraction of tumor recurrences. Consequently, further investigations of how CSCs mediate recurrence may provide insights into novel druggable targets. A key element of recurrence involves the tumor\u0027s ability to evade immunosurveillance. Recent published reports suggest that CSCs possess immunosuppressive properties, however, the underlying mechanism have yet to be fully elucidated. To date, most groups have focused on the role of CSC-derived secretory proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors. Here, we review the established immunoregulatory role of exosomes derived from mixed tumor cell populations, and propose further study of CSC-derived exosomes may be warranted. Such studies may yield novel insights into new druggable targets, or lay the foundation for future exosome-based diagnostics.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clayton, Shannon M; Archard, Joehleen; Wagner, Joseph; Farwell, D Gregory; Bewley, Arnaud F; Beliveau, Angela; Birkeland, Andrew C; Rao, Shyam; Abouyared, Marianne; Belafsky, Peter; Anderson, Johnathon D","journal":"Stem cells and development","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2019.0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31856674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CSCs","derived exosomes","tumor initiating cells","novel insights","novel druggable targets","role of CSC","mixed tumor cell populations","new druggable targets","derived secretory proteins","established immunoregulatory role of exosomes","study of CSC","significant fraction of tumor recurrences","Cancer stem cells","key element of recurrence","neck squamous cell carcinomas","HNSCC patients","survival rates","foundation","therapeutic interventions","mucosal lining","malignancies","HNSCCs","cytokines","immunosuppressive properties","tumor\u0027s ability","upper aerodigestive tract","future exosome-based diagnostics","advances","Head","Recent published reports","underlying mechanism","years","studies","growth factors","immunosurveillance","groups","treatment","investigations","date"],"language":"en"},

The reason is that the abnormal tumor microenvironment prevents nanoparticles from effective concentrating and reaching tumor area. Therefore, it\u0027s very necessary to better understand the effect of the abnormal tumor microenvironment on the transvascular transport of nanoparticles to overcome this critical problem. METHODS In this paper, a tumor abnormal vascular-interstitial model was established, and the transvascular transport process of nanoparticles was simulated in the model by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. RESULTS The simulation results showed that the transport efficiency of nanoparticles decreased with increasing interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), and nanoparticles could not cross the blood vessel wall when the IFP approached the blood vessel wall pressure. Interestingly, the transport efficiency of nanoparticles first increased with blood flow velocity, and then decreased with blood flow velocity. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that with the continuous malignant development of tumors, the ability of nanoparticles to passively diffuse has almost disappeared. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of the nanoparticles disappeared with the disappearance of the pressure gradient inside the tumor. These results provided guidance for future research on the vascular transport pathways and mechanisms of nanoparticles.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Yan; Shi, Yanbin; Fu, Mengguang; Feng, Yihua; Lin, Guimei; Kong, Deyin; Jiang, Bo","journal":"Computer methods and programs in biomedicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transport efficiency of nanoparticles","transvascular transport of nanoparticles","ability of nanoparticles","mechanisms of nanoparticles","transvascular transport process of nanoparticles","abnormal tumor microenvironment","tumor area","tumor abnormal vascular-interstitial model","blood vessel wall pressure","vascular transport pathways","blood flow velocity","simulation results","IFP","nanoparticle preparations","increasing interstitial fluid pressure","pressure gradient","desired therapeutic effect","treatment of tumors","computational fluid dynamics","continuous malignant development of tumors","great potential","future research","OBJECTIVE","CFD","EPR","modeling","retention","guidance","paper","enhanced permeability","BACKGROUND","disappearance","reason","critical problem","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Not all studies have observed such relationships, however. Differences in study outcomes may be due to methodological limitations and the presence of confounding factors within studies such as immigration status and level of education. We conducted the first systematic review with meta-analysis combining cross-sectional studies to explore if bilingualism might delay symptom onset and diagnosis of dementia, AD, and MCI. Primary outcomes included the age of symptom onset, the age at diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and the risk of developing MCI or dementia. A secondary outcome included the degree of disease severity at dementia diagnosis. There was no difference in the age of MCI diagnosis between monolinguals and bilinguals [mean difference: 3.2; 95% confidence intervals (CI): -3.4, 9.7]. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals reported experiencing AD symptoms 4.7 years (95% CI: 3.3, 6.1) later. Bilinguals vs. monolinguals were diagnosed with dementia 3.3 years (95% CI: 1.7, 4.9) later. Here, 95% prediction intervals showed a large dispersion of effect sizes (-1.9 to 8.5). We investigated this dispersion with a subgroup meta-analysis comparing studies that had recruited participants with dementia to studies that had recruited participants with AD on the age of dementia and AD diagnosis between mono- and bilinguals. Results showed that bilinguals vs. monolinguals were 1.9 years (95% CI: -0.9, 4.7) and 4.2 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.4) older than monolinguals at the time of dementia and AD diagnosis, respectively. The mean difference between the two subgroups was not significant. There was no significant risk reduction (odds ratio: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68-1.16) in developing dementia among bilinguals vs. monolinguals. Also, there was no significant difference (Hedges\u0027 g = 0.05; 95% CI: -0.13, 0.24) in disease severity at dementia diagnosis between bilinguals and monolinguals, despite bilinguals being significantly older. The majority of studies had adjusted for level of education suggesting that education might not have played a role in the observed delay in dementia among bilinguals vs. monolinguals. Although findings indicated that bilingualism was on average related to a delayed onset of dementia, the magnitude of this relationship varied across different settings. This variation may be due to unexplained heterogeneity and different sources of bias in the included studies.

A retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 to February 2019. A total of 44 patients and 52 nodules (mean tumor size, 17.2\u00B14.9 mm) were treated with MWA, and 55 patients and 70 nodules (mean tumor size, 17.7\u00B16.4 mm) were treated with RFA. After 4 days of treatment, the direct effects of ablation were assessed using dynamic CT, and after discharge, a follow-up dynamic CT scan was performed every 3-4 months. Treatment efficacy, complications and local recurrence were recorded. For MWA and RFA, the average number of CT sessions were 1.05\u00B10.23 and 1.28\u00B10.54, respectively, and the mean ablation times were 5.0\u00B12.0 and 8.1\u00B14.8 min.

The rates of complete tumor necrosis were comparable. The complication rates were 13.6% (MWA) and 14.5% (RFA), which were not significantly different. The cumulative local recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two methods (one-year recurrence rate, MWA: 6.91%, RFA: 5.17%).

We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020). RESULTS In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85).

INTERPRETATION Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity. Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00FCni, Peter; Rothenb\u00FChler, Martina; Bobos, Pavlos; Thorpe, Kevin E; da Costa, Bruno R; Fisman, David N; Slutsky, Arthur S; Gesink, Dionne","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRR"],"locations":["China","South Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["RRR","associations of epidemic growth","public health interventions","absolute humidity","INTERPRETATION Epidemic growth of COVID","reduced epidemic growth","relative humidity","school closures","temperature","latitude","cases","cumulative counts of COVID","Strong associations","restrictions of mass gatherings","measures of social distancing","weak negative associations","ratios of rate ratios","local transmission","transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","current coronavirus disease","seasonal changes","slowdown","prospective cohort study","number","climate","geopolitical areas","exposure period","South Korea","Iran","China","SARS-CoV","trend","weighted random-effects regression","Italy","METHODS","BACKGROUND","days","m3","multivariable model","confidence interval","RESULTS","univariate analyses","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS Risk assessment tools can assist surgeons and other healthcare providers in identifying the benefit-risk ratio of surgical candidates. These tools gather demographic, medical history, and other pertinent patient-reported measures to calculate a probability utilizing regression or machine learning statistical foundations. Currently, much is still unknown about the use of these tools to predict quality of life, disability, and other factors following spine surgery. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines that identified risk assessment tools that utilized patient-reported outcome measures as part of the calculation. From 8128 identified studies, 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were accepted into this review. The range of c-index values reported in the studies was between 0.63 and 0.84, indicating fair to excellent model performance. Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes were identified in the following categories (n = total number of predictive models): return to work (n = 3), pain (n = 9), physical functioning and disability (n = 5), quality of life (QOL) (n = 6), and psychosocial disposition (n = 2).

We present a potentially universal platform for generating soluble antigens from bacterial hosts, tailored to immunized animals for Ab production. A novel RNA-dependent chaperone, in which the target antigen is genetically fused with an RNA-interacting domain (RID) docking tag derived from the immunized host, promotes the solubility and robust folding of the target antigen. We selected the N-terminal tRNA-binding domain of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) as the RID for fusion with viral proteins and demonstrated the expression of the RID fusion proteins in their soluble and native conformations; immunization predominantly elicited Ab responses to the target antigen, whereas the \u0022self\u0022 RID tag remained non-immunogenic. Differential immunogenicity of the fusion proteins greatly enriched and simplified the screening of hybridoma clones of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), enabling specific and sensitive serodiagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Moreover, mAbs against the consensus influenza hemagglutinin stalk domain enabled a novel assay for trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines. The Fc-mediated effector function was demonstrated, which could be harnessed for the design of next-generation \u0022universal\u0022 influenza vaccines.

At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently the COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on intellectual disability such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an intellectual disability. METHODS From CORD-19 we identified full text articles containing terms related to the intellectual disability-care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the TF-IDF analysis in combination with K-means clustering. RESULTS 259 articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to intellectual disability. We were able to cluster these articles related to intellectual disabilities into five clusters on different topics, namely: Mental health, Viral diseases, Diagnoses \u0026 Treatments, Maternal care \u0026 Pediatrics, and Genetics. CONCLUSION The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also intellectual disabilities and the relationship between them.

Recently, the combination of three known drugs, lopinavir, oseltamivir and ritonavir has been proposed to control the virulence to a great extent in COVID-19 affected patients within 48 hours. Hence, we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 protease using sequential docking studies. As a result, combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs. Further, the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex, considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein. The protein complexed with three drugs remained stable during the simulations. Hence, these drugs can be explored further for drug repurposing against the successful inhibition of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muralidharan, Nisha; Sakthivel, R; Velmurugan, D; Gromiha, M Michael","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1752802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["known drugs","individual drugs","concept of drug repurposing","drug repurposing concept","SARS-CoV","complex","combination","known diseases","protein","successful inhibition of COVID","novel coronavirus","coronavirus disease","infectious diseases","molecular dynamics simulations","insights","protease","lopinavir","better binding energy","affected patients","great extent","series","oseltamivir","emergency","urgency","sequential docking studies","simultaneous interactions","humans","world","latest pandemic","virulence","stability","ritonavir","major outbreak","effect of synergism","hours","years","result"],"language":"en"},

This modification can have a wide variety of effects on proteins including alteration of enzyme activity, protein-protein interactions, and protein stability. Several PARPs are induced by interferon (IFN) and are known to have antiviral properties, implicating ADP-ribosylation in the host defense response and suggesting that viral macrodomains may counter this response. Recent studies have demonstrated that viral macrodomains do counter the innate immune response by interfering with PARP-mediated antiviral defenses, stress granule formation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

However, in many countries a \u0022Phase-2\u0022 is approaching and many activities will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10. Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria; Miani, Alessandro","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17092986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Harvard School of Public Health"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["particulate matter concentration","high concentrations of particulate matter","dramatic impact of COVID","particulate matter of Bergamo","possible relapses","SARS-COV","possible link","Italian epidemic","presence of SARS","possible strategies","potential early indicator of COVID","RNA","availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses","outbreak progression","public health purposes","severity","Northern Italy","Harvard School of Public Health","high PM concentrations","terms of negative health outcomes","future epidemics","PM10 of outdoor air samples","estimated diffusion","Italian Society of Environmental Medicine","suspension of entire national economic systems","increases","strong association","serious social challenges","effective vaccines","mortality rates","related quarantines","immunoprophylaxis","SIMA","world","remarkable consequences","necessary preventive measures","human recombinant antibodies","case of atmospheric stability","decision makers","extreme measure","experimental finding","city","virus","pandemic","infection","time","well-known specific climatic conditions","people","risk","Position Paper","general population","total shutdown","epicenter","viral genome","PM2","months of quarantine","activities","sacrifices","clusters","particles","area","COVD","differences","number of nations","countries","Phase","Milan","assumptions","survey"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in health care workers. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from January 1st 2014 to March 9th 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1st 1990 to December 9th 2014. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in health care workers. DATA EXTRACTION Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS Four RCTs were meta-analysed adjusting for clustering. Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I2 =0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28; I2 =78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49). LIMITATIONS Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. CONCLUSIONS Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health care workers during non-aerosol generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartoszko, Jessica J; Farooqi, Mohammed Abdul Malik; Alhazzani, Waleed; Loeb, Mark","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STUDY SELECTION Randomized"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care workers","viral respiratory infection","Preservation of N95 respirators","viral infection","CONCLUSIONS Low certainty evidence","use of medical masks","epidemiological data","DATA SYNTHESIS","protective effect of medical masks","clinical respiratory illness","DATA SOURCES MEDLINE","imprecision of available evidence","BACKGROUND Respiratory protective devices","RCTs","coronavirus disease","laboratory","DATA EXTRACTION Reviewer pair","COVID","coronaviruses","I2","non-aerosol","risk of bias","high risk of novel","similar protection","meta-analysed adjusting","STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials","relative effectiveness","clustering","Embase","LIMITATIONS Indirectness","procedures","difference","pandemic","recommendations","PURPOSE","Update of published search","groups","short supply"],"language":"en"},

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) is an RNase decreasing stability of transcripts coding for inflammation-related proteins. In addition, MCPIP1 plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis in vitro by reducing the expression of key transcription factors, including C/EBP\u03B2. To elucidate the role of MCPIP1 in adipocyte biology, we performed RNA-Seq and proteome analysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing wild-type (WTMCPIP1) and the mutant form of MCPIP1 protein (D141NMCPIP1). Our RNA-Seq analysis followed by confirmatory Q-RT-PCR revealed that elevated MCPIP1 levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upregulated transcripts encoding proteins involved in signal transmission and cellular remodeling and downregulated transcripts of factors involved in metabolism. These data are consistent with our proteomic analysis, which showed that MCPIP1 expressing adipocytes exhibit upregulation of proteins involved in cellular organization and movement and decreased levels of proteins involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, MCPIP1 adipocytes are characterized by decreased level of insulin receptor, reduced insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, as well as depleted Glut4 level and impaired glucose uptake. Overexpression of Glut4 in 3T3-L1 cells expressed WTMCPIP1 rescued adipogenesis. Interestingly, we found decreased level of MCPIP1 along with an increase in body mass index in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The presented data show a novel role of MCPIP1 in modulating insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that MCPIP1 is an important regulator of adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Losko, Magdalena; Dolicka, Dobrochna; Pydyn, Natalia; Jankowska, Urszula; Kedracka-Krok, Sylwia; Kulecka, Maria; Paziewska, Agnieszka; Mikula, Michal; Major, Piotr; Winiarski, Marek; Budzynski, Andrzej; Jura, Jolanta","journal":"Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03434-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31893310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MCPIP1 adipocytes","decreased level of MCPIP1","novel role of MCPIP1","elevated MCPIP1 levels","mutant form of MCPIP1 protein","3T3-L1 adipocytes upregulated transcripts","decreased levels of proteins","adipocytes exhibit upregulation of proteins","important role","induced protein","adipocyte metabolism","3T3-L1 cells","level of insulin receptor","RNA-Seq analysis","downregulated transcripts of factors","inflammation-related proteins","depleted Glut4 level","proteome analysis","important regulator of adipogenesis","proteomic analysis","WTMCPIP1 rescued adipogenesis","regulation of adipogenesis","carbohydrate metabolism","stability of transcripts coding","modulating insulin sensitivity","Monocyte chemoattractant protein","reduced insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation","cellular remodeling","cellular organization","wild-type","Overexpression of Glut4","adipocyte biology","presented data","serious chronic disease","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","expression of key transcription factors","cardiovascular diseases","signal transmission","body mass index","PCR","movement","confirmatory Q-RT","subcutaneous adipose tissue","increased risk","impaired glucose uptake","lipid","diabetes","D141NMCPIP1","RNase","Obesity","EBP\u03B2","addition","findings"],"language":"en"},

Since healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of acquiring and spreading MERS-CoV, we aimed to evaluate the perceived risk and anxiety level of HCWs in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS. METHODOLOGY An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was sent online to HCWs at King Khalid University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The total knowledge and anxiety scores were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of high anxiety scores. RESULTS Of 591 (70%) HCWs that responded, 284 (55%), 164 (32%), and 68 (13.2%) were physicians, nurses, and technicians, respectively. Physicians obtained a lower median knowledge score (6/9) compared to other professions (7/9). The mean anxiety score was similar for physicians and other HCWs (3/5); however, non-physicians expressed higher levels of anxiety toward the risk of transmitting MERS-CoV to their families, with an anxiety score of 4/5. The ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death was the most frequently reported reason for worry by physicians (89.7%) and non-physicians (87.2%). Overall, 80% of physicians and 90% of non-physicians reported improvement in adherence to hand hygiene and standard precautions while in hospital (p = 0.002). Concern over transmitting MERS-CoV to family members was the most predictive factor for anxiety among non-physician HCWs. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of HCWs expressed anxiety about the risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection. Healthcare institutions need to develop an integrated psychological response for HCWs to the occupational and psychological challenge of MERS-CoV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsubaie, Sarah; Hani Temsah, Mohamad; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A; Gossady, Ibrahim; Hasan, Gamal M; Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Jamal, Amr A; Alhaboob, Ali An; Alsohime, Fahad; Somily, Ali M","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.11753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","King Khalid University Hospital","Healthcare"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["non-physicians","anxiety level of HCWs","risk of transmitting MERS-CoV","non-physician HCWs","mean anxiety score","risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection","CoV outbreaks","higher levels of anxiety","psychological challenge of MERS","significant proportion of HCWs","Saudi Arabia","higher risk","predictors of high anxiety scores","perceived risk","lower median knowledge score","frequent outbreaks","total knowledge","reported reason","Healthcare institutions","healthcare workers","integrated psychological response","King Khalid University Hospital","adherence","predictive factor","INTRODUCTION Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","standard precautions","hand hygiene","family members","death","improvement","families","self-administered questionnaire","hospitals","severe disease","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSION","worry","Concern","Logistic regression analyses","ability","nurses","technicians","RESULTS","professions"],"language":"en"},

A recent study of cardiac surgery patients suggests that physical frailty is a risk factor for both complications. We sought to examine the relationship between preoperative frailty and postoperative delirium and preoperative frailty and POCD after major noncardiac surgery. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of patients \u003E65 years old having major elective noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were preexisting dementia, inability to consent, cardiac, intracranial, or emergency surgery. Preoperative frailty was determined using the FRAIL scale, a simple questionnaire that categorizes patients as robust, prefrail, or frail. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) twice daily, starting in the recovery room until hospital discharge. All patients were assessed with neuropsychological tests (California Verbal Learning Test II, Trail Making Test, subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Logical Memory Story A, Immediate and Delayed Recall, Animal and Vegetable verbal fluency, Boston Naming Test, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination) before surgery and at 3 months afterward. RESULTS A total of 178 patients met inclusion criteria; 167 underwent major surgery and 150 were available for follow-up 3 months after surgery. The median age was 70 years old. Thirty-one patients (18.6%) tested as frail, and 72 (43.1%) prefrail before surgery. After adjustment for baseline cognitive score, age, education, surgery duration, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, type of surgery, and sex, patients who tested frail or prefrail had an estimated 2.7 times the odds of delirium (97.5% confidence interval, 1.0-7.3) when compared to patients who were robust. There was no significant difference between the proportion of POCD between patients who tested as frail, prefrail, or robust. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for baseline cognition, testing as frail or prefrail with the FRAIL scale is associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium, but not POCD after noncardiac surgery.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahanna-Gabrielli, Elizabeth; Zhang, Kathy; Sieber, Frederick E; Lin, Hung Mo; Liu, Xiaoyu; Sewell, Margaret; Deiner, Stacie G; Boockvar, Kenneth S","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCD","Confusion Assessment Method","Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale","Mini-Mental"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major surgery","surgery duration","type of surgery","emergency surgery","major noncardiac surgery","recent study of cardiac surgery patients","FRAIL scale","prefrail","major elective noncardiac surgery","preoperative frailty","odds of delirium","prospective cohort study of patients","physical frailty","increased odds of postoperative delirium","proportion of POCD","baseline cognitive score","physical status","years old","BACKGROUND Postoperative cognitive dysfunction","adjustment","months","California Verbal Learning Test","common perioperative cognitive complications","Boston Naming Test","Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale","baseline cognition","median age","inclusion criteria","Exclusion criteria","Vegetable verbal fluency","Mini-Mental Status Examination","education","Logical Memory Story","Animal","Delayed Recall","intensive care unit","American Society of Anesthesiologists","ASA","subtests","Trail","neuropsychological tests","older adults","Confusion Assessment Method","inability","general anesthesia","simple questionnaire","CAM-ICU","dementia","risk factor","times","follow-up","relationship","sex","recovery room","hospital discharge","METHODS","significant difference","CONCLUSIONS","total","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines can play a key role in preventing harm, but there will inevitably be shortages because there is no possibility of advance stockpiling. We therefore need some method of prioritising access. MAIN TEXT This paper reports a critical interpretative review of the published literature that discusses ethical arguments used to justify how we could prioritise vaccine during an influenza pandemic. We found that the focus of the literature was often on proposing different groups as priorities (e.g. those with pre-existing health conditions, the young, the old, health care workers etc.). Different reasons were often suggested as a means of justifying such priority groupings (e.g. appeal to best overall outcomes, fairness, belonging to a vulnerable or \u0027at risk\u0027 group etc.). We suggest that much of the literature, wrongly, assumes that we are able to plan priority groups prior to the time of a particular pandemic and development of a particular vaccine. We also point out the surprising absence of various issues from the literature (e.g. how vaccines fit within overall pandemic planning, a lack of specificity about place, issues of global justice etc.). CONCLUSIONS The literature proposes a wide range of ways to prioritise vaccines, focusing on different groups and \u0027principles\u0027. Any plan to use pandemic vaccine must provide justifications for its prioritisation. The focus of this review was influenza pandemic vaccines, but lessons can be learnt for future allocations of coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Jane H; Dawson, Angus","journal":"BMC medical ethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-00477-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic vaccines","particular pandemic","published literature","particular vaccine","different groups","overall pandemic planning","priority groups","future allocations of coronavirus vaccine","Different reasons","focus","priority groupings","future pandemics","critical interpretative review","best overall outcomes","pre-existing health conditions","issues of global justice","health care workers","surprising absence of various issues","appeal","lack of specificity","fairness","place","paper","time","lessons","development","wide range of ways","priorities","MAIN TEXT","world","means","key role","ethical arguments","CONCLUSIONS","justifications","possibility of advance stockpiling","method of prioritising access","risk","harm","BACKGROUND","prioritisation","principles\u0027","shortages"],"language":"en"},

All these aspects are developed in this guide, which, like the previous one, will remain open to any necessary revision in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Alfonso, P; Garc\u00EDa-Carbonero, R; Garc\u00EDa-Foncillas, J; P\u00E9rez-Segura, P; Salazar, R; Vera, R; Ram\u00F3n Y Cajal, S; Hern\u00E1ndez-Losa, J; Landolfi, S; Musul\u00E9n, E; Cuatrecasas, M; Navarro, S","journal":"Clinical \u0026 translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02357-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Society of Medical Oncology (Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola de Oncolog\u00EDa","NTRK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular biomarkers of localized CRC","susceptibility markers of hereditary CRC","Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola","analysis of biomarkers","impact of molecular lymph node analysis","lymph node staging","Spanish Society of Pathology","Spanish Society of Medical Oncology","liquid biopsy","NRAS","HER2","amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor","Anatom\u00EDa Patol\u00F3gica-SEAP","Oncolog\u00EDa M\u00E9dica-SEOM","DNA repair pathway","essential determination of KRAS","convenience","advances","advanced colorectal cancer","clinical management of patients","expression of proteins","BRAF mutations","importance","differentiated clusters","generation sequencing","study of NTRK fusions","NGS","consensus","prognostic value","genomic technologies","published information","necessary revision","pathological point of view","incorporation of pan","tumour","guide","future","update","aspects"],"language":"en"},

This paper summarizes the main concurrent pain conditions by analyzing the major interactions observed. In particular, co-occurrence will be examined in: visceral pain (especially ischemic heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, dysmenorrhea/endometriosis and urinary pain), fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain and headache. Two concurrent visceral pains from internal organs sharing at least part of their central sensory projection can give rise to viscero-visceral hyperalgesia, i.e., enhancement of typical pain symptoms from both districts. Visceral pain, headache and musculoskeletal pains (myofascial pain from trigger points, joint pain) can enhance pain and hyperalgesia from fibromyalgia. Myofascial pain from trigger points can perpetuate pain symptoms from visceral pain conditions and trigger migraine attacks when located in the referred pain area from an internal organ or in cervico-facial areas, respectively. The pathophysiology of these pain associations is complex and probably multifactorial; among the possible processes underlying the mutual influence of symptoms recorded in the associations is modulation of central sensitization phenomena by nociceptive inputs from one or the other condition. A strong message in these pain syndrome co-occurrence is that effective treatment of one of the conditions can also improve symptoms from the other, thus suggesting a systematic and thorough evaluation of the pain patient for a global effective management of his/her suffering.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Affaitati, Giannapia; Costantini, Raffaele; Tana, Claudio; Cipollone, Francesco; Giamberardino, Maria Adele","journal":"Journal of neural transmission","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-019-02107-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pain associations","myofascial pain","pain patient","urinary pain","joint pain","visceral pain conditions","pain syndrome co-occurrence","referred pain area","main concurrent pain conditions","enhancement of typical pain symptoms","concurrent visceral pains","viscero-visceral hyperalgesia","trigger points","musculoskeletal pains","mutual influence of symptoms","headache","fibromyalgia","trigger migraine attacks","internal organs","effective treatment","irritable bowel syndrome","global effective management","central sensory projection","modulation of central sensitization phenomena","ischemic heart disease","dysmenorrhea","endometriosis","rise","nociceptive inputs","possible processes","thorough evaluation","strong message","paper","cervico-facial areas","major interactions","clinical expressions","various ways","pathophysiology","districts","suffering","patients"],"language":"en"},

However, it often decreases the spatial resolution. The ability of high spatial resolution kernels (harder kernels) to compensate for the decrease in the spatial resolution of hybrid IRs was investigated. METHODS An elliptic cylindrical phantom simulating an adult abdomen was used. Two types of rod-shaped objects with ~330 and ~130 HU were inserted to simulate contrasts of arteries in CT angiography. Two multi-slice CT systems were used to scan the phantoms with 120 kVp and scan doses of 20 and 10 mGy. The task transfer functions (TTFs) were measured from the circular edges of the rod images. The noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured from the images of the water-only section. The CT images were reconstructed using a filtered back projection (FBP) with baseline kernels and two levels of hybrid IRs with harder kernels. The profiles of the clinical images across the aortic dissection flaps were measured to evaluate actual spatial resolutions. RESULTS The TTF degradation of each hybrid IR was recovered by the harder kernels, whereas the noise reduction effect was retained, for both the 20 and 10 mGy. The profiles of the dissection flaps for the FBP were maintained by using the harder kernels. Even with the best combination of hybrid IR and harder kernel, the noise level at 10 mGy was not reduced to the level of FBP at 20 mGy, suggesting no capability of a 50% dose reduction while maintaining noise.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sugisawa, Koichi; Ichikawa, Katsuhiro; Urikura, Atsushi; Minamishima, Kazuya; Masuda, Shota; Hoshino, Takashi; Nakahara, Akiko; Yamada, Yoshitake; Jinzaki, Masahiro","journal":"Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["HU"],"organizations":["IRs","CT","TTF","FBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harder kernels","CT images","mGy","baseline kernels","spatial resolution of hybrid IRs","noise level","ability of high spatial resolution kernels","clinical images","rod images","levels of hybrid IRs","noise reduction effect","best combination of hybrid IR","level of FBP","CT angiography","noise power spectrum","PURPOSE Hybrid iterative reconstruction","actual spatial resolutions","profiles","multi-slice CT systems","aortic dissection flaps","dose reduction","scan doses","elliptic cylindrical phantom","computed tomography","TTFs","adult abdomen","phantoms","projection","NPS","decrease","contrasts of arteries","circular edges","task transfer functions","METHODS","kVp","capability","TTF degradation","types of rod-shaped objects","water","HU"],"language":"en"},

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here we provide an overview of the known clinical features of and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: \u0027COVID-19\u0027, \u00272019-nCoV\u0027, \u0027coronavirus\u0027 and \u0027SARS-CoV-2\u0027. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pascarella, Giuseppe; Strumia, Alessandro; Piliego, Chiara; Bruno, Federica; Del Buono, Romualdo; Costa, Fabio; Scarlata, Simone; Agr\u00F2, Felice Eugenio","journal":"Journal of internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Google Scholar"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","main symptoms of COVID","novel coronavirus","effective treatment","main therapies","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","respiratory therapy","treatment options","human","known clinical features","main online databases","randomized clinical trials","appropriate evidence-based treatment modality","tracheal aspirate","headache","Google Scholar","sore throat","slight dyspnoea","nasal swab","diagnostic tool","UpToDate","MEDLINE","fatigue","PubMed","Web of Science","conjunctivitis","Embase","bronchoalveolar lavage samples","hydroxychloroquine","contact","cough","fever","family","systematic literature search","antiviral drugs","diagnosis","personal protective equipment","Computed tomography findings","contaminated environmental surfaces","specific environments","gastrointestinal issues","following keywords","World Health Organization","pandemic","Hand hygiene","contamination","overview","Real-time PCR","high-risk individuals","follow-up","quarantine","intervention","contagion rate","infection","treatments","flu","conclusion","nCoV","publications"],"language":"en"},

Serum and urinary AIM levels in the patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results were compared with clinical features. RESULTS In patients with IgAN and HSPN, AIM expression was observed in various areas, including the glomerular mesangial and capillary areas, the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells, and on infiltrating macrophages in the glomeruli and interstitial areas. Serum and urinary AIM levels were significantly elevated in these patients compared with the HCs. Urinary AIM levels were positively correlated with the histological severity and degree of proteinuria and hematuria as well as urinary \u03B22 microglobulin and urinary N-acetyl-\u03B2-D-glucosaminidase levels. CONCLUSIONS AIM plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN. Urinary AIM levels can potentially reflect active renal inflammation in these diseases and may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity. IMPACT Urinary AIM levels may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity of IgAN and HSPN.AIM expression was observed in the glomeruli, tubular epithelial cells, and infiltrating macrophages in glomeruli and interstitial area.U-AIM/Cr were significantly correlated not only with proteinuria, hematuria, and u-\u03B22MG and u-NAG levels but also with the activity index of histological findings in kidney biopsy specimens.Our results can emphasize the important role of AIM in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Irabu, Hitoshi; Shimizu, Masaki; Kaneko, Shuya; Inoue, Natsumi; Mizuta, Mao; Tasaki, Yuko; Ohta, Kazuhide; Yachie, Akihiro; Wada, Taizo","journal":"Pediatric research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0951-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSPN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["U-AIM","IMPACT Urinary AIM levels","AIM expression","CONCLUSIONS AIM","important role of AIM","patients","HSPN","glucosaminidase levels","disease activity of IgAN","u-NAG levels","pathogenesis of IgAN","urinary N-acetyl","urinary \u03B22 microglobulin","glomeruli","results","interstitial areas","infiltrating macrophages","useful biomarker","activity index of histological findings","capillary areas","various areas","u-\u03B22MG","hematuria","clinical usefulness of serum","HCs","distal tubular epithelial cells","kidneys of children","histological severity","degree of proteinuria","clinical features","kidney biopsy specimens","deposition patterns","\u03B2-D","Henoch-Sch\u00F6nlein purpura nephritis","diseases","IgA nephropathy","active renal inflammation","apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage","biomarkers","healthy controls","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","METHODS Immunohistochemical study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the medical costs associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations caused by RSV infection among infants aged \u003C 2 years in Colombia. METHODS This was a prevalence-based cost-of-illness multicentric study performed from the societal perspective during 2016-2017. A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection with hospitalization. All costs and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices and health records. RESULTS This study included 193 patients with a diagnosis of RSV. The average hospital stay duration was 5.55 days. The major contributors to hospitalization costs were room costs (31.5%), drugs (21.8%), and indirect costs (14.9%). Medications with the highest costs were nebulization with a hypertonic solution and systemic antibiotics. In total, 96% of \u03B2-lactam antibiotics, 90% of bronchodilators, and 86% of corticosteroids and epinephrine were classified as inappropriate. CONCLUSION RSV infection in Colombia places a high economic burden on the health system. Generating comprehensive data on healthcare resource use and costs associated with RSV will help to provide valuable information for the development of cost-effectiveness models and to guide RSV-prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buend\u00EDa, Jefferson Antonio; Pati\u00F1o, Diana Guerrero","journal":"PharmacoEconomics - open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41669-020-00218-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Colombia"],"keyphrases":["medical costs","hospitalization costs","CONCLUSION RSV infection","diagnosis of RSV","room costs","highest costs","indirect costs","RSV-prevention strategies","medical tests","medical invoices","healthcare resource use","illness multicentric study","Colombia places","overuse of medications","health system","systemic antibiotics","health records","\u03B2-lactam antibiotics","high economic burden","nebulization","management of respiratory syncytial virus","insufficient evidence of effectiveness","hypertonic solution","bronchiolitis hospitalizations","infants","development of cost-effectiveness models","valuable information","comprehensive data","clinical practice guidelines","prevalence-based cost","major contributors","laboratory","societal perspective","corticosteroids","average hospital","duration","days","BACKGROUND","bronchodilators","years","patients","resources","epinephrine","METHODS","total","case","OBJECTIVE","drugs"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. PARTICIPANTS 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. RESULTS The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37% (618/1658) died, and 46% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital. CONCLUSIONS ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report.

Should he opt out of the care of these patients or does his duty to care override other considerations? SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Older adults and those with serious medical conditions are at much greater risk for severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection. As a practicing frontline surgeon in a high risk group, the hospital offered the author, and other health care providers at high risk, the option to opt out of the care Covid-19 suspected or infected patients before an anticipated surge. What should the surgeon and other health care providers do? This is a question many are asking and having to answer. METHODS In this article, the author describes how difficult the situation of having any choice at all was and then how difficult it was to arrive at a decision. The duty to care and its limits, as well as obligations to society, family, co-workers, and to self, are examined. The author considers how he and others can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. CONCLUSION The author arrives at a morally permissible and a rational decision to opt out. Health care workers at high risk can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. It still may not feel right.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanto, Douglas W","journal":"Annals of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care Covid","health care providers","author","Health care workers","high risk group","greater risk","practicing surgeon","infected patients","practicing frontline surgeon","ways","duty","infection","rational decision","death","serious medical conditions","SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Older adults","severe disease","mortality","family","co-workers","obligations","study","conflicting duties","morbidity","hospital","option","anticipated surge","society","situation","article","OBJECTIVE","aim","self","override","considerations","choice","limits","METHODS","CONCLUSION","question"],"language":"en"},

In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%. This study demonstrates that providing people with assurances for their livelihood during self-quarantine is an important component in compliance with public health regulations.

This progress is particularly marked in cell therapy and in the personalization of therapy based on genetic insight, an approach known as genomic medicine. Our objective is to comment on the progress made in cell and genomic medicine against an historical backcloth of the search for rejuvenation. COMMENT In 1741, close to seven decades after Antoine van Leeuwenhoek first saw his microscopic animalcules, Abraham Trembley, a tutor in Leiden, reported on an organism that could regenerate itself. The strange organism was thought to hold the secret of life. If it does, we have yet to prise the secret out. However, the ensuing study of cell programming and induced stem cells has shed considerable light on cellular development and provided new insights on the rejuvenative capacity of organisms. Inventive scientists have provided a deeper understanding of cell replication and, from this, developed new medicines for an increasing range of diseases. Targeted therapies, oligonucleotide therapy, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and pharmacogenetics are all new therapeutic areas originating from the improved insights. More will surely follow. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Immortality is for the gods, but man\u0027s search for its elusive secrets, perhaps as old as man himself, will continue. Huge leaps have been made, and effective medicines have been developed from our improved insights into the mechanism of life. However, only the foolish will predict how far this new knowledge will lead us, and more particularly, at what speed new therapies will follow.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li Wan Po, Alain","journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32187712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antoine van Leeuwenhoek","Abraham Trembley"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new insights","new medicines","new therapies","cell therapy","new knowledge","new therapeutic areas","progress","improved insights","oligonucleotide therapy","personalization of therapy","genomic medicine","secret of life","OBJECTIVE","COMMENT","ensuing study of cell programming","deeper understanding of cell replication","man\u0027s search","Targeted therapies","effective medicines","mechanism of life","strange organism","therapeutic monoclonal antibodies","induced stem cells","pharmacogenetics","considerable light","microscopic animalcules","Antoine van Leeuwenhoek","cellular development","historical backcloth","Abraham Trembley","elusive secrets","genetic insight","tutor","decades","gods","Leiden","treatment of disease","approach","increasing range of diseases","rejuvenative capacity of organisms","recent years","Inventive scientists","rejuvenation","CONCLUSION Immortality","Huge leaps"],"language":"en"},

Search terms included pharmacy technician/pharmacy assistant and cost or time or economic evaluation. After article selection in the web-based platform Covidence\u00A9, data was extracted, and a narrative review was performed. RESULTS A total of 16 publications were eligible for inclusion in the review. Pharmacy technicians practicing at advanced scope led to both cost savings and time savings. Six studies reported a cost saving, six reported a time saving and four reported both time and cost savings. Annual savings ranged from AUD $4526 - $88,719.89, linked primarily to the difference in wages between pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Studies that focused on time savings evaluated checking dispensed items, taking medication histories and entering chemotherapy orders; demonstrating savings of up to 5 min per task completed.

Ventilation via a mouthpiece (MPV) is an option to offer daytime NIV. OBJECTIVES To determine the preferred equipment for MPV by patients with NMDs. METHODS Two MPV equipment sets were compared in 20 patients with NMDs. Set 1, consisted of a non-dedicated ventilator for MPV (PB560, Covidien) with a plastic angled mouthpiece. Set 2, consisted of a dedicated MPV ventilator (Trilogy 100, Philips Respironics) without back-up rate and kiss trigger combined with a silicone straw mouthpiece. The Borg dyspnea score, ventilator free time, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) and carbon dioxide tension (TcCO2 ) were recorded with and without MPV. Patient perception was assessed by a 17-items list. RESULTS TcCO2 measurements and total perception score were not different between the two MPV sets. Dyspnea score was lower with the non-dedicated versus dedicated equipment, 1 (0.5) vs 3 (1-6), p\u003C0.01. All patients with a ventilator free time lower than 6 hours preferred a set backup rate rather than a kiss trigger. Sixty five percent of patients preferred the commercial arm support and 55% preferred the plastic angled mouthpiece. CONCLUSIONS Dedicated and non-dedicated MPV equipment are deemed effective and comfortable. Individualization of arm support and mouthpiece is advised to ensure success of MPV. A ventilator free time lower than 6 hours seems to be a useful indicator to a priori set a back-up rate rather than a rate at zero associated to the kiss trigger.","publish_time":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toussaint, Michel; Chatwin, Michelle; Verhulst, Stijn; Reychler, Gregory","journal":"The clinical respiratory journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31799796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Philips Respironics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dedicated MPV ventilator","non-dedicated MPV equipment","MPV sets","dedicated equipment","MPV equipment sets","success of MPV","non-dedicated ventilator","preferred equipment","ventilator free time lower","back-up rate","BACKGROUND Patients","percent of patients","kiss trigger","NMDs","plastic angled mouthpiece","set backup rate","silicone straw mouthpiece","hours","total perception score","Borg dyspnea score","commercial arm support","Individualization of arm support","noninvasive ventilation","Patient perception","daytime NIV","RESULTS TcCO2 measurements","transcutaneous oxygen saturation","SpO2","Philips Respironics","Covidien","PB560","carbon dioxide tension","respiratory failure","neuromuscular disorders","Trilogy","option","CONCLUSIONS","useful indicator","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","items list","vs"],"language":"en"},

Currently, only Infrared Thermography (IRT) is used for screening and measuring facial skin temperature, which is one of clinical indicators of potential infection. Aiming at higher accuracy in screening, our group adopted heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) for the first time as the new screening parameters. In our previous study, we proposed a screening system based on dual image sensors, which include IRT and a charged-coupled devices (CCD) camera. The sensors can measure three vital signs simultaneously, namely HR, RR, and facial skin temperature. For the measurement of RR in this system, stability and swiftness must be applied for application in airports. In this study, we introduce feature matching and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in this system. Feature matching between thermal images and RGB images captured by a CCD camera and IRT, respectively, is used to detect the nose and mouth in IRT, which helps extract respiration signals corresponding to airflow from breathing. In addition, the MUSIC algorithm improves the accuracy of RR frequency estimations in limited time respiration signal and achieves swiftness. The proposed method improves stability by simultaneously detecting the nose and mouth in thermal images, and enhances the accuracy of estimated RR using the MUSIC algorithm. By using this system, we evaluate the accuracy of the estimated vital signs. The performance of this screening system was evaluated using data obtained from 12 influenza patients and 13 healthy subjects at a clinical facility in Fukushima, Japan.","publish_time":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negishi, Toshiaki; Sun, Guanghao; Sato, Shohei; Liu, He; Matsui, Takemi; Abe, Shigeto; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Kirimoto, Tetsuo","journal":"Conference proceedings : ...

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES GlaxoSmithKline\u0027s (GSK\u0027s) ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for individual patient level data (IPD) and GSK\u0027s Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019 for summary level data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials that compared rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS For analyses of trials for which IPD were available, a composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death was examined. These four events were examined independently as secondary analyses. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were examined, which were determined from summary level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted that accounted for trials with zero events in one or both arms with two different continuity corrections (0.5 constant and treatment arm) to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS 33 eligible trials were identified from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for which IPD were available (21 156 patients). Additionally, 103 trials for which IPD were not available were included in the meta-analyses for myocardial infarction (23 683 patients), and 103 trials for which IPD were not available contributed to the meta-analyses for cardiovascular related death (22 772 patients). Among 29 trials for which IPD were available and that were included in previous meta-analyses using GSK\u0027s summary level data, more myocardial infarction events were identified by using IPD instead of summary level data for 26 trials, and fewer cardiovascular related deaths for five trials. When analyses were limited to trials for which IPD were available, and a constant continuity correction of 0.5 and a random effects model were used to account for trials with zero events in only one arm, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 33% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.61; rosiglitazone population: 274 events among 11 837 patients; control population: 219 events among 9319 patients). The odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death were 1.17 (0.92 to 1.51), 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09), 1.15 (0.55 to 2.41), and 1.18 (0.60 to 2.30), respectively. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, odds ratios for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were attenuated (1.09, 0.88 to 1.35, and 1.12, 0.72 to 1.74, respectively). Results were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated using trials with zero events across both arms and either of the two continuity corrections was used. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, especially for heart failure events. Although increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed across analyses, the strength of the evidence varied and effect estimates were attenuated when summary level data were used in addition to IPD. Because more myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular related deaths were reported in the IPD than in the summary level data, sharing IPD might be necessary when performing meta-analyses focused on safety.

In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day \u002B Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). RESULTS We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days. CONCLUSIONS Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diurno, F; Numis, F G; Porta, G; Cirillo, F; Maddaluno, S; Ragozzino, A; De Negri, P; Di Gennaro, C; Pagano, A; Allegorico, E; Bressy, L; Bosso, G; Ferrara, A; Serra, C; Montisci, A; D\u0027Amico, M; Schiano Lo Morello, S; Di Costanzo, G; Tucci, A G; Marchetti, P; Di Vincenzo, U; Sorrentino, I; Casciotta, A; Fusco, M; Buonerba, C; Berretta, M; Ceccarelli, M; Nunnari, G; Diessa, Y; Cicala, S; Facchini, G","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_20875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eculizumab"],"organizations":["ASL Napoli","ARDS","Mean C Reactive Protein"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe pneumonia","CONCLUSIONS Eculizumab","infusions of eculizumab","case series of patients","label treatment of COVID","treatment of severe cases of COVID","results support eculizumab use","antiviral therapy","intensive care unit","anticoagulant therapy","related pneumonia","ARDS","Coronavirus Disease","days","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","anti-complement C5 therapy","vitamine C","mean duration","label agent","Mean C Reactive Protein levels","confirmed diagnosis of SARS","OBJECTIVE SARS-CoV","CoV2 infection","subcutaneous injection","ICU","IU","Lopinavir","preliminary data","key player","Enoxaparin","high morbidity","ASL Napoli","mortality","public health emergency","confirmation","potential","hydroxychloroquine","Ritonavir","ongoing SOLID-C19 trial","ceftriaxone","approved specific pharmacological treatments","Nord","Non-Invasive Ventilation","drop","inflammatory markers","METHODS","NIV"],"language":"en"},

In Northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China. Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak. We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety. Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and update on a daily basis.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carenzo, L; Costantini, E; Greco, M; Barra, F L; Rendiniello, V; Mainetti, M; Bui, R; Zanella, A; Grasselli, G; Lagioia, M; Protti, A; Cecconi, M","journal":"Anaesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["Hospital multidisciplinary","patient care","dedicated ICU","Dedicated protocols","hospital managers","hospital safety","establishment of dedicated","training of hospitals","cohorted intensive care unit","hospital emergency process","shortage of intensive care beds","staff recruitment","critical care crisis","dedicated task force","isolation of suspected","healthcare services","isolation of spaces","patient management","novel coronavirus","person transmission","positive patients","Northern Italy","design of appropriate procedures","largest known COVID","current coronavirus outbreak","principles of surge capacity","multilevel involvement of healthcare providers","diagnosis","pre-triage","space definition","personal protective equipment","common goal","supplies provision","re-discussion","update","outbreaks","confirmed cases","ad","preparedness","daily basis","response plan","routine","Asia","review","departmental collaboration","severe disruptions","infection chain","data","China","experience"],"language":"en"},

All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawar, Tushar; Pokharkar, Ashish; Gori, Jayesh; Pandey, Diwakar; Rohila, Jitender; Dsouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish","journal":"Journal of laparoendoscopic \u0026 advanced surgical techniques.

Aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between RD and cardiac sympathetic innervation in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with mild-to-severe HF underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation, evaluating early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate. In all patients, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula was assessed. A direct association was found between EPI-eGFR and late H/M (r = .215; P \u003C .001). Dividing the population into moderate-to-severe eGFR reduction and normal-to-mildly reduced eGFR (cutoff \u2264 60 mL\u00B7min-1\u00B71.73 m-2), a statistically significant reduction of late H/M value was found in patients with RD compared to patients with preserved eGFR (P = .030). By multivariable linear regression analysis, eGFR resulted in the prediction of impaired late H/M in patients with RD (P = .005). Patients with RD and HF show more impaired cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients with preserved renal function, and reduced eGFR is a predictor of reduced late H/M.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marsico, Fabio; Paolillo, Stefania; Gargiulo, Paola; Parisi, Valentina; Nappi, Carmela; Assante, Roberta; Dell\u0027Aversana, Simona; Esposito, Immacolata; Renga, Francesco; Esposito, Luca; Bardi, Luca; Rengo, Giuseppe; Dellegrottaglie, Santo; Marciano, Caterina; Leosco, Dario; Cuocolo, Alberto; Filardi, Pasquale Perrone","journal":"Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12350-019-01975-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31808105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HF patients","reduced eGFR","preserved eGFR","EPI-eGFR","severe HF","late heart","predictor of reduced late H","severe eGFR reduction","prediction of impaired late H","impaired sympathetic innervation","significant reduction of late H","cardiac sympathetic innervation","impaired cardiac sympathetic activity","reduced ejection fraction","heart failure","preserved renal function","potential relationship","renal dysfunction","CKD-EPI","washout rate","glomerular filtration rate","Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration","meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy","iodine","data","value","multivariable linear regression analysis","ratios","strict correlation","mediastinum","formula","direct association","present study","population","cutoff"],"language":"en"},

Recently, CEIRS developed an Influenza Response Plan (IRP) to improve science preparedness for the network. METHODS Development of the IRP involved a collaborative process between project staff, CEIRS center directors or their designees, and NIAID CEIRS leadership (referred to as the Pandemic Planning Advisory Committee [PPAC]). Project staff identified and summarized the response capabilities of each center and then worked with the PPAC to identify and rank research priorities for an emergency response using a modified Delphi method. RESULTS Key elements of the response plan include tables of response capabilities for each CEIRS center, a framework that outlines and ranks research priorities for CEIRS during an emergency situation, and an operational strategy for executing the research priorities. CONCLUSIONS The CEIRS IRP highlights the importance of enhancing science preparedness in advance of an influenza pandemic or other influenza-related zoonotic incident to ensure that research can be carried out expeditiously and effectively in emergency situations and to improve global health security.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Kristine A; Ostrowsky, Julia T; Mehr, Angela J; Osterholm, Michael T","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US National Institutes of Health","Influenza Response Plan","IRP","NIAID CEIRS","Pandemic Planning Advisory Committee","PPAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza Research","CEIRS IRP","emergency response","Influenza Response Plan","CEIRS center directors","influenza pandemic","conducting research","rank research priorities","NIAID CEIRS leadership","tables of response capabilities","understanding of influenza viruses","emergency situations","influenza-related zoonotic incident","project staff","science preparedness","PPAC","network","operational strategy","global health security","Pandemic Planning Advisory Committee","US National Institutes of Health","importance","designees","collaborative process","advance","Surveillance","Centers of Excellence","RESULTS Key elements","modified Delphi method","framework","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS Development"],"language":"en"},

In this review, the authors compared two coronavirus outbreaks during the past two decades: the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Among the biological nature of the pathogens, viral receptor distribution on the human cells, and the pathological findings in the targeted organs and clinical features of the patients with the diseases, found similarities and differences between the two diseases.

Like the SARS-CoV disease, COVID-19 is a systematic disease and targets the lungs, vasculatures, and the immune system. The basic pathogenesis involves two interlinked processes: a severe lung inflammation and immune deficiency, both of which are related to an inappropriate immune response and over-production of cytokines.

The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury which can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, while abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested.

However, renal dysfunction is often observed in patients with thromboembolic disease and was previously shown to be associated with increased D-dimer levels. We seek to validate previously suggested estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels. Furthermore, we strive to explore whether the type of renal dysfunction affects estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer test characteristics. DESIGN Single-center retrospective data analysis from electronic healthcare records of all emergency department patients admitted for suspected thromboembolic disease. SETTING Tertiary care academic hospital. SUBJECTS Exclusion criteria were as follows: age less than 16 years old, patients with active bleeding, and/or incomplete records. INTERVENTIONS Test characteristics of previously suggested that estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels (\u003E 333 \u00B5g/L [estimated glomerular filtration rate, \u003E 60 mL/min/1.73 m], \u003E 1,306 \u00B5g/L [30-60 mL/min/1.73 m], and \u003E 1,663 \u00B5g/L [\u003C 30 mL/min/1.73 m]) were validated and compared with the conventional D-dimer cutoff level of 500 \u00B5g/L. MAIN RESULTS A total of 14,477 patients were included in the final analysis, with 467 patients (3.5%) diagnosed with thromboembolic disease. Renal dysfunction was observed in 1,364 (9.4%) of the total population. When adjusted D-dimer levels were applied, test characteristics remained stable: negative predictive value (\u003E 99%), sensitivity (91.2% vs 93.4%), and specificity (42.7% vs 50.7%) when compared with the conventional D-dimer cutoff level to rule out thromboembolic disease (\u003C 500 \u00B5g/L).

METHODS Forty-five healthy participants accepted twirling, lifting-thrusting, and twirling plus lifting-thrusting manipulanions at right Zusanli (ST 36), respectively. The acupuncturist\u0027s and participants\u0027 Deqi sensations were collected by MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS). The intensity and occurrence rate of soreness, dull pain, pressure, heaviness, fullness, numbness, sharp pain, warmth, coolness, and throbbing feelings of participants, and tightness, smooth, and tangle feelings of acupuncturist were measured. The correlation between the acupuncturist\u0027s and participant\u0027s Deqi sensations was analyzed. Surface electromyogram (EMG) were recorded before, during and after needling in 30 participants. The integrated EMG (iEMG), mean power frequency (MPF) and media frequency (MF) were analyzed. RESULT Both fullness and soreness of participants and tightness of acupuncturist were the most frequently occurred ones. A positive correlation between participants\u0027 fullness and acupuncturist\u0027s tightness was observed during the three aforementioned needling manipulations (P\u003C0.05, OR\u003E1). Almost all the needling sensations measured in the present study could be induced by the three needling manipulations. However, strength of Deqi sensations was exhibited as lifting-thrusting \u003E twirling plus lifting-thrusting \u003E twirling according to MASS index. The iEMG values were increased and MPF, MF values were decreased during needling compaired to those before needling, especially during lifting-thrusting (P\u003C0.01). CONCLUSIONS The intensity and occurrence rate of the different Deqi sensations induced by different needling manipulations were basically similar. The fullness and soreness were both the most frequently induced Deqi sensations. The strongest Deqi sensation could be induced by lifting-thrusting manipulation. There is a positive correlation between participants\u0027 fullness and acupuncturist\u0027s tightness during the three needling manipulations. The myoelectricity around the acupoint is related to Deqi responses.

The purpose of this study was to review the results of standardizing AP techniques to reduce variation among clinicians and its effect on clinical outcomes. Standardized goal-directed protocols for AP were established by the cardiac team and applied to all adult cardiac surgical patients where CPB was used. Following Institutional Review Board approval, data were analyzed for two sequential groups of patients: Non-standardized AP (NST-AP) and standardized AP (ST-AP). Exclusion criteria included pre-CPB hemodynamic instability and preoperative hematocrit (Hct) values less than 30%. The primary end point was the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas secondary end points included Hct change and other perioperative allogeneic blood product transfusions. Data are presented as mean and SD. Of the 192 patients evaluated, 82 were in the NST-AP group and 110 in the ST-AP group. There were no preoperative demographic differences across groups. Total AP volume was lower in the NST-AP group than in the ST-AP patients (486.8 \u00B1 259.6 mL vs. 1,048.2 \u00B1 218.7 mL, p \u003C .001). Whereas pre-CPB Hct values were identical between the groups, the first on-CPB (25.7% \u00B1 4.5% vs. 27.9% \u00B1 4.2%, p \u003C .001), high CPB (27.7% \u00B1 3.5% vs. 29.1% \u00B1 3.6%, p \u003C .008), and first postoperative (32.5% \u00B1 4.0% vs. 34.3% \u00B1 3.9%, p \u003C .003) were all significantly higher in ST-AP patients. Perioperative transfusion rate was higher in NST-AP patients (63.6%) vs. ST-AP (44.6%), p \u003C .01. There was no difference in intraoperative RBC transfusion, but postoperatively, more patients in the NST-AP group received RBCs than those in the ST-AP group (51.2% vs. 28.2%, p \u003C .01). The application of an ST-AP protocol was effective in reducing hemodilution, which was associated within higher Hcts and lower postoperative transfusion rates.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"H Stammers, Alfred; Francis, Stephen; Tesdahl, Eric A; Miller, Randi; Nostro, Anthony; Mongero, Linda B","journal":"The journal of extra-corporeal technology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1182/ject-1900016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31915406/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPB","AP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NST-AP patients","NST-AP group","ST-AP protocol","Non-standardized AP","Total AP volume","results of standardizing AP techniques","sequential groups of patients","high CPB","pre-CPB Hct values","adult cardiac surgical patients","pre-CPB hemodynamic instability","Perioperative transfusion rate","lower postoperative transfusion rates","Hct change","cardiac surgery","RBCs","transfusion of red blood cells","higher Hcts","cardiac team","intraoperative RBC transfusion","Standardized goal","data","preoperative hematocrit","perioperative allogeneic blood product transfusions","secondary end points","primary end point","preoperative demographic differences","Institutional Review Board approval","clinicians","variation","Exclusion criteria","iatrogenic anemia","cardiopulmonary bypass","effect","hemodilution","clinical outcomes","extracorporeal circuit","protocols","application","Autologous priming","study","purpose"],"language":"en"},

To decrease person-to-person contact, health care providers have built many isolation wards. However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards. This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion. Materials and Methods: The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information. By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions. In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage. Results: The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion.

Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the H\u00FCfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfeifer, M; Ewig, S; Voshaar, T; Randerath, W; Bauer, T; Geiseler, J; Dellweg, D; Westhoff, M; Windisch, W; Sch\u00F6nhofer, B; Kluge, S; Lepper, P M","journal":"Pneumologie","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1157-9976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes","CPAP/NIV","DNI"],"locations":["Berlin"],"keyphrases":["therapy of ARI","NIV therapy","prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency","Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency","acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency","respiratory failure","Respiratory Medicine","respiratory helmet","CPAP therapy","pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes","inhalation therapy","therapy strategies","therapy escalation","high-flow oxygen","pulmonary infection","oxygen supply","early infection","non-invasive ventilation","Oxygen insufflation","increased risk of infection","position paper","SARS-CoV","high inspiratory oxygen fraction","high priority","extent of ARI","endotracheal intubation","nasal high-flow","invasive ventilation system","variables of oxygen saturation","protection of personnel","NHF","advanced COVID","significant proportion of patients","current knowledge","cooperation","personal protective equipment","current state of knowledge","continuous review process","standard review processes","eye protection","pulmonary manifestation","leakage systems","comparable unit","Open systems","nose mask","Temporal course","transmission of infectious viral particles","corrected values","Supply continuum","late phase","significant observations","H-type","relevant hypoxemia","Berlin criteria","special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4","severe hyperinflammatory phase","intensive care unit","release of respirable particles","changes","capillary blood gas analysis","room air conditions","FFP2","so-called vented masks","immunity","Hb value","types","H\u00FCfner number","induced lung damage","differences","Pneumology","German Society","ARDS","FiO2","use","phases","treatment of ARIKey points","core statements","order","aerosols","fear of contagion","appropriate expertise","pressing questions","specifications","calculation","DGP","mouth","professional societies","differential instrumentation","assessment","histopathologically substantiated - model","cardiac output","gown","cited studies","primary reason","Procedures","pandemic","staff","situation","team of experts","principle","associations","background","ARI5","disease3","topics","distinction","intubation","subsequent invasive ventilation","sufficient oxygen supply","progression of ARI","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure","place","ECMO","readiness","case of patients","guideline-based measures","continuous monitoring","DNI order","reason","NIV","delay","CO2","CPAP","times"],"language":"en"},

The weight of negative LNs in an inverse lymph node ratio (nR) should be related to its prognostic impact. Five hundred and two consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent radical gastrectomy, were included. Patients were split into groups according to the number of harvested nodes and a cross-tabulation with pTNM stages was performed to test differences in the tumor burden. pN\u002B patients (n = 296) were split into groups of negative LNs harvested. We tested an alternative formula for computing a lymph node ratio: nR = total number of harvested nodes/total number of positive nodes. The median number of negative LNs was significantly different (p \u003C 0.01) between dissection groups, but not the median of positive nodes (p \u003E 0.05). No difference in pTNM percentage distribution was found between these groups (p \u003E 0.05). When tested, the overall survival improved significantly for groups with larger numbers of negative LNs (p \u003C 0.001). A cutoff of nR \u2265 6 was an independent prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.001), and the survival of pN\u002B patients with nR \u2265 6 was not different from pN0 patients. The impact of the number of negative LNs on the survival of the pN\u002B patients was demonstrated. The higher numbers in the numerator of the nR was due to the disproportion between harvested negative LNs and metastatic LNs. Larger ratios imply more negative lymph nodes in relation to positive lymph nodes, which was significantly associated with survival.

Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus and retrovirus, co-opt host cellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here, the role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage of infection and subsequently partially rearranged to the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery for BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a pre-mature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that TER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral proteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of baculovirus life cycle including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.IMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA\u002B ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes including protein quality control, membrane fusion of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this study, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection including viral DNA replication and BV- and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane fission/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport to and further recruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories. This study highlights the critical roles of TER94 as an energy-supplying chaperon in the baculovirus life cycle and enriches our knowledge regarding the biological function of this important host factor.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yimeng; Hu, Liangbo; Chen, Tong; Chang, Meng; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Wang, Manli","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01674-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31896597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ODV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of TER94","association of TER94","IMPORTANCE TER94","viral DNA replication","host cellular TER94","fusion function of TER94","inhibition of TER94 activity","crucial functions of TER94","viral replication factories","critical roles of TER94","Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity","related viral proteins","recruit viral replication-related proteins","genome replication","viral early proteins LEF3","multiple steps of baculovirus life cycle","BV formation","optimal viral invasion","proper localization of replication","multiple steps of baculovirus infection","ODV formation","ODV morphogenesis","crucial role","ATPase crucial","BV production","morphogenesis of VS","membrane fusion","diverse cellular processes","prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus","early stage of infection","enveloped insect large DNA virus","protein quality control","helicase","blockage of ODV envelopment","membrane fission","important AAA","biological function","membrane biogenesis","pivotal function","virus-infected cells","virion morphogenesis","study","important host factor","occlusion-derived virus","nuclear periphery","multifunctional AAA","infected nuclei","trapping of nucleocapsids","budded virions","nuclear envelope reformation","pre-mature stage","endoplasmic reticulum network","Golgi apparatus","AcMNPV","interaction","chromatin dynamics","cytoplasmic vacuoles","subnuclear structures","herpesvirus","retrovirus","energy","virogenic stroma","BVs","knowledge","chaperon","explanation","eukaryotic organisms","immunoelectron microscopy","Previous proteomics analysis","coronavirus","data","ring zone region","viruses","evidence","analyses","date"],"language":"en"},

The exudative response is similar in the nose and bronchi and exudation occurs in both allergic asthma and rhinitis. The educative response is a specific end\u2010organ function of the mucosal microcirculation that may be altered in airway diseases. Objective This study examines the hypothesis of altered responsiveness of the superficial airway microcirculation to vascular permeability\u2010increasing challenges in sustained allergic inflammation. Methods Fourteen patients with birch\u2010pollen induced allergic rhinitis were studied for 7 weeks during a Swedish birch\u2010pollen season. Nasal symptoms (itching, sneezing. blockage, and discharge) were recorded and the occurrence of pollen was determined. The plasma exudation response was examined by topical histamine challenges at the end (May) and well out of (December) the season. Challenge and lavage were carried out concomitantly using a\u2018nasal pool\u2019 \u2010device. The unilateral nasal cavity was filled for consecutive 10 minute periods with saline and two concentrations of histamine (80\u03BCg/ mL and 400\u03BCg/mL). The lavage fluid levels of different\u2010sized plasma proteins (albumin\u201066 000 D. fibrinogen\u2010340000 D, and \u03B1 (2)\u2010macroglobulin\u2010725000D) were determined. Results The pollen season was mild resulting in only minor nasal symptoms. Histamine produced exudation of all plasma proteins across the microvascular epithelial barriers with particularly strong correlation between the levels of albumin and \u03B1 (2)\u2010macroglobulin (r =0.98; P\u003C 0.001). The exudative response to histamine was concentration\u2010dependent (P\u003C0.05) and, furthermore, it was significantly greater late into the season compared with outside the pollen season (albumin: P \u003C 0.05. tibrinogen: P\u003C0.05. \u03B1 (2)\u2010macroglobulin: P\u003C0.01). Conclusion We conclude that histamine produced concentration\u2010dependent nasal airway exudation of bulk plasma in subjects with seasonal rhinitis and that this response is abnormally great during the pollen season. Whether angiogenesis or increased responsiveness of the mierovascular endothelium may explain this phenomenon now remains unknown.

Transmission among humans occurs via close contact with an infected individual that produces respiratory droplets. Patients have been shown to undergo acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is defined as cytokine storm. The diagnosis relies on detection of nucleic acid, IgG/IgM antibodies, and a chest radiograph of the suspected individuals. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that comprise of ten open reading frames (ORFs). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exhibits higher affinity to ACE2 receptor as compared with SARS-CoV. Repurposing drugs like favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Personal protective measures should be followed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mRNA-1273, has been started.

Infection from the virus has since increased exponentially and has spread all over the world in more than 196 countries. The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The virus is highly infectious and can cause human-to-human transmission. Every 24 h, cases of COVID-19 increase severalfolds. The WHO is monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 spread very closely via a global surveillance system. The current situation demands the enforcement of strict laws which would help in inhibiting the further spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, international travel restrictions to affected countries, and hygiene are three important ways to nullify SARS-CoV-2.Government and private organizations need to come forward and work together during this pandemic.

The patterns displayed by these species are diverse, and different explanations are applicable to different patterns. Regional variation in SE Fennoscandian bog and extremely poor fen vegetation is described, based on all available published material. Carpets, lawns, and hummocks are considered separately. Four regional vegetational gradients are identified: (1) W\u2010E, (2) S\u2010N, (3) SW\u2010NE, and (4) NW\u2010SE. These are related to different underlying climatic gradients: (1) humidity (precipitation surplus), (2) temperature, (3) and (4) combinations of humidity and temperature. Effects of climatic gradients on the ground water regime are outlined. The decisive factor for the SW\u2010NE gradient is probably frequency of ground water table fluctuations, the NW\u2010SE gradient is likely to be caused by differences in water supply and ground water flow rates. The main gradient of carpets is S\u2010N (SE\u2010NW), of lawns SW\u2010NE (W\u2010E), and of hummocks partly SW\u2010NE, partly S\u2010N.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \u201Csandwich\u201D complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of our synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with IC(50) values of 12 nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning can only bind to RBD in vitro, but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Xin; Li, Lingfang; Lin, Jing; Li, Xinlei; Liu, Bin; Kong, Yang; Zeng, Shunze; Du, Jianhua; Xiao, Huahong; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Shelin; Liu, Jianghai","journal":"Antib Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9be4ef774dcde18cd989275e5e1c130f2c18af55.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of RBD","blocking antibodies of RBD","free RBD","Antibodies binding","ACE2-binding site","immobilized ACE2-Fc","screen blocking antibodies","enriched phage antibodies","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","discovery of neutralizing antibodies","High-affinity antibodies","standard biopanning","competitive biopanning strategy","receptor binding domain","synthetic antibody library","phage display antibody library","pseudovirus infection","lead","therapeutic monoclonal antibody","standard panning process","human cell receptor angiotensin","epitopes different","enzyme","Lib AB1","vaccine","spike protein","viral entry","Ni-NTA magnetic beads","values","work","rounds","promise","full-length IgG1 format","deaths","sandwich","neutralization activity","supernatant","complex","nM","bait"],"language":"en"},

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. METHODS: We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People\u0027s Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. FINDINGS: Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589\u00B75, 49\u00B73, and 37\u00B75 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2\u00B72 million. INTERPRETATION: Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Huai-liang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J.P.; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-Kit","journal":"EClinicalMedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f17a547e9c212c3ee216a42f687545e83e496c72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201017/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission","Centre for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Customs"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["facemask policy","facemask supply","different universal facemask","severe facemask shortage","global facemask shortage","country-wide universal facemask","domestic facemask supplies","major facemask producer","policy scenarios","policy implementation","largest daily facemask shortages","policy review","N95 mask shortage","regions of mainland China","facemasks","mathematical modelling shortage analyses","effective public communication","People\u0027s Republic of China","Disease Control","novel coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","effective measure","epicentre","affected regions","high-risk regions","COVID","healthcare workers","Public health measures","prediction period","novel infectious disease outbreaks","proper hand hygiene","effectiveness of outbreak control","severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus","global production","National Health Commission","risk of asymptomatic transmission","government websites","data","GAC","Ministry of Industry","NHC","MIIT","CDC","Prevention","priority","Information Technology","General Administration of Customs","enormous burden","social concern","infection","governments","Hubei province","worldwide demand","BACKGROUND","societal panic","increased demands","FINDINGS","METHODS","respect","duration","INTERPRETATION","pandemic","days"],"language":"en"},

The infection and mortality rates of the disease have forced governments to implement a wave of public health measures. Depending on the context, these range from the implementation of simple hygienic rules to measures such as social distancing or lockdowns that cause major disruptions in citizens\u2019 daily lives. The success of these crucial public health measures rests on the public\u0027s willingness to comply. However, individual differences in following the official public health recommendations for stopping the spread of COVID-19 have not yet to our knowledge been assessed. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of implementing public health recommendations that aim to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate these associations in the context of France, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and which ended up under a nationwide lockdown on March 17. In the next sections we describe our theoretical expectations over the associations between sociodemographics, personality, ideology, and emotions with abiding by the COVID-19 public health measures. We then test these hypotheses using data from the French Election Study.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, Sylvain; Vasilopoulos, Pavlos; Becher, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0433b03173d975d00dfd914f5db3fff215962af0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","France"],"keyphrases":["wave of public health measures","official public health recommendations","crucial public health measures rests","spread of COVID","associations","disease","pandemic","context of France","French Election Study","major disruptions","psychological correlates","social distancing","lockdowns","sociodemographics","ideology","implementation of simple hygienic rules","citizens\u2019 daily lives","public\u0027s willingness","data","theoretical expectations","range","personality","emotions","governments","abiding","success","mortality rates","individual differences","hypotheses","infection","gap","sections","Wuhan","nationwide lockdown","China","countries","world","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, most practical problems usually require good hyperparameter configurations within a limited time budget. To speed up the hyperparameter optimization, the successive halving technique is used to stop poorly-performed configurations as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperparameter optimization method FastHO, which combines the progressive multi-fidelity technique with successive halving under a multi-armed bandit framework. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian optimization to guide the selection of initial configurations and an efficient data subsampling based method to warm start the surrogate model of Bayesian optimization. Extensive empirical evaluation on a broad range of neural networks and datasets shows that FastHO is not only effective to speed up hyperparameter optimization but also can achieve better anytime performance and final performance than the state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Guanghui; Zhu, Ruancheng","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4290d42677bf8ace6d444d7a31002b6a24705a49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods","traditional Bayesian optimization","novel hyperparameter optimization method FastHO","good hyperparameter configurations","surrogate model of Bayesian optimization","Deep neural networks","size of state-of-the-art neural networks","successive halving technique","broad range of neural networks","final performance","best performance","selection of initial configurations","evaluation cost","progressive multi-fidelity technique","Extensive empirical evaluation","multi-armed bandit framework","efficient data subsampling based method","careful tuning of hyperparameters","datasets","limited time budget","practical problems","paper","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the pseudo labels generated on unlabeled nodes are usually overlooked during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a soft labels guided graph attention network (SLGAT) to improve the performance of node representation learning by leveraging generated pseudo labels. Unlike the prior graph attention networks, our SLGAT uses soft labels as guidance to learn different weights for neighboring nodes, which allows SLGAT to pay more attention to the features closely related to the central node labels during the feature aggregation process. We further propose a self-training based optimization method to train SLGAT on both labeled and pseudo labeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train SLGAT on labeled nodes and generate pseudo labels for unlabeled nodes. Next, for each iteration, we train SLGAT on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled nodes, and then generate new pseudo labels for further training. Experimental results on semi-supervised node classification show that SLGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yubin; Zhang, Zhenyu; Liu, Tingwen; Guo, Li","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec8b72e4166f7115b14d47b6201502c0fffa1621.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SLGAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generated pseudo labels","new pseudo labels","unlabeled nodes","central node labels","neighboring nodes","pre-train SLGAT","soft labels guided graph attention network","node representations","semi-supervised node classification","aggregating node features","prior graph attention networks","performance of node representation learning","semi-supervised classification","graph-structured data","Graph convolutional neural networks","learning process","state-of-the-art performance","self-training","feature aggregation process","guidance","different weights","prediction loss","Experimental results","propagating","recent years","optimization method","combination","paper","iteration"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we propose a novel category-aware metric learning framework, which not only learns the cross-category compatibility notions but also preserves the intra-category diversity among items. Specifically, we define a category complementary relation representing a pair of category labels, e.g., tops-bottoms. Given a pair of item embeddings, we first project them to their corresponding relation space, then model the mutual relation of a pair of categories as a relation transition vector to capture compatibility amongst fashion items. We further derive a negative sampling strategy with non-trivial instances to enable the generation of expressive and discriminative item representations.

Real-world dynamic graphs are continuously evolved where new nodes and edges are introduced or removed during graph evolution. Most existing dynamic graph representation learning methods focus on modeling dynamic graphs with fixed nodes due to the complexity of modeling dynamic graphs, and therefore, cannot efficiently learn the evolutionary patterns of real-world evolving graphs. Moreover, existing methods generally model the structural information of evolving graphs separately from temporal information. This leads to the loss of important structural and temporal information that could cause the degradation of predictive performance of the model. By employing an innovative neural network architecture based on graph attention networks and temporal convolutions, our framework jointly learns graph representations contemplating evolving graph structure and temporal patterns. We propose a deep attention model to learn low-dimensional feature representations which preserves the graph structure and features among series of graph snapshots over time. Experimental results on multiple real-world dynamic graph datasets show that, our proposed method is competitive against various state-of-the-art methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fathy, Ahmed; Li, Kan","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dec07d951aaec8544e02c6b35ee83ac73f5ff1b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206228.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graph representations","Real-world dynamic graphs","graph evolution","evolving graph structure","multiple real-world dynamic graph datasets","graph attention networks","existing dynamic graph representation learning methods","complexity of modeling dynamic graphs","series of graph snapshots","temporal information","structural information of evolving graphs","numerous graph analytic tasks","dynamic link prediction","temporal patterns","evolutionary patterns of real-world evolving graphs","Learning representations","temporal convolutions","existing methods","deep attention model","various state-of-the-art methods","low-dimensional feature representations","fixed nodes","new nodes","loss of important structural","proposed method","framework","Experimental results","innovative neural network architecture","node classification","features","degradation of predictive performance","visualization","time","edges"],"language":"en"},

To address this issue, we propose the deep multimodal clustering with cross reconstruction method, which firstly focuses on multimodal feature extraction in an unsupervised way and then clusters these extracted features. The proposed cross reconstruction aims to build latent connections among different modalities, which effectively reduces the distribution differences in feature space. The theoretical analysis shows that the cross reconstruction reduces the Wasserstein distance of multimodal feature distributions.

In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario where attackers do not have access to target models and training data, our method achieves high fooling rates on target models and outperforms other universal adversarial perturbation methods.

We redesign the multi-stage problem to address both cases by combining adversarial autoencoders (AAE) and multi-task semi-supervised learning (MTSSL) to train an end-to-end neural network for all stages together. The AAE learns the representation of the data and performs data imputation in missing values.

Short-term transition dependencies contain the information of partial item orders, while long-term transition dependencies infer long-range user preference, the two dependencies are mutually restrictive and complementary. Although some work investigates unifying both long-term and short-term dependencies for better performance, they still neglect the fact that short-term interactions are multi-folds, which are either individual-level interactions or union-level interactions. Existing sequential recommendations mainly focus on user\u2019s individual (i.e., individual-level) interactions but ignore the important collective influence at union-level. Since union-level interactions can reflect that human decisions are made based on multiple items he/she has already interacted, ignoring such interactions can result in the disability of capturing the collective influence between items. To alleviate this issue, we proposed a Joint Relational Dependency learning (JRD-L) for sequential recommendation that exploits both long-term and short-term preferences at individual-level and union-level. Specifically, JRD-L combines long-term user preferences with short-term interests by measuring short-term pair relations at individual-level and union-level. Moreover, JRD-L can alleviate the sparsity problem of union-level interactions by adding more descriptive details to each item, which is carried by individual-level relations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate JRD-L outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for the sequential recommendation.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiangmeng; Li, Qian; Zhang, Wu; Xu, Guandong; Liu, Shaowu; Zhu, Wenhao","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b98c25235193717866dcb7aad2a401a7a943283.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Joint Relational Dependency"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual-level interactions","union-level interactions","short-term interactions","individual-level relations","short-term dependencies","Short-term transition dependencies","long-term transition dependencies","short-term preferences","JRD","short-term interests","user\u2019s individual","long-term user preferences","short-term pair relations","sparsity problem of union","long-range user preference","better inferring user preference","Existing sequential recommendations","important collective influence","information of partial item orders","better performance","multiple items","temporal information of users\u2019 transactions","fact","multi-folds","Joint Relational Dependency learning","state-of-the-art baselines","human decisions","academic research","practical applications","descriptive details","unifying","Extensive numerical experiments","work","disability","issue"],"language":"en"},

To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to learn sentiment-aware representations from easily accessible unlabeled data specifically for the fine-grained sentiment learning. This is very different from current popular semi-supervised solutions that use the unlabeled data via pretraining to generate generic representations for various types of downstream tasks. Particularly, we show for the first time that we can learn and detect some highly sentiment-discriminative neural units from the unsupervised pretrained model, termed neural sentiment units. Due to the discriminability, these sentiment units can be leveraged by downstream LSTM-based classifiers to generate sentiment-aware and context-dependent word representations to substantially improve their sentiment classification performance. Extensive empirical results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach (i) substantially outperforms state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers and (ii) achieves significantly better data efficiency.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jingjing; Yang, Yao; Pang, Guansong; Lv, Lei; Shang, Hong; Sun, Zhongqian; Yang, Wei","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45c9c1022e0345f344a37f8e1522a048b57ed805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sentiment-aware representations","neural sentiment units","sentiment classification performance","state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers","Target-level sentiment classification","assigning sentiment polarities","fine-grained sentiment learning","document-level sentiment classification","sentiment-discriminative neural units","accessible unlabeled data","generic representations","large-scale labeled data","sentence","better data efficiency","novel semi-supervised approach","context-dependent word representations","downstream LSTM-based classifiers","target words","current popular semi-supervised solutions","various types of downstream tasks","unsupervised pretrained model","intricate contexts","benchmark datasets","opinion targets","pretraining","Extensive empirical results","relations","challenge","discriminability"],"language":"en"},

Recently, many state-of-the-art models have been proposed to achieve low-order and high-order feature interactions.

In this paper, a novel multi-scale feature-crossing attention network (MsFcNET) is proposed to extract dense-and-implicit cross features and learn their importance in the different scales. The model adopts the DIA-LSTM units to construct a new attention calibration architecture, which can adaptively adjust the weights of features in the process of feature interactions. On the other hand, it also integrates a multi-scale feature-crossing module to strengthen the representation ability of cross features from multi-field sparse data. The extensive experimental results on three real-world prediction datasets demonstrate that our proposed model yields superior performance compared with the other state-of-the-art models.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Zhifeng; Zhang, Wenling; Ding, Huiming; Ma, Lizhuang","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41b8af69ef1c6756cb51b097278d867ca79bf260.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implicit cross features","importance of cross features","weights of features","representation ability of cross features","novel multi-scale feature","Feature engineering","process of feature interactions","high-order feature interactions","proposed model","multi-field sparse data","multi-filed sparse data","negative impact of useless features","state-of-the-art models","attention network","low-order","new attention calibration architecture","real-world prediction datasets","module","extensive experimental results","DIA-LSTM units","superior performance","MsFcNET","paper","different scales","hand"],"language":"en"},

It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. There is, however, a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To assess whether penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the RNA viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82), and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data run counter to the idea that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Harvey, Erin; Shi, Mang; Gonzalez-Acu\u00F1a, Daniel; Holmes, Edward C; Hurt, Aeron C","journal":"The ISME journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0643-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Antarctica","Antarctic"],"keyphrases":["Antarctic penguins","species of penguins","Antarctic species","viral species","Antarctic peninsula","tick viruses","penguin diet","likely penguin","microbial diversity","level of virome diversity","iconic Antarctic animal","limited understanding of virome diversity","associated microorganisms","repeated detection of specific viruses","lower pathogen pressure","experiences low pathogen pressure","RNA viromes","total RNA","viral families","situ virus evolution","key virus reservoirs","home","accounting","Antarctica","idea","extent","diverse fauna","disease susceptibility","extreme climate","animals","microbiome","ticks","data run counter","foreign environments","isolation","Australian waterbirds","geographic regions","hosts","potential"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this review was to characterize the associations between patient-provider interpersonal interventions and the quadruple aim outcomes (population health, patient experience, cost, and provider experience). METHODS We sourced data from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo (January 1997-August 2017). Selected studies included randomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies that examined the association between patient-provider interpersonal interventions and at least one outcome measure of the quadruple aim. Two abstractors independently extracted information about study design, methods, and quality. We characterized evidence related to the objective of the intervention, type and duration of intervention training, target recipient (provider-only vs. provider-patient dyad), and quadruple aim outcomes. RESULTS Seventy-three out of 21,835 studies met the design and outcome inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of research was moderate to high for most included studies; 67% of interventions targeted the provider. Most studies measured impact on patient experience; improvements in experience (e.g., satisfaction, patient-centeredness, reduced unmet needs) often corresponded with a positive impact on other patient health outcomes (e.g., quality of life, depression, adherence). Enhanced interpersonal interactions improved provider well-being, burnout, stress, and confidence in communicating with difficult patients. Roughly a quarter of studies evaluated cost, but the majority reported no significant differences between intervention and control groups. Among studies that measured time in the clinical encounter, intervention effects varied. Interventions with lower demands on provider time and effort were often as effective as those with higher demands. DISCUSSION Simple, low-demand patient-provider interpersonal interventions may have the potential to improve patient health and patient and provider experience, but there is limited evidence that these interventions influence cost-related outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haverfield, Marie C; Tierney, Aaron; Schwartz, Rachel; Bass, Michelle B; Brown-Johnson, Cati; Zionts, Dani L; Safaeinili, Nadia; Fischer, Meredith; Shaw, Jonathan G; Thadaney, Sonoo; Piccininni, Gabriella; Lorenz, Karl A; Asch, Steven M; Verghese, Abraham; Zulman, Donna M","journal":"Journal of general internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-05525-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patient experience","provider experience","provider-patient dyad","provider time","patient health outcomes","low-demand patient-provider interpersonal interventions","patient-centeredness","provider well-being","included studies","effectiveness of interpersonal interventions","Selected studies","quarter of studies","interventions influence cost-related outcomes","quadruple aim outcomes","controlled observational studies","interpersonal interactions","intervention effects","population health","duration of intervention training","quality of life","METHODS","methodological quality of research","outcome measure","study design","positive impact","lower demands","limited evidence","higher demands","randomized controlled trials","outcome inclusion criteria","burnout","potential","target recipient","significant differences","type","effort","majority","improvements","associations","heart of medical care","clinical encounter","confidence","questions","PubMed","control groups","information","stress","DISCUSSION Simple","satisfaction","unmet needs","BACKGROUND Human connection","EMBASE","data","abstractors","depression","adherence","objective","difficult patients","PsycInfo","review","purpose","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

There is considerable concern that widespread infection will result in a surge of critically ill patients that will overwhelm our present adult ICU capacity. In this setting, one proposal to add \u0022surge capacity\u0022 has been the use of PICU beds and physicians to care for these critically ill adults. DESIGN Narrative review/perspective. SETTING Not applicable. PATIENTS Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The virus\u0027s high infectivity and prolonged asymptomatic shedding have resulted in an exponential growth in the number of cases in the United States within the past weeks with many (up to 6%) developing acute respiratory distress syndrome mandating critical care services. Coronavirus disease 2019 critical illness appears to be primarily occurring in adults. Although pediatric intensivists are well versed in the care of acute respiratory distress syndrome from viral pneumonia, the care of differing aged adult populations presents some unique challenges. In this statement, a team of adult and pediatric-trained critical care physicians provides guidance on common \u0022adult\u0022 issues that may be encountered in the care of these patients and how they can best be managed in a PICU.

OBJECTIVE To assess health literacy, disease knowledge, treatment dissatisfaction and biologics attitudes toward COVID-19. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics - 51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa. An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to i) epidemiology, ii) pathogenesis, iii) clinical symptoms, iv) preventive measures and v) attitudes. Patients data and questionnaires were collected. RESULTS Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively. Globally, male patients(p=0.001) with higher scholarity level(p=0.005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19. Patients with lower DLQI(p=0.006), longer disease duration(p=0.051) and lower scholarity(p=0.007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy.At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation versus discontinuation and modification versus no modification, respectively.

OBJECTIVES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on corticosteroid use in ARDS. METHODS A search of four medical literature databases was conducted. We retained randomized trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults with ARDS in a search up to February, 2020. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Authors assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS We included seven RCTs (n=851 patients). Corticosteroids reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.95, p=0.02, moderate certainty) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference [MD] -4.93 days, 95% CI: -7.81 days to -2.06 days, p\u003C0.001, low certainty), and increased ventilator-free days (VFD) (MD 4.28 days, 95% CI: 2.67 days to 5.88 days, p\u003C0.001, moderate certainty), when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids also increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.12%, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.24, p=0.03, moderate certainty), and the effect on neuromuscular weakness was unclear (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.11, p=0.28, low certainty). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that systemic corticosteroids may potentially improve mortality, ventilator duration, and VFD in patients with ARDS. However, the studies included different corticosteroid classes and initiated the corticosteroid doses at different times, as well as different dosing regimens. Thus caution in the actual clinical application of these results is recommended.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mammen, Manoj J; Aryal, Komal; Alhazzani, Waleed; Alexander, Paul E","journal":"Polish archives of internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["moderate certainty","ARDS","low certainty","RR","increased ventilator-free days","results","systemic corticosteroids","different corticosteroid classes","corticosteroid use","corticosteroid doses","VFD","ventilator duration","MD","different times","risk ratio","search","RCTs","risk of hyperglycemia","risk of bias","patients","high mortality rate","all-cause mortality","different dosing regimens","eligible studies","duration of mechanical ventilation","meta-analysis","systematic review","mean difference","Development","specific pharmacological therapy","INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory distress syndrome","inflammatory lung disease","effect","hospitalized adults","Grading of Recommendations","Evaluation","Assessment","neuromuscular weakness","evidence","medical literature databases","GRADE","METHODS","actual clinical application","randomized trials","CONCLUSIONS","approach","OBJECTIVES","reviewers","Authors","placebo"],"language":"en"},

We encountered a patient with thoracic pneumatosis after frequent displacement of the tracheal tube with an overinflated cuff. CASE PRESENTATION We admitted a 62-year-old man to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. We secured his airway using a cuffed 8.5-mm tracheal tube. However, air leakage did not stop with the regular intracuff pressure (25 cm H2O) because the diameter of his trachea was too large for the tracheal tube inserted. In addition, a chest X-ray examination revealed rostral tube displacement. Therefore, we applied a higher intracuff pressure (35 cm H2O) to prevent air leakage and tracheal tube movement. However, severe coughing episodes developed, and 3 days after ICU admission, a chest X-ray and CT scan revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. We did not have larger tracheal tubes in stock. We decided to use a tracheostomy tube instead, which we expected to be placed securely and to prevent tube displacement. After tracheostomy, the severe coughing episodes became infrequent. Finally, we weaned the patient from mechanical ventilation 12 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS The clinical signs and symptoms in our patient point to tracheal tube size mismatch as the cause of pneumothorax.","publish_time":"2019-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tachiiri, Yuka; Inoue, Satoki; Kawaguchi, Masahiko","journal":"JA clinical reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-019-0227-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Thoracic","ICU","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tracheal tube movement","tracheostomy tube","tracheal tube size mismatch","rostral tube displacement","larger tracheal tubes","ICU admission","patient point","mechanical ventilation","days","H2O","frequent displacement","severe coughing episodes","air leakage","chest X-ray examination","BACKGROUND Thoracic pneumatosis","regular intracuff pressure","higher intracuff pressure","cause of pneumothorax","symptoms","CT scan","intensive care unit","pneumomediastinum","year-old man","clinical signs","CONCLUSIONS","diameter","addition","stock","overinflated cuff","respiratory failure","CASE PRESENTATION","airway"],"language":"en"},

Paediatric burn patients\u0027 pain remains poorly managed by pharmacological interventions, leading to increased anxiety, distress, and trauma in patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological psychosocial interventions have been suggested as effective in reducing pain and psychological morbidities among paediatric burn patients and their caregivers; however, their degree of effectiveness and appropriateness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is unclear. METHODS A non-date restricted systematic review was conducted through four databases. Studies published in English assessing psychosocial interventions on paediatric burn patients\u0027 physical pain along with theirs and/or their caregiver\u0027s anxiety, distress, or trauma symptoms were identified and included in this review. Included studies were assessed for their ability to reduce one of the outcomes of interests and for their reflection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u0027 perspectives of health.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases. CONCLUSION The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zareie, Bushra; Roshani, Amin; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Rasouli, Mohammad Aziz; Moradi, Ghobad","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAM"],"locations":["China","Iran"],"keyphrases":["number of Covid","predictions of Iran","epidemiological data of Iran","parameters of time","time-dependent recovery rate","rapid spread of COVID","dependent transmission rate","shortest time","epidemiological analysis","China","epidemic peaks","results","people","infected cases","timedependent death rate","public readiness","hospital readiness","outbreaks of disease","number of patients","important point","highest point","government measures","timing","virus","increased awareness of effective interventions","R software","countries","social contact","mgcv package","BACKGROUND","month","infections","SIR model","analyses","CONCLUSION","GAM models","days","study","average","purpose","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare a modified technique of membrane fixation that utilizes periosteal sutures (using a pouch design) with the traditional approach, which does not use membrane fixation. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with a total of 168 teeth treated were divided into two groups: 1-A, in which patients were treated using the modified technique (with membrane fixation), and group 2-B, in which patients were treated using the traditional technique (without membrane fixation). The postoperative bone thickness was evaluated via radiographic examination. RESULTS Postoperative improvements in bone augmentation were detected in both groups. At 12 months, the values of the CHBT (measured from the midpoint of the coronal third to the labial cortical surface, 0.84 \u00B1 0.33 mm) and the values of VBL (measured from the alveolar crest to the cemento-enamel junction, - 2.35 \u00B1 0.80 mm)were significantly greater in the modified technique group than those in the traditional technique group (CHBT:0.12 \u00B1 0.21 mm and VBL:-1.39 \u00B1 0.99 mm; P = 0.00 and P = 0.01).

Mean sedation grade was 3.86 in group A and 2.71 in group B (p: 0.016). Mean total opioid dose was 70.9 mg in group A and 10 mg in group B (p:0.00015). No complications were observed. At 12 months, mean volume reduction was 56.1% in the group A and 60% in the group B. In thyroid radiofrequency ablation, subcapsular anesthesia can decrease both total opioid dose and level of patient\u0027s sedation without significant differences in tolerability, allowing to perform ablation without the anesthesiologist.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morelli, F; Ierardi, A M; Biondetti, P; Zannoni, S; Pompili, G; Sacrini, A; Coppola, A; Rod\u00E0, G; Angileri, S A; Carrafiello, G","journal":"Medical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01347-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group B"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Group B","Mean tolerability","Mean sedation grade","anesthesiologist","intravenous midazolam","intravenous acetaminophen","intravenous remifentanil","subcapsular anesthesia","total opioid dose","subcutaneous anesthesia","deep sedation","mean age","local anesthesia","level of patient\u0027s sedation","sedation-related risks","thyroid radiofrequency ablation","mean volume reduction","consecutive patients","months","complications","mild systemic sedoanalgesia","benign thyroid nodules","invasive procedure alternative","treatment of benign conditions","oral solution morphine sulfate","fentanyl","nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","Ramsay scale","surgery","significant differences","mepivacaine","compressive symptoms","hospital costs","years","presence","bupivacaine","lidocaine","results","study","groups"],"language":"en"},

This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out between 3 and 27 March 2020 on a sample of 1389 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Poland. Data were obtained from epidemiological reports collected by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. Analysis includes the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, number of people quarantined, and number of laboratory tests performed. RESULTS The first case was confirmed on 4 March 2020. Over 24 days after the first case, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 1389 (34,000 laboratory tests were performed). The highest incidence rates (over 5 per 100,000) were observed in the 2 central administrative regions (Mazowieckie and \u0141\u00F3dzkie) and in the south-western region of Dolno\u015Bl\u0105skie, which borders the Czech Republic and Germany. Based on available data about age and sex, a clearly higher incidence was observed in the 20-29 years (4.0 per 100,000), 40-49 years (4.1 per 100,000), and 50-59 years (4.3 per 100,000) age groups. In the period analyzed (24 days), there were 16 confirmed deaths (average age 65.5 years; 81.2% males). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of women and men with confirmed COVID-19 infection was similar to the sex ratio in the general population. Infections were relatively less common in those aged under 20 years. The largest numbers of confirmed cases were detected in 3 of the 4 largest cities, each of which has an international airport.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gujski, Mariusz; Raciborski, Filip; Jankowski, Mateusz; Nowicka, Paulina Maria; Rakocy, Kamil; Pinkas, Jaros\u0142aw","journal":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Czech Republic"],"keyphrases":["number of COVID","confirmed COVID","years","number of deaths","confirmed deaths","total number of confirmed infections","number of laboratory tests","number of hospitalizations","number of people","largest numbers of confirmed cases","average age","epidemiological analysis","age groups","Poland","days","sex ratio","epidemiological reports","available data","higher incidence","largest cities","highest incidence rates","\u0141\u00F3dzkie","proportion of women","Mazowieckie","central administrative regions","World Health Organization","phase","Chief Sanitary Inspectorate","south-western region of Dolno\u015Bl\u0105skie","Czech Republic","cross-sectional study","MATERIAL","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","general population","epidemic","Germany","paper","global pandemic","males","sample","international airport","period"],"language":"en"},

However, their drug release processes were usually discussed in the absence of proteins, which are abundant in real delivery media and likely to affect the release behaviors. In this work, novel pH-sensitive silica-based DDSs were constructed using the endogenous protein, human serum albumin (HSA), as the gatekeeper, and their release properties in protein-containing media were measured for the first time. As-synthesized mesoporous silica nanorod (MSNR) was modified with zwitterions to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of protein and to improve the dispersity. HSA was fixed onto MSNR through drug-protein interactions and covalent bonds, respectively. Benzoic-imine bonds were introduced into the designs to realize pH responsiveness. The fluorescence quenching effect of drugs on HSA was used to monitor the drug release in simulated body fluids containing proteins. The results indicated that protein gating could effectively reduce premature release in normal blood environment. The endogenous protein capping, high dispersity and stability, considerable loading content, low cytotoxicity and favorable responsiveness to acidic microenvironment enable the present structures to be promising carriers for chemotherapy drugs.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Huaxin; Xia, Qinghua; Zhou, Dan","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the \u0022first proto-farmers,\u0022 humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies \u0022developed,\u0022 and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of \u0022agriculture\u0022 on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to \u0022pesticides\u0022 in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brain, Richard A; Anderson, Julie C","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08980-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["terms of land use","wildlife SSOs","land use challenge","context of land use change","existing land","terms of driving SSOs","modern societies","economic developmental status","implication of conventional agriculture","agricultural frontier","agricultural origins","inevitable economic transition","agricultural footprint","humans","modern food production","application of pesticides","complicated factors","hunter-gatherer societies","generations","abundance of food","proverbial flood of urban development","broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes","figurative plague of invasive species","relative perspective","climate change","corresponding shift","pesticide narrative","developing countries","Urban centers","relative influence","right target","easy target","available evidence","available resources","literal plague of disease","population growth","associated implications of global connectivity","potential collateral environmental damage","barrage of buildings","experienced maximal expansion","industry","public awareness","service predominance","windshields","bumpers","grilles","commerce","fixation","questions","primary drivers","light pollution","profound impact","cues","manuscript","ancient ancestors","environments","technology","yield","misconceptions","addition","popular media","proto-farmers","dawn of civilization","expense of native habitats","poachers","contrast","farmland","reality","relativity","advent","Americans","opportunity","bear"],"language":"en"},

Using 3D virtual environments, we induce context-task demand probabilistic associations and find that learned associations affect goal-directed behavior. Concurrent fMRI data reveal that, upon entering a context, differences between hippocampal representations of contexts (i.e., neural pattern separability) predict proactive retrieval of the probabilistically dominant associated task demand, which is reinstated in dlPFC.

This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralise or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other immunoglobulins. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a \u0022scaffolding\u0022 role for Fc\u03B3R which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or may trigger catastrophic adverse effects.

A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual Fc\u03B3R function and the complexity of the relationships between Fc\u03B3Rs and antibodies is fuelling efforts to develop more potent \u0022next-gen\u0022 therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating Fc\u03B3Rs or the inhibitory Fc\u03B3RIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of Fc\u03B3R interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects Fc\u03B3R and IgG immunobiology and its relationship to the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chenoweth, Alicia M; Wines, Bruce D; Anania, Jessica C; Mark Hogarth, P","journal":"Immunology and cell biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32157732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic antibodies","therapeutic monoclonal antibodies","future actions of therapeutic mAbs","therapeutic mAb action","immunobiology of individual Fc\u03B3R function","novel mAbs","recent aspects Fc\u03B3R","ablation of Fc\u03B3R interaction","unmet therapeutic need","potent Fc\u03B3R-mediated effector systems","IgG immunobiology","human Fc\u03B3Rs","selective engagement of individual activating Fc\u03B3Rs","inflammatory diseases","immune agonism","development of improved","development strategies","use of mAb therapeutics","powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector functions","normal physiology of immune resistance","antigen-complexed IgG ligands","cancers","emerging infections","cancer cells","key","antibody-dependent killing","focused glycan","tailor specificity","protein engineering","complexity","SARS-CoV","inhibitory Fc\u03B3RIIb","review touches","affinity","phagocytosis","increased effort","pathogens","relationships","catastrophic adverse effects","small macromolecules","mature appreciation","late stage clinical trials","cytokines","degrees","scaffolding","role","different contexts","efforts","immunoglobulins"],"language":"en"},

METHOD Participants were invited to complete custom developed, pre and post meeting surveys to assess their expectations of and satisfaction with the live virtual format. Speakers and moderators were also invited to complete a custom developed satisfaction survey. The working parties of TROG (head neck/skin, genitourinary, breast and lung) were also sampled. RESULTS In total, 188/273 (69%) registered participants logged in to the live virtual meeting. The online engagement for each of the oral sessions ranged from 53-66%. There were 102 and 57 responders to the online pre and post meeting surveys, respectively. The majority of pre meeting responders indicated a significant level of employer support to attend the virtual meeting. Post meeting satisfaction exceeded pre meeting expectations (\u0027very much\u0027 and \u0027quite a bit\u0027; 86% v 54%; p\u003C0.0001).

METHODS AND RESULTS The study population includes 99 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 4 March and 25 March 2020. Fifty-three patients with a history of cardiac disease were compared with 46 without cardiac disease. Among cardiac patients, 40% had a history of heart failure, 36% had atrial fibrillation, and 30% had coronary artery disease. Mean age was 67 \u00B1 12 years, and 80 (81%) patients were males. No differences were found between cardiac and non-cardiac patients except for higher values of serum creatinine, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity troponin T in cardiac patients. During hospitalization, 26% patients died, 15% developed thrombo-embolic events, 19% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6% had septic shock. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09). The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection as a supportive treatment in the surgical repair of recurrent VVF. Between January 2018 and July 2019, 16 patients with recurrent VVF were injected with PRP in a tertiary gynecological department. Subsequently, a surgical Latzko procedure for VVF closure was scheduled 6-8 weeks after the PRP injection allowing proper neovascularization and remodeling of surrounding tissues. Patients were considered cured if no leakage was observed after surgery and negative dye test results were indicated at follow-up. All patients who were examined therein remained dry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to assess PRP injections as a supporting treatment prior to surgical procedure for recurrent VVF. Preliminary results are encouraging, and we incorporated this method in our clinical practice.

In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods : Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results : Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation \u0026 conclusions : This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadav, Pragya D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Pardeshi, Prachi; Majumdar, Triparna; Balasubramanian, R; Ullas, Padinjaremattathil Thankappan; Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Dighe, Hitesh; Sawant, Pradeep; Patil, Savita; Patil, Dilip; Gokhale, M D; Mathapati, Basavaraj; Sudeep, A B; Baradkar, Sreekant; Kumar, Abhimanyu; Kharde, Rutuja; Salve, Malvika; Joshi, Yash; Gupta, Nivedita; Mourya, Devendra T","journal":"The Indian journal of medical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_795_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rousettus","RNA","NGS"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["Rousettus bats","BtCoV sequences","Indian bats","Pteropus bat specimens","CoV RdRp gene","partial RdRp sequences","representative bat specimens","partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences","Rousettus species","association of Pteropus medius bats","characterization of bat CoV","bat species","SARS-CoV","CoV circulation","Bat samples","RS specimens","throat swab specimens of Pteropus","partial RdRp region","BtCoV HKU9","emerging novel viruses","CoV BtRt-BetaCoV","animal health","Health approach","representative States","public health","human health sectors","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","outbreak potential","epidemic potential","surveillance activities","Representative rectal swab","potential human pathogens","cent identity","cent identical","pathogenic CoVs","presence of CoVs","Phylogenetic analysis","NGS","pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","single-step RT-PCR","collaborative activities","Proactive surveillance","Sanger sequencing","generation sequencing","need","measures","distinct subclustering","complete viral genomes","enhanced screening","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","development of diagnostic assays","Results","Nipah virus","identification","risk mitigation","Methods","disease interventions","conclusions","study","GX2018","Detection","BtCoVs","natural reservoir","Interpretation","past","Background","objectives","recovery"],"language":"en"},

Assessments to inspect the oral cavity have been designed for non-dental healthcare professionals, like nurses. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the content and the measurement properties of oral health assessments for use by non-dental healthcare professionals in assessing older peoples\u0027 oral health, in order to provide recommendations for practice, policy, and research. METHODS A systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE.com, and Cinahl (via Ebsco) has been performed. Search terms referring to \u0027oral health assessments\u0027, \u0027non-dental healthcare professionals\u0027 and \u0027older people (60\u002B)\u0027 were used. Two reviewers individually performed title/abstract, and full-text screening for eligibility. The included studies have investigated at least one measurement property (validity/reliability) and were evaluated on their methodological quality using \u0022The Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments\u0022 (COSMIN) checklist. The measurement properties were then scored using quality criteria (positive/negative/indeterminate). RESULTS Out of 879 hits, 18 studies were included in this review. Five studies showed good methodological quality on at least one measurement property and 14 studies showed poor methodological quality on some of their measurement properties. None of the studies assessed all measurement properties of the COSMIN. In total eight oral health assessments were found: the Revised Oral Assessment Guide (ROAG); the Minimum Data Set (MDS), with oral health component; the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT); The Holistic Reliable Oral Assessment Tool (THROAT); Dental Hygiene Registration (DHR); Mucosal Plaque Score (MPS); The Brief Oral Health Screening Examination (BOHSE) and the Oral Assessment Sheet (OAS). Most frequently assessed items were: lips, mucosa membrane, tongue, gums, teeth, denture, saliva, and oral hygiene. CONCLUSION Taken into account the scarce evidence of the proposed assessments, the OHAT and ROAG are most complete in their included oral health items and are of best methodological quality in combination with positive quality criteria on their measurement properties. Non-dental healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers should be aware of the methodological limitations of the available oral health assessments and realize that the quality of the measurement properties remains uncertain.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Everaars, Babette; Weening-Verbree, Linet F; Jerkovi\u0107-\u0106osi\u0107, Katarina; Schoonmade, Linda; Bleijenberg, Nienke; de Wit, Niek J; van der Heijden, Geert J M G","journal":"BMC geriatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-019-1349-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31900125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMBASE.com","Minimum Data Set","Oral Health Assessment Tool","Hygiene Registration","Oral Assessment Sheet"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measurement properties of oral health assessments","oral health assessments\u0027","oral health component","oral cavity","oral hygiene","Oral Health Assessment Tool","available oral health assessments","included oral health items","older peoples\u0027 oral health","Oral Assessment Sheet","Brief Oral Health Screening Examination","risk reduction of oral","Revised Oral Assessment Guide","selection of health Measurement Instruments","measurement property","Holistic Reliable Oral Assessment Tool","best methodological quality","poor methodological quality","good methodological quality","included studies","positive quality criteria","non-dental healthcare professionals\u0027","general health-related problems","proposed assessments","methodological limitations","Dental Hygiene Registration","ROAG","OHAT","systematic search","COSMIN","systematic review","text screening","Search terms","THROAT","BOHSE","use","tongue","gums","DHR","denture","prevention","MPS","MDS","order","policymakers","researchers","combination","mucosa membrane","early diagnosis","Mucosal Plaque Score","teeth","scarce evidence","saliva","Consensus-based Standards","Minimum Data Set","content","practice","account","abstract","lips","PubMed","recommendations","BACKGROUND Regular inspection","nurses","CONCLUSION","METHODS","checklist","validity","reliability","OAS","Cinahl","reviewers","title","eligibility","purpose","Ebsco","hits"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario\u0027s ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological andeconomic respite for populations.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["restrictive physical distancing","Dynamic physical distancing","BACKGROUND Physical-distancing interventions","substantial physical distancing","base case","restrictive physical-distancing measures","combination of moderate physical distancing","Dynamic interventions","combination of enhanced case","non-ICU","ICU resources","Longer duration interventions","different nonpharmaceutical interventions","credible intervals","epidemic peak","population of Ontario","Ontario population","current estimates of Ontario\u0027s ICU capacity","health-system capacity","health care system","fixed-duration scenarios","Canada","projected occupancy of intensive care unit","median number of cases","year period","coronavirus disease","fixed durations","year time horizon","age-structured compartmental model of COVID","spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","isolation","limited testing","periodic psychological andeconomic respite","quarantine","transmission","following","populations","replicates","burden","beds","present medians","end","height","hospital","course","INTERPRETATION","greatest effect","METHODS","pandemic","proportion"],"language":"en"},

With regard to pathogenicity, S proteins are essential for viral entry into host cells [2, 3]. SARS-CoV binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 which is present on nonimmune cells, such as respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells (renal tubules) and cerebral neurons and immune cells, such as alveolar monocytes/macrophages [4-6]. Of note, CD209L or liver/lymph node special intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (SIGN) and dendritic cell (DC)-SIGN are alternative receptors for SARS-CoV but with lower affinity [7]. In the case of MERS-CoV, S proteins bind to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) which is broadly expressed on intestinal, alveolar, renal, hepatic and prostate cells as well as on activated leukocytes [8]. Then, viruses replicate in target cells with release of mature virions, which, in turn, invade new target cells [9]. Evidence has been provided that SARSCoV proteins are cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, respectively, and the amino acids 318-510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to ACE2 [10, 11]. Quite importantly, in the context of RBD there is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424- 494), which accounts for complete binding to ACE2 [11]. Moreover, by means of two residues at positions 479 and 487 RBD allows virus progression and tropism [10, 11]. In the case of MERSCoV, its RBM binds to DPP4 with residues 484-567, thus, suggesting that its RBD differs from that of SARS-CoV [12, 13]. In a very recent paper, Wan and associates [14] have investigated the receptor recognition by COVID-19 (a new term to indicate the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan) on the bases of structural studies. In this respect, the sequence of COVID-19 RBM is similar to that of SARSCoV, thus, implicating that ACE2 may represent the binding receptors for COVID-19. Furthermore, gln493 residue of COVID-19 RBM seems to allow interaction with human ACE2, thus, suggesting the ability of this virus to infect human cells. According, to Wan and associates structural analysis [14], COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 with a lesser efficiency than human SARS-CoV (2002) but with higher affinity than human SARS-CoV (2003). Furthermore, same authors predicted that a single mutation at the 501 position may enhance the COVID-19 RBD binding capacity to human ACE2 and this evolution should be monitored in infected patients [14]. These predictive findings by Wan and associates [14] are confirmed by two contemporary studies by Letko and Muster [15] and Peng and associates [16]. In particular, the report by Peng and associates [16], points out the possible origin of COVID-19 from bats [16]. From a pathogenic point of view, evidence has been provided that binding of S2 to ACE2 receptor leads to its down-regulation with subsequent lung damage in the course of SARS-CoV infection [17]. Down-regulation of ACE2 causes excessive production of angiotensin (ANG) II by the related enzyme ACE with stimulation of ANG type 1a receptor (AT1R) and enhanced lung vascular permeability [18]. In particular, same authors have reported that recombinant ACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in mice [18]. Moreover, Battle and associates [19] also proposed to use already available recombinant ACE2 for intercepting COVID-19 and attenuating infection. In the previous paragraphs, the presence of ACE2 on immune cells has been pointed out and, by analogy to epithelial cells, this receptor may also be down-regulated following viral entry. Therefore, in CoV-infected animal models and in infected humans further investigations are required to clarify a possible reduced expression of ACE2 on immune cells. In fact, in the course of SARS-CoV infection, a number of immune disorders have been detected. Three reports have demonstrated the ability of CoV to inhibit interferon (IFN)-\uF062 production in the course of SARS acting as IFN antagonist [20-22]. In senescent Balb/c mice, depletion of T lymphocytes is associated to more severe interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV, thus, suggesting a protective role played by these cells [23]. In this connection, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to induce T cell apoptosis, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [24, 25]. Quite interestingly, memory CD8\u002B T cells specific for SARS-CoV M and N proteins have been detected up to 11 years post-infection [26]. As far as humoral immune responsiveness is concerned, evidence has been provided that S1 subunit from MERS-CoV is highly immunogenic in mice [27]. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be highly neutralizing against MERS-CoV replication and endowed with post exposure effectiveness in susceptible mice [28, 29]. Human neutralizing antibodies have also been isolated from a recovered patient, thus, suggesting the role of humoral immunity in the control of the persistence of CoV in the host [30]. In particular, IgG response occurs early in infection and its prolonged production may serve for virus clearance during recovery also in view of the absence of viremia in convalescent sera from SARS patients [31]. According to current literature, severity of COVID-19 infection correlates with lymphopenia and patients who died from COVID-19 had lower lymphocyte counts when compared to survivors [32, 33]. These data suggest that lymphocyte-mediated anti-viral activity is poorly effective against COVID-19. Despite lymphopenia, evidence for an exaggerate release of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6] has been reported in the course acute respiratory syndrome in COVID19 infected patients, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [34]. As recently reported, during COVID-19 pandemic in both Italy and China higher frequency of fatalities have been observed in the frail elderly population with previous comorbidities [35]. It is well known that decline of immunity occurs in ageing and, therefore, COVID-19 may gain easier access to the respiratory tract in frail elderly patients [36]. There is evidence that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and operates as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [18, 37]. It is well known that ANG II via activation of the AT1R promotes detrimental effects on the host, such as, vasoconstriction, reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation and matrix remodelling [38]. ACE2 counterbalances the noxious effects exhibited by ANG II and AT1R via activation of AT2R which arrests cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis [39]. In this framework, Gurwitz [40] proposed to use AT1R blockers, such as losartan, as a potential treatment of COVID-19 infection. In fact, losartan as well as olmesartan, used for treating hypertension in patients, were able to increase ACE2 expression after 28 days treatment of rats with myocardial infarction [41]. Then, Gurwitz suggests to evaluate severity of symptoms in COVID-19 infected patients under previous chronic treatment with AT1R blockers in comparison to COVID-19 infected patients who did not take AT1R blockers [40]. Quite interestingly, 75% of aged COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Italian hospitals had hypertension [unpublished data]. However, the putative effects of ACE-2 down-regulation on the cardiovascular system in the course of COVID-19 pandemic need more intensive studies. Taken together, these evidences suggest that CoV-induced down-regulation of ACE2 activates RAS with collateral damage to organs, such as lungs, in the course of SARS-related pneumonia. Then, putative therapeutic measures aimed at increasing ACE2 levels on respiratory epithelial cells should be taken into serious consideration. Quite interestingly, over the past few years, three key papers have demonstrated the ability of a polyphenol, resveratrol (RES), to experimentally deactivate the RAS system in maternal and post-weaning high fat diet, arterial ageing and high fat diet, respectively [42-44]. In all these experimental models, RES led to an increase of ACE2 with reduction of organ damage, such as liver steatosis and aorta media thickness and decrease of adipose tissue mass, respectively. As far as the mechanism of action of RES is concerned, this polyphenol is able to activate sirtuin (Sirt)1 [45-47]. In turn, Sirt1 down-regulates AT1R expression via ACE2 up-regulation [43, 48]. Of importance, Lin and associates [48] have demonstrated the ability of RES to in vitro inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells, thus, prolonging cell survival in virtue of an anti-apoptotic mechanism. These findings suggest a direct antiviral effect exerted by RES. It would be very interestingly to evaluate the direct effects of RES on COVID-19, in vitro. The data above discussed strongly suggest, that RES, as an activators of ACE2, should be investigated in animal models of CoV-induced severe pneumonia, also taking into account the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects exerted by polyphenols [49]. Then, successful animal studies may pave the way for RES-based human trials in COVID-infected patients. Note added in proof During the reviewing process of this perspective other related papers have been published. Hanff and associates [50] have discussed the possible association between COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality and dysregulation of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). From a pharmacologic point of view, RAS inhibition leads to upregulation of ACE2, thus, attenuating acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis in COVID-19-infected patients. Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture. Such a dilemma would be solved by clinical trials based on RAS blo","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magrone, Thea; Magrone, Manrico; Jirillo, Emilio","journal":"Endocrine, metabolic

The live pathogen vaccine (LPV) strategy, which originated in ancient China for fighting smallpox, has been applied successfully in the USA military recruits for decades to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses. This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV\u0027s safety (SARS-CoV-2 is not highly pathogenic; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV\u0027s safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in hot seasons). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options, and could reduce greatly the morbidity and mortality as well as economic loss caused by the pandemic. The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough cautiousness.

In this study, we identified endolysins ElyA1 and ElyA2 (GH108-PG3 family), present in the genome of bacteriophages Ab1051\u03A6 and Ab1052\u03A6, respectively. The muralytic activity of these endolysins against MDR clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was tested using the turbidity reduction assay. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of endolysin, colistin and a combination of endolysin and colistin were determined, and the antimicrobial activity of each treatment was confirmed by time kill curves. Endolysin ElyA1 displayed activity against all 25 strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa tested and against 13 out of 17 strains of K. pneumoniae. Endolysin ElyA2 did not display any such activity. The combined antimicrobial activity of colistin and ElyA1 yielded a reduction in the colistin MIC for all strains studied, except K. pneumoniae. These results were confirmed in vivo in G. mellonella survival assays and in murine skin and lung infection models. In conclusion, combining colistin (1/4 MIC) with the new endolysin ElyA1 (350 \u00B5g) enhanced the bactericidal activity of colistin in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This will potentially enable reduction of the dose of colistin used in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blasco, Lucia; Ambroa, Anton; Trastoy, Rocio; Bleriot, Ines; Moscoso, Miriam; Fern\u00E1ndez-Garcia, Laura; Perez-Nadales, Elena; Fern\u00E1ndez-Cuenca, Felipe; Torre-Cisneros, Julian; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesus; Oliver, Antonio; Canton, Rafael; Kidd, Tim; Navarro, Ferran; Mir\u00F3, Elisenda; Pascual, Alvaro; Bou, German; Mart\u00EDnez-Mart\u00EDnez, Luis; Tomas, Maria","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64145-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","Endolysin","K. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["MDR","MIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bactericidal activity of colistin","colistin MIC","dose of colistin","combined antimicrobial activity of colistin","Endolysin ElyA2","muralytic activity","new endolysin ElyA1","endolysins ElyA1","combination of endolysin","strains of","Klebsiella pneumoniae","MDR clinical isolates","turbidity reduction assay","Acinetobacter baumannii","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","clinical practice","murine skin","pathogenic bacteria","GH108-PG3 family","MICs","\u00B5g","mellonella survival assays","genome of bacteriophages Ab1051\u03A6","lung infection models","emergence of multidrug resistant","treatment","Minimal inhibitory concentrations","Ab1052\u03A6","value of antimicrobials","course of medical science","time","curves","study","conclusion","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely reported in TBI patients and animal models, and certain miRNAs have been identified as the emerging biomarkers of TBI. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulatory mechanism of TBI remains unclear. To demonstrate the effect of miR-146a mimic on TBI-induced neural damages, TBI mouse model was constructed by cortical impact injury (CCI). The chemokine levels were examined by ELISA assays. Behavioral experiments were used to estimate the impact of miR-146a mimics on neurological functions in mice. Western blot assays were performed to demonstrate the protein levels. qRT-PCR assays were utilized to investigate the expression alteration of RNA levels. It was found that miR-146a was upregulated both in brain and serum in TBI mice. miR-146a mimic downregulated inflammatory cytokines secretion in mouse brain. The NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway was inhibited by miR-146a mimic. miR-146a treatment attenuated the impact caused by TBI to mouse brain and improve the long-term neurological function.

The rivers of the Great Basin (USA) have been particularly imperiled by nonnative species introductions and represent a valuable location to study the dietary trends of native and nonnative fishes in isolated, endorheic systems. We collected fish from 23 sites, spanning three Great Basin watersheds (Carson, Humboldt, and Bear Rivers) and two elevation categories (upland and lowland). Only a single species (speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus) occurred in both elevation zones. Diet item analyses of over 500 fish stomachs indicated significant dietary overlaps between native and nonnative fishes and detailed dietary selectivity for all species. This finding, along with the low species diversity observed in the region, suggests low dietary niche diversity, which could have the potential to amplify the competitive impacts of nonnatives on native species. In upland sites, nonnative trouts were the dominant invaders, while in lowland sites warm-water nonnatives were prevalent. The management implications we recommend based on our results urge for continued monitoring of water temperature and species occurrences to predict if dietary overlaps observed in this study are likely to change in the future.

METHODS Papers were identified by searching Medline and Google Scholar, reference lists/citations and contacting key authors, with no date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: leukaemia, HSCT\u002BTBI, aged \u2264 24 years at HSCT and changes in body composition (total fat, central adiposity, adipose tissue function, muscle mass, muscle function). Quality was assessed using a brief Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS Of 900 papers, 20 were included: seven controlled, five uncontrolled studies and eight case reports. Study quality appeared good. There was little evidence of differences in total fat/weight for HSCT \u002B TBI groups (compared to healthy controls/population norms/short stature controls). There was some evidence of significantly higher central adiposity and differences in adipose tissue function (compared to leukaemic/non-leukaemic controls). Muscle mass was significantly lower (compared to healthy/obese controls). Muscle function results were inconclusive but suggested impairment. Case reports confirmed a lipodystrophic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS Early remodelling of adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle are evident following HSCT \u002B TBI for CTYA leukaemia, with extreme phenotype of overt lipodystrophy. There is some evidence for reduced muscle effectiveness.

This study aimed to quantify the amount of waste in IR packaging and what proportion is recyclable. MATERIALS AND METHODS A range of IR products were weighed using mass scales. Products were assessed for total weight, overall waste, and potentially recyclable waste. Waste was defined as any packaging which was not considered vital to the product to perform its duty and thus was for packaging or shipping purposes. Products were pooled into one of the following categories: catheters and sheaths, wires, needles, devices, coils, and packs/ancillary. RESULTS Seventy-two different products were collected from 26 manufacturers to represent a range of items. The weight of all products was 12,466 g (median 51, range 2-1600), and weight of waste was 6830.7 g (median 34, range 1.1-732). The weight of recyclable waste was 5202.2 g (median 11.5, range 0-701). There were median 2 waste packages per item (range 1-5). The proportion of waste of the overall weight was 54.8% and of this, 76% of all waste was potentially recyclable. CONCLUSION There is a significant burden of waste in manufactured IR products, and while a high proportion is recyclable, we encourage manufacturers of IR products and devices to consider alternative means of transport and packaging of products which will reduce the overall waste burden.

Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus. OBJECTIVES The aim was to assess the effects of quarantine - alone or in combination with other measures - during coronavirus outbreaks. METHODS Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). RESULTS Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be. CONCLUSION Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mayr, Verena; Nu\u00DFbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Gartlehner, Gerald","journal":"Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1164-6611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO Collaborating Centre","Danube University Krems","SARS"],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["modeling studies","studies of SARS","observational studies","simulated quarantine measures","current COVID","BACKGROUND COVID","suspected cases of COVID","quarantine of people","effects of quarantine","nonpharmacological public health measures","best possible balance of measures","limited evidence","pandemic","models","MERS","rapid review","time","coronavirus outbreaks","limited data","important aspects","spread of severe coronavirus diseases","World Health Organization","emerging zoonotic infectious disease","order","benefit","decision makers","Danube University Krems","Centre","effective pharmacological interventions","vaccines","costs","method of systematic reviews","different assumptions","early weeks","Austria","summary","members","German","impact","confidence","focus","combination","outbreak situation","aim","coming months","cost savings","caution","regard","CONCLUSION","METHODS","example","OBJECTIVES","publication","RESULTS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas. Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients. For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed. Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital. Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation.

We conducted a single-arm multicenter phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy for clinical stage I proximal gastric cancer in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality in Korea. The secondary endpoint of this trial was comparison of surgical outcomes among the groups that received different methods of esophagojejunostomy (EJ). METHODS The 160 patients of the full analysis set group were divided into three groups according to the method of EJ, the extracorporeal circular stapling group (EC; n = 45), the intracorporeal circular stapling group (IC; n = 64), and the intracorporeal linear stapling group (IL; n = 51). The clinicopathologic characteristics and the surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the early complication rates among the three groups (26.7% vs. 18.8% vs. 17.6%, EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.516). The length of mini-laparotomy incision was significantly longer in the EC group than in the IC or IL group. The anastomosis time was significantly shorter in the EC group than in the IL group. The time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the IL group than in the EC group. The long-term complication rate was not significantly different among the three groups (4.4% vs. 12.7% vs. 7.8%; EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.359), however, the long-term incidence of EJ stenosis in IC group (10.9%) was significantly higher than in EC (0%) and IL (2.0%) groups (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS The extracorporeal circular stapling and the intracorporeal linear stapling were safe and feasible in laparoscopic total gastrectomy, however, intracorporeal circular stapling increased EJ stenosis.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Han-Kwang; Hyung, Woo Jin; Han, Sang-Uk; Lee, Young-Jun; Park, Joong-Min; Cho, Gyu Seok; Kwon, Oh Kyoung; Kong, Seong-Ho; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Kim, Wook; Ryu, Seung Wan; Jin, Sung-Ho; Oh, Sung Jin; Ryu, Keun Won; Kim, Min-Chan; Ahn, Hye Seong; Park, Young Kyu; Kim, Yong Ho; Hwang, Sun-Hwi; Kim, Jong Won; Kim, Jin-Jo","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07480-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32144557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","IC","IL","EJ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EC group","IL group","IC group","intracorporeal circular stapling group","groups","extracorporeal circular stapling group","intracorporeal linear stapling group","intracorporeal circular stapling increased EJ stenosis","feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy","method of EJ","long-term incidence of EJ stenosis","early gastric cancer","clinical trial","proximal gastric cancer","early complication rates","comparison of surgical outcomes","long-term complication rate","different methods of esophagojejunostomy","clinical stage","anastomosis time","unsolved safety issue","terms of postoperative morbidity","popularity","technical difficulty","significant differences","mortality","multicenter phase","laparotomy incision","length of mini","Korea","secondary endpoint","clinicopathologic characteristics","patients","flatus","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The peculiar irreversible self-alkylation reaction of these enzymes triggered numerous studies, especially on the human homologue, in order to identify effective inhibitors in the fight against cancer. In modern biotechnology, engineered variants of AGTs are developed to be used as protein tags for the attachment of chemical ligands. In the last decade, research on AGTs from (hyper)thermophilic sources proved useful as a model system to clarify numerous phenomena, also common for mesophilic enzymes.

The identification of the mechanisms driving lineage conversion represents a crucial step toward the development of new and more efficient regenerative strategies. To this aim, here we show that pre-treatment with the Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 is sufficient to increase the efficiency of Chemical-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts. PTC-209 induces an overall increase of spontaneously beating iCM at end-stage of reprogramming, expressing high levels of late cardiac markers Troponin T and myosin muscle light chain-2v. The inhibition of Bmi1 expression occurring upon PTC-209 pre-treatment was maintained throughout the reprogramming protocol, contributing to a significant gene expression de-regulation. RNA profiling revealed that, upon Bmi1 inhibition a significant down-regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory signalling pathways occurred, with repression of different genes involved in interleukin, cytokine and chemokine pathways. Accordingly, we observed the down-regulation of both JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway activation, highlighting the crucial role of these pathways as a barrier for cardiac reprogramming. These findings have significant implications for the development of new cardiac regenerative therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Testa, Gianluca; Russo, Michele; Di Benedetto, Giorgia; Barbato, Matteo; Parisi, Silvia; Pirozzi, Flora; Tocchetti, Carlo Gabriele; Abete, Pasquale; Bonaduce, Domenico; Russo, Tommaso; Passaro, Fabiana","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63992-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming","Troponin T","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["direct cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts","adult cardiac fibroblasts","reprogramming protocol","development of new cardiac regenerative therapies","regulation of genes","Bmi1 inhibition","inhibition of Bmi1 expression","Bmi1 inhibitor PTC","significant implications","iCM","significant gene expression de-regulation","chemokine pathways","pre-treatment","high levels of late cardiac markers Troponin T","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","development of therapeutic approaches","inflammatory signalling pathways","crucial role","crucial step","induced-cardiomyocytes","overall increase","repression of different genes","efficient regenerative strategies","myosin muscle light chain","interleukin","MAPK","ERK1","lineage conversion","pathway activation","cytokine","end-stage","efficiency of Chemical","mechanisms","JAK","STAT3","barrier","attractive strategy","injured myocardium","identification","findings","RNA profiling","aim"],"language":"en"},

Hyper-coagulability is indeed a significant issue in COVID-19 and the haemostatic system is shifted markedly towards the procoagulant side in these patients.

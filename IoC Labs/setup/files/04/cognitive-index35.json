Design and setting: Prospective observational study in a medical ICU of a university hospital. Patients: Twenty consecutive patients with septic shock and a cardiac index of 3.5 l/min or higher, started on \u0022low-dose\u0022 hydrocortisone therapy (100 mg bolus, 10 mg/h for 7 days and subsequent tapering) within 72 h of the onset of shock. Measurements and results: Basal total and free plasma cortisol levels ranged from 203 to 2169 and from 17 to 372 nmol/l. In 11 patients cortisol production was considered \u0022inadequate\u0022 because there was neither a response to ACTH of at least 200 nmol/l nor a baseline level of at least 1000 nmol/l. Following the initiation of hydrocortisone therapy total and free cortisol levels increased 4.2- and 8.5-fold to median levels of 3587 (interquartile range 2679\u20135220) and 1210 (interquartile range 750\u20131846) nmol/l on day 1, and thereafter declined to median levels of 1310 nmol/l and 345 nmol/l on day 7.

Conclusions: (a) During proposed regimens of \u0022low-dose\u0022 hydrocortisone therapy, initially achieved plasma cortisol concentrations considerably exceed basal and ACTH stimulated levels. (b) Cortisol concentrations decline subsequently, despite continuous application of a constant dose.

Design and setting: Prospective observational study in pediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients: Twelve infants who were subjected to an uncomplicated diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure were studied. All subjects were ventilated with a volume control mode, 0.3 FIO(2), 4 cmH(2)O PEEP, and 10 ml/kg tidal volume. Volatile (servoflurane) anesthetics were given. Measurements and results: Tracheal aspirates and blood samples were obtained before and after 2 h of mechanical ventilation. In tracheal aspirates and in supernatants of stimulated whole-blood cultures cytokine concentrations were measured. In the tracheal aspirates the immune balance was characterized by a proinflammatory response pattern, with a significant increase in TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 concentrations; concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators remained very low. The functional capacity of peripheral blood leukocytes to produce INF-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1, and IL-6 in vitro was significantly decreased. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the killing activity of natural killer cells. Conclusions: Two hours of servoflurane and mechanical ventilation using a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg is associated with remarkable changes in the immune response in infants without preexisting lung pathology undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the lungs the immune balance favors a proinflammatory response pattern without detectable concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators. The Th1 immune response by peripheral blood leukocytes was decreased. The observed change in Th1/Th2 balance in favor of Th2 cytokine activity may be a systemic adaptation to the proinflammatory milieu in the lung.","publish_time":"2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pl\u00F6tz, Frans B.; Vreugdenhil, Harriet A.; Slutsky, Arthur S.; Zijlstra, Jitske; Heijnen, Cobi J.; van Vught, Hans","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e44d81ef3ec227e938199ab8e6d4ae405e7986da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune balance","Th1 immune response","proinflammatory response pattern","blood cultures cytokine concentrations","infants","Tracheal aspirates","Th2 balance","blood samples","tidal volume","preexisting lung pathology","h of mechanical ventilation","detectable concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators","favor of Th2 cytokine activity","cytokine profile","proinflammatory milieu","functional capacity of peripheral blood leukocytes","TNF-\u03B1","volume control mode","significant increase","significant decrease","hours of servoflurane","uncomplicated diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure","Prospective observational study","killing activity of natural killer cells","pediatric intensive care unit","supernatants of stimulated","systemic adaptation","INF-\u03B3","association","anesthesia","results","university hospital","FIO","observed change","hypothesis","remarkable changes","cmH","Design","Measurements","lungs","O PEEP","anesthetics","Conclusions","subjects","Objective","Patients"],"language":"en"},

Phillyrin (Phil), the main pharmacological component of Forsythia suspensa, possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the effects of Phil on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI have yet to be reported. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of Phil on HS damage and inflammatory signaling pathways in LPS-induced AKI. Results revealed that Phil reduces pathological changes and improves renal function in LPS-induced AKI. Further analysis indicated that Phil effectively protects against glycocalyx HS degradation in LPS-stimulated EA.hy926 cells in vitro and LPS-induced AKI mice in vivo. The protective effect of Phil on HS damage may be associated with the isolate\u2019s ability to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species, and decrease expression levels of cathepsin L and heparanase in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ELISA and Western blot results revealed that Phil inhibits the activation of the NF-\u03BAB and MAPK signaling pathways and decreases the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03B1) in LPS-induced ARDS mice.

Clinical and laboratory data at admission and events within 48 h of admission were collected. Predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The study included 99 patients with a median age of 41 years. Immunodeficiency was present in 60 patients, including 38 with AIDS. Fifty-nine patients had pulmonary TB alone, 22 also had extrapulmonary TB and 18 had miliary. All 99 patients were admitted for acute respiratory failure, some also with shock (20), neurologic disorders (18) or acute renal failure (10). Mechanical ventilation was needed in 50 patients; 22 patients met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day mortality rate was 26.2%.

Conclusion: Delayed clinical suspicion and treatment of active pulmonary TB with respiratory failure may contribute to the persistently high mortality rates in ICU patients with these diseases.","publish_time":"2014-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zahar, Jean-Ralph; Azoulay, Elie; Klement, Elise; De Lassence, Arnaud; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Regnier, Bernard; Schlemmer, Beno\u00EEt; Bedos, Jean-Pierre","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","treatment of active pulmonary TB","acute respiratory failure","predicted mortality","extrapulmonary TB","day mortality rate","high mortality rates","acute renal failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","patterns of pulmonary tuberculosis","predictors","Delayed clinical suspicion","high index of suspicion","year study","h of admission","larger number of lobes","number of organ failures","time","medical intensive care units","criteria","events","symptom onset","ICUs","chest radiograph","laboratory data","Conclusion","shock","ARDS","univariate","Retrospective","neurologic disorders","median age","serum albumin level","chances of early therapy","factors","methods","diseases","multivariate analysis","years","miliary","Immunodeficiency","Mechanical ventilation","month","Results","Objectives","AIDS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into control, LPS, and crocin \u002B LPS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) groups. HUVECs were separated into eight groups: control, crocin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitor (MMP-9 inhib), cathepsin L inhibitor (CTL inhib), LPS, MMP-9 inhib \u002B LPS, CTL inhib \u002B LPS, and crocin \u002B LPS. The potential cytotoxic effect of crocin on HUVECs was mainly evaluated through methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Histological changes were assessed via hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Lung capillary permeability was detected on the basis of wet\u2013dry ratio and through fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: This study showed that crocin can improve the pulmonary vascular permeability in mice with LPS-induced ARDS and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathways of high mobility group box, nuclear factor \u03BAB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. Crocin also protected against the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate and syndecan-4 by inhibiting the expressions of CTL, heparanase, and MMP-9 in vivo and in vitro. Overall, this study revealed the protective effects of crocin on LPS-induced ARDS and elaborated their underlying mechanism. CONCLUSION: Crocin alleviated LPS-induced ARDS by protecting against glycocalyx damage and suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Dong; Qi, Bo-yang; Zhu, Wei- wei; Huang, Xiao; Wang, Xiao-zhi","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9af6a0431067d689a878a185f7a13255f34f2c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CTL","Crocin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Crocin alleviated LPS-induced ARDS","mechanisms of crocin","protective effects of crocin","CTL inhib","mice","potential cytotoxic effect of crocin","MMP","HUVECs","LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells","glycocalyx damage","inflammatory injury","inhibitor","expressions of CTL","control","study","groups","degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate","immunohistochemical staining","protein levels","eosin staining","pulmonary vascular permeability","Lung capillary permeability","fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay","mitogen-activated protein kinase","methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay","pathways of high mobility group box","nuclear factor \u03BAB","Western blot analysis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","lipopolysaccharide","dry ratio","matrix metalloproteinase","syndecan","cathepsin","basis of wet","hemotoxylin","CONCLUSION","immunofluorescence","heparanase","underlying mechanism","Histological changes","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that psoas:lumbar vertebral index (PLVI), a measure of central sarcopenia, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients. METHODS: A query of our institutional trauma registry from 2005 to 2010 was performed. Data was collected prospectively for the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS). Inclusion criteria: age \u003E55 years, ISS \u003E15, and ICU LOS \u003E48 h. Using admission CT scans, psoas:vertebral index was computed as the ratio between the mean cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles and the L4 vertebral body at the level of the L4 pedicles. The 50th percentile of the psoas:L4 vertebral index value was determined, and patients were grouped into high (\u003E0.84) and low (\u22640.83) categories based on their relation to the cohort median. Primary endpoints were mortality and morbidity (as a combined endpoint for PTOS-defined complications). Univariate logistic regression was used to test the association between patient factors and mortality. Factors found to be associated with mortality at p \u003C 0.1 were entered into a multivariable model. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients met the study criteria. Median age was 74 years (IQR 63\u201382), median ISS was 24 (IQR 18\u201329). Patients were 58 % male and 66 % Caucasian. Mean PLVI was 0.86 (SD 0.25) and was higher in male patients than female patients (0.91 \u00B1 0.26 vs. 0.77 \u00B1 0.21, p \u003C 0.001). PLVI was not associated with mortality in univariate or multivariable modeling. After controlling for comorbidities, ISS, and admission SBP, low PLVI was found to be strongly associated with morbidity (OR 4.91, 95 % CI 2.28\u201310.60). CONCLUSIONS: Psoas:lumbar vertebral index is independently and negatively associated with posttraumatic morbidity but not mortality in elderly, severely injured trauma patients.

Many side effects have been observed following radiation therapy with chemotherapy; hence, exploring new treatment modalities for NPC is an important future direction. Angiotensin-(1\u20137) [Ang-(1\u20137)] is an endogenous heptapeptide hormone and important component of the renin\u2013angiotensin system that acts through both the Mas receptor and AT2 receptor, exhibiting anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in cancer cells. However, the anti-cancer activity of Ang-(1\u20137) related to autophagy in NPC remains largely debated. The effects and signaling pathway(s) involved in the Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Ang-(1\u20137) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1\u20137) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway with involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways in vitro study. In addition, pre-treatment with Ang-(1\u20137) inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by inducing autophagy, suggesting a correlation between PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition and the abovementioned anti-cancer activities. However, no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1\u20137) post-treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that Ang-(1\u20137) plays a novel role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviation the incidence of NPC and preventive treatment of recurrent NPC. KEY MESSAGES: Ang-(1\u20137) inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating autophagy. Ang-(1\u20137)pre-treatment inhibits tumor growth via autophagy by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Ang-(1\u20137) may provide a novel preventative treatment for NPC and recurrent NPC.

Antiviral RNAi strategies have received much attention and several compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials. Although induced RNAi is able to trigger profound and specific inhibition of virus replication, it is becoming clear that RNAi therapeutics are not as straightforward as we had initially hoped. Difficulties concerning toxicity and delivery to the right cells that earlier hampered the development of antisense-based therapeutics may also apply to RNAi. In addition, there are indications that viruses have evolved ways to escape from RNAi. Proper consideration of all of these issues will be necessary in the design of RNAi-based therapeutics for successful clinical intervention of human pathogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2007-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haasnoot, Joost; Westerhout, Ellen M; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Nat Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cc87620d704929a550c0971849d423c1dd31ed9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzgyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNAi therapeutics","induced RNAi","design of RNAi","Antiviral RNAi strategies","based therapeutics","infectious diseases","clinical trials","RNA interference","successful clinical intervention of human pathogenic viruses","wide variety of diseases","conserved sequence-specific","double-stranded RNA","specific inhibition of virus replication","cancer","novel nucleic acid","great promise","gene-silencing mechanism","toxicity","delivery","issues","right cells","indications","genetic disorders","attention","development of antisense","evolved ways","Proper consideration","Difficulties","addition","compounds"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the developed assay is to help determine drug use in these areas and also to be a complement to interviewing patients, which will increase reliability of surveys. RESULTS: This assay detects quinine, mefloquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, lumefantrine, chloroquine and its metabolite desethylchloroquine in a 100-\u00B5l dried blood spot. Most of the drugs also have long half-lives that make them detectable at least 7 days after administration. The drugs are extracted from the dried blood spot with sequential extraction (due to the big differences in physicochemical properties), solid-phase extraction is used as sample clean-up and separation is performed with gradient-LC with MS ion-trap detection. CONCLUSION: Detection limits (S/N \u003E 5:1) at 50 ng/ml or better were achieved for all drugs except lumefantrine (200 ng/ml), and thus can be used to determine patient compliance.

We described the viral detection profile and its association with clinical characteristics in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Method Longitudinal observational retrospective study, with patients aged 0\u201318 years, admitted to 11 PICUs in Rio de Janeiro, with suspected H1N1 infection, from June to November, 2009. The results of respiratory samples which were sent to the Laboratory of Fiocruz/RJ and clinical data extracted from specific forms were analyzed. Results Of 71 samples, 38% tested positive for H1N1 virus. Of the 63 samples tested for other viruses, 58 were positive: influenza H1N1 (43.1% of positive samples), rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.4%), respiratory syncytial v\u00EDrus (12.1%), human metapneumovirus (12.1%), adenovirus (6.9%), and bocavirus (3.5%). Viral codetection occured in 22.4% of the cases. H1N1-positive patients were of a higher median age, had higher frequency of fever, cough and tachypnea, and decreased leukometry when compared to H1N1-negative patients. There was no difference in relation to severity outcomes (number of organic dysfunctions, use of mechanical ventilation or amines, hospital/PICU length of stay or death). Comparing the groups with mono-detection and co-dection of any virus, no difference was found regarding the association with any clinical variable. Conclusions Other viruses can be implicated in SARI in children.

A role for nitric oxide in controlling infection remains debatable; thus, we monitored nitric oxide levels in blood and liver of immunized and nonimmunized spf mice during infection by electron paramagnetic resonance. In parallel, liver histology, virus titers, and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity were monitored. Nitric oxide synthesis was barely detectable in BALB/c mice, which showed a progressive increase in virus titers and ALT activity. These animals died with a shorter survival time than A/J mice. The latter displayed a less severe infection and presented detectable levels of nitric oxide as nitrosyl complexes in blood and liver at 72 hpi. Immunized mice from both strains became resistant to MHV-3 and showed comparable levels of nitrosyl complexes in blood and liver at an early time (24 hpi). Thereafter, nitric oxide levels decreased but remained detectable in blood up to 96 hpi. Immunized mice were capable of clearing the virus and clearance was inhibited by administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Overall, the results support a role for nitric oxide in controlling MHV-3 infection.","publish_time":"2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsuhako, Maria H.; Augusto, Ohara; Linares, Edlaine; Dagli, Maria L.Z.; Pereira, Carlos A.","journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3a52f51bb3e6a4eae44465cadb040c58a45ffec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126187.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584906005168; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584906005168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nitric oxide levels","detectable levels of nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthesis","Immunized mice","blood","c mice","J mice","nitric oxide synthase inhibitor","liver of immunized","virus titers","MHV","hpi","nonimmunized spf mice","liver histology","severe infection","comparable levels of nitrosyl complexes","BALB","ALT activity","role","Abstract Murine hepatitis virus","early time","shorter survival time","strain-dependent pattern of disease","plasma alanine aminotransferase","administration","progressive increase","electron paramagnetic resonance","models of resistance","strains","animals","clearance","results","susceptibility"],"language":"en"},

Here, the crystal structures of TYMV PRO/DUB mutants and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an idiosyncratic mobile loop participates in reversibly constricting its unusual catalytic site by adopting \u0022open\u0022, \u0022intermediate\u0022 or \u0022closed\u0022 conformations. The two cis-prolines of the loop form a rigid flap that in the most closed conformation zips up against the other side of the catalytic cleft. The intermediate and closed conformations also correlate with a reordering of the TYMV PRO/DUB catalytic dyad, that then assumes a classical, yet still unusually mobile, OTU DUB alignment. Further structure-based mutants designed to interfere with the loop\u0027s mobility were assessed for enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo, and were shown to display reduced DUB activity while retaining PRO activity. This indicates that control of the switching between the dual PRO/DUB activities resides prominently within this loop next to the active site. Introduction of mutations into the viral genome revealed that the DUB activity contributes to the extent of viral RNA accumulation both in single cells and in whole plants. In addition, the conformation of the mobile flap was also found to influence symptoms severity in planta. Such mutants now provide powerful tools with which to study the specific roles of reversible ubiquitylation in viral infection.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jupin, Isabelle; Ayach, Maya; Jomat, Lucile; Fieulaine, Sonia; Bressanelli, St\u00E9phane","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01a462bf8cf2cd973d1651b991d27c9556d2ae3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5695851.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRO activity","DUB mutants","reduced DUB activity","DUB activities","DUB catalytic dyad","OTU DUB alignment","dual PRO","enzymatic activity","crystal structures of TYMV PRO","viral polyprotein","viral genome","viral infection","mobile flap","closed conformations","idiosyncratic mobile loop","extent of viral RNA accumulation","unusual catalytic site","catalytic cleft","structure-based mutants","rigid flap","active site","positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus","molecular dynamics simulations","ubiquitylated substrates","protein domain","removal of ubiquitin chains","specific roles of reversible ubiquitylation","proteolytic processing","single cells","protease","deubiquitinase","reordering","ovarian tumor","switching","loop\u0027s mobility","Introduction of mutations","symptoms severity","cis-prolines","powerful tools","planta","plants","control","addition"],"language":"en"},

The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present.

The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30\u201335 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD4- and CD8-specific as well as Th1- and Th2-cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th1 vs. Th2, IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1\u2013S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogra, Pearay L.","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d231b91fba188ff3f8be8a8b07ecac455140ce07.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054204900231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054204900231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","J Respir Crit Care"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","development of mucosal disease","human infection","development of extrapulmonary disease","association of RSV","development of wheezing","pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease","development of immune responses","Abstract RSV","importance of RSV","established airway disease","development of bronchial hyperreactivity","Respiratory syncytial virus","mechanisms of mucosal immune responses","reversible reactive airway disease","Primary infections","viral genome","respiratory tract","viral induced cytokines","respiratory mucosa","cyanotic congenital heart disease","significant number of children","Important structural proteins","Th2-cell specific immune responses","mechanisms of pathogenesis","viral penetration","significant attention","Significant progress","primary cause of hospitalisation","enveloped RNA virus","commonest human viral infections","mechanisms of immunity","chemokines","significant booster effect","attachment","reinfection","premature infants","restricted mucosal immunopathology","role of Th1","important model","bronchopulmonary tree","non-structural proteins","years of age","Recurrent wheezing","HIV-infected subjects","frequent association","immunoregulatory cytokines","possible role","current understanding","CD8-specific","Premature babies","negative-sense genome","mild upper tract illness","B cell immunodeficiency states","middle ear","early childhood","intensive immunosuppressive therapy","IgE","certain T","sustained immunologic reactivity","patients","apnoea","croup","strong family history of allergy","asthma","Kimpen JL","recent symposia","historical landmarks","acute otitis media","bone marrow transplant","focus","discovery","serum","fusion","increased mortality","morbidity","spectrum of clinical manifestations","Simoes EAF","weeks of gestation","J Respir Crit Care Med","risk","pneumonia","year of life","treatment","prevention","host cells","S1","selected references","proinflammatory","parts","bronchiolitis","agent","rule symptomatic","addition","CD4","world","sequelae","USA","brief report","S6","birthday","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution. Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population. We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly-sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years. We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns. Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and inter-lineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the US lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments. Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins. We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution. According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, while the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion. Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in coronaviruses emergence. SIGNIFICANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) exhibit a pronounced propensity for interspecies transmission as illustrated by important emerging viruses in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV, as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a major human pandemic. A better understanding of the evolutionary process leading to viral emergence may help unravel the principles of cross-species transmission and therefore assist in preventing future introductions into new host populations. Here, we examined the evolution and spread of an emerging coronavirus that likely transmitted from birds to pigs and caused sustained epidemics in Asia and the United States. We integrated viral full genome sequence analysis and comprehensive surveillance data to examine the evolution of emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and in particular the factors driving ongoing circulation and recent cases in China. We found evidence for adaptive evolution of this emerging virus in the absence of vaccine immune pressure, with important amino acids under positive selection, as well as frequent inter- and intra-lineage recombination events in the Asian lineages. Breeding patterns and ecological environment could play an important role in swine coronavirus evolution, leading to differences in recombination and population diversity. Using phylogeographic approaches, we further shed light on the dispersal history and dynamics of the China lineage of PDCoV. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV in China and suggests that southern China acted as a source of transmission. Modeling how the virus spread in China will allow the prioritization of areas for swine coronavirus surveillance in the future. These findings have important implications for preventing the emergence of coronaviruses in livestock and for controlling their spread in Asian countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Wan-Ting; Ji, Xiang; He, Wei; Dellicour, Simon; Wang, Shilei; Li, Gairu; Zhang, Letian; Gilbert, Marius; Zhu, Henan; Xing, Gang; Veit, Michael; Huang, Zhen; Han, Guan-Zhu; Huang, Yaowei; Suchard, Marc A; Baele, Guy; Lemey, Philippe; Su, Shuo","journal":"Molecular biology and evolution","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","United States","China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["China lineage of PDCoV","dispersal of PDCoV","coronaviruses emergence","emergence of coronaviruses","emerging coronavirus","swine coronavirus evolution","adaptive evolution","epidemiology of PDCoV","geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV","evolution of emerging porcine deltacoronavirus","important emerging viruses","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus","southern China","viral emergence","inter-lineage recombination","distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV","intra-lineage recombination events","important role","emerging enteropathogen of swine","swine coronavirus surveillance","recent SARS-CoV","interspecies transmission","Asian lineages","source of transmission","spread","Middle East respiratory syndrome virus","higher virus genetic diversity","comprehensive surveillance data","important amino acids","human-mediated transmission","US lineage","frequent long-distance dispersal events","dispersal history","important implications","Chinese lineages","recombination breakpoints","SIGNIFICANCE Coronaviruses","genome sequence data","comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data","positive selection","genome sequence analysis","humans","notable South-North transmission","CoVs","deeper understanding","population diversity","geographic circulation patterns","better understanding","integrated analysis","pigs","findings","sequenced viruses","ongoing circulation","sustained epidemics","ecological environments","critical factors","recent cases","S1 subunit","phylogeographic investigations","S2 subunit","future introductions","new insights","phylogeographic approaches","structural mapping","Asian countries","structural proteins","fusion peptide","membrane fusion","Breeding patterns","pig population","new host populations","major human pandemic","absence of vaccine immune pressure","spike protein","MERS","dynamics","differences","shed light","different farming systems","potential sources","animals","evolutionary process","prioritization of areas","pronounced propensity","N-terminal domain","genes","selected sites","ORF1ab gene","principles of cross","birds","United States","worldwide distribution","evidence","livestock","binding","carbohydrate receptor","study","Modeling","years"],"language":"en"},

However, it is common for reports of mouse model studies to lack potentially important information about the microbial status of the mice and the method used to evaluate disease expression for statistical analysis. For example, it is common practice to state that the mice were housed under specific pathogen\u2010free conditions but provide no further information regarding the presence or absence of organisms such as Helicobacter spp. that are known or likely to affect disease expression, thus omitting information potentially important to the expected phenotype of the mice and their responses to experimental manipulation. We therefore encourage authors to use such terms as \u201Cconventional\u201D and \u201Cspecific pathogen\u2010free\u201D precisely, to state the agents from which the mice are represented to be free, and to provide a brief description of the health monitoring protocol. Descriptions of histopathologic methods used to evaluate colitis in mouse models also often do not include sufficient detail to allow readers to understand and evaluate the methods; in addition, the lesions commonly are shown in photomicrographs that are too small and of too low resolution to be interpreted. Inasmuch as such methods are often the major or only source of data upon which conclusions regarding genotype or experimental treatment effects are based, the method employed should be fully described, and photomicrographs should be of adequate size and resolution to allow independent assessment.

ANIMALS: One hundred and two calves with diarrhea. HYPOTHESIS: Oral supplementation with immunoglobulins in calves with diarrhea will reduce time to resolution of diarrhea, number of treatment events, and mortality rate. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Calves were assigned into 1 of 3 groups. The treatment group was supplemented with 20 g of immunoglobulins in milk twice daily for 14 days. The placebo group was supplemented with 20 g of a product with similar nutritional value as the treatment group, but without immunoglobulins, in milk, twice daily for 14 days. The control group received no supplements. Medical treatments, time to resolution of diarrhea, and case fatality rates were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in the proportion of treatment events (treatment, 79% versus placebo, 77% versus control, 71%) among groups (P = .69). The median time to resolution of diarrhea was not different between the treatment (10.5 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7, 13) and control (8 days; 95% CI, 5, 10) groups (P = .08) or between the placebo (6.5 days; 95% CI, 3, 9) and control groups (P = .89).

We also assessed the frequency of selected pairings of codetected pathogens and their clinical characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 576 children (26%) had a coinfection. Children with only virus detected were younger, more likely to be black, and more likely to have comorbidities such as asthma, compared with children infected with typical bacteria alone. Children with virus-bacterium coinfections had a higher frequency of leukocytosis, consolidation on chest radiography, parapneumonic effusions, intensive care unit admission, and need for mechanical ventilation and an increased length of stay, compared with children infected with viruses alone. Virus-virus coinfections were generally comparable to single-virus infections, with the exception of the need for oxygen supplementation, which was higher during the first 24 hours of hospitalization in some virus-virus pairings.

The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. METHODS: A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17(th), 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23\u00B72% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22\u00B78%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38\u00B79% across 4 studies.

It inhibits the replication of many viruses and ultimately promotes apoptosis of infected cells, contributing to the control of virus spread.

Here we unraveled a novel escape strategy involving Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) L* protein. Previously we found that L* was the first viral protein binding directly RNase L. Our current data show that L* binds the ankyrin repeats R1 and R2 of RNase L and inhibits 2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylates (2-5A) binding to RNase L. Thereby, L* prevents dimerization and oligomerization of RNase L in response to 2-5A. Using chimeric mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) expressing TMEV L*, we showed that L* efficiently inhibits RNase L in vivo. Interestingly, those data show that L* can functionally substitute for the MHV-encoded phosphodiesterase ns2, which acts upstream of L* in the OAS/RNase L pathway, by degrading 2-5A.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drappier, Melissa; Jha, Babal Kant; Stone, Sasha; Elliott, Ruth; Zhang, Rong; Vertommen, Didier; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/207885268ef61365fc89820ecb7c854a3dc23d9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5927464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RNase L."],"organizations":["OAS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R2 of RNase","oligomerization of RNase","control of virus","TMEV","viruses","OAS","viral protein binding","Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus","chimeric mouse hepatitis virus","current data","novel escape strategy","range of escape strategies","IFN antiviral response","MHV-encoded phosphodiesterase ns2","effector pathways","ankyrin repeats R1","different steps","apoptosis of infected cells","best","dimerization","replication","oligoadenylates"],"language":"en"},

Although domestic feline hepatozoonosis has since been recorded from Europe, Africa, Asia and America, its description, classification and pathogenesis have remained vague and the distinction between different species of Hepatozoon infecting domestic and wild carnivores has been unclear. The aim of this study was to carry out a survey on domestic feline hepatozoonosis and characterize it morphologically and genetically. METHODS: Hepatozoon sp. DNA was amplified by PCR from the blood of 55 of 152 (36%) surveyed cats in Israel and from all blood samples of an additional 19 cats detected as parasitemic by microscopy during routine hematologic examinations. Hepatozoon sp. forms were also characterized from tissues of naturally infected cats. RESULTS: DNA sequencing determined that all cats were infected with Hepatozoon felis except for two infected by Hepatozoon canis. A significant association (p = 0.00001) was found between outdoor access and H. felis infection. H. felis meronts containing merozoites were characterized morphologically from skeletal muscles, myocardium and lungs of H. felis PCR-positive cat tissues and development from early to mature meront was described. Distinctly-shaped gamonts were observed and measured from the blood of these H. felis infected cats. Two fetuses from H. felis PCR-positive queens were positive by PCR from fetal tissue including the lung and amniotic fluid, suggesting possible transplacental transmission. Genetic analysis indicated that H. felis DNA sequences from Israeli cats clustered together with the H. felis Spain 1 and Spain 2 sequences. These cat H. felis sequences clustered separately from the feline H. canis sequences, which grouped with Israeli and foreign dog H. canis sequences. H. felis clustered distinctly from Hepatozoon spp. of other mammals. Feline hepatozoonosis caused by H. felis is mostly sub-clinical as a high proportion of the population is infected with no apparent overt clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to integrate new histopathologic, hematologic, clinical, epidemiological and genetic findings on feline hepatozoonosis and promote the understanding of this infection. The results indicate that feline infection is primarily caused by a morphologically and genetically distinct species, H. felis, which has predilection to infecting muscular tissues, and is highly prevalent in the cat population studied. The lack of previous comprehensively integrated data merits the redescription of this parasite elucidating its parasitological characteristics.","publish_time":"2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baneth, Gad; Sheiner, Alina; Eyal, Osnat; Hahn, Shelley; Beaufils, Jean-Pierre; Anug, Yigal; Talmi-Frank, Dalit","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a0c165fd5c40909228209e01112875b6d968dea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3639113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587213/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Leucocytozoon","Hepatozoon"],"locations":["India","Europe","Africa","Asia","Spain","Israel"],"keyphrases":["Hepatozoon felis","felis sequences","felis infection","felis infected cats","felis Spain","felis DNA sequences","felis meronts","felis PCR-positive cat tissues","felis PCR-positive queens","Leucocytozoon felis domestici","Hepatozoon canis","Hepatozoon parasite","feline infection","domestic feline hepatozoonosis","Israeli cats","canis sequences","different species of Hepatozoon","cat population","DNA sequencing","muscular tissues","blood samples","study","RESULTS","genetic findings","Genetic analysis","apparent overt clinical manifestations","distinct species","routine hematologic examinations","amniotic fluid","redescription","parasitemic","fetal tissue","lungs of","integrated data merits","America","microscopy","distinction","myocardium","development","lack of previous","possible transplacental transmission","wild carnivores","Asia","classification","pathogenesis","skeletal muscles","Europe","high proportion","merozoites","foreign dog","survey","Africa","outdoor access","predilection","India","understanding","fetuses","parasitological characteristics","significant association","BACKGROUND","forms","METHODS","shaped gamonts","aim","CONCLUSIONS","mammals"],"language":"en"},

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. Methods We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17 to 20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23 to 24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. Conclusions The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Bisong; Qiu, Jingyu; Chen, Haiying; Tao, Vincent; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui","journal":"International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6964c7723c72db63f86d8cd73996f57620c847c3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303556; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425632/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303556?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["epidemic spread","secondary epidemic sources","second-generation spreads","Hubei province","mainland China","Human movements","spatiotemporal data of COVID","q statistics","potential","generations","effect of human movement","interaction influence of first-generation","significant correlations","categories of location","Wuhan city","confirmed cases","spatiotemporal association","data of mobile devices","categories of device trajectories","ongoing control strategies","Urgent control measures","Pearson correlation coefficient","LBS","spatial stratified heterogeneity","based service","outbreak of atypical pneumonia","determinant powers","trend","distance","seafood wholesale market","characteristics","important foundations","Abstract Objectives","novel coronavirus","cities","transfer","provinces adjacent","Conclusions","findings","Results","Bothr","understanding","Methods","associations","critical parameters","time","beginning","global concern","infection"],"language":"en"},

While poorly defined, this hyperinflammatory response results in diffuse alveolar damage. The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: A variety of human in vitro immune models indicate that LMWF5A reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. IMPLICATIONS OF HYPOTHESIS: If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Gregory; Frederick, Elizabeth; Hausburg, Melissa; Goldberg, Laura; Hoke, Marshall; Roshon, Michael; Mains, Charles; Bar-Or, David","journal":"Patient Saf Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb47e8c94320118b492cc8dc76e503db45668faf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220573.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-020-00248-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine storm","immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A","ongoing COVID","efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A","clinical outcomes of COVID","immune response","patients","IMPLICATIONS OF HYPOTHESIS","immunomodulatory effects complimentary","variety of human","potential development","immune models","production of mediators","hyperinflammatory response results","production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","adults","secondary","ARDS","osteoarthritis","restoring homeostasis","ventilation free days","oxygenation parameters","burden","diffuse alveolar damage","safety","common complication of viral pulmonary infections","viable candidate","attenuating hyperinflammation","novel biologic","mortality","findings","therapy","intensive care unit","randomized controlled trial","barrier function of endothelial cultures","review","Food","Drug Administration","BACKGROUND","pandemic","phenomenon","CONCLUSIONS","PRESENTATION","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Built upon this hybrid ARIMA-SVMs models alike, this study goes further to extend them into the case of multistep-ahead prediction for air passengers traffic with the two most commonly used multistep-ahead prediction strategies, that is, iterated strategy and direct strategy. Additionally, the effectiveness of data preprocessing approaches, such as deseasonalization and detrending, is investigated and proofed along with the two strategies. Real data sets including four selected airlines\u0027 monthly series were collected to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empirical results demonstrate that the direct strategy performs better than iterative one in long term prediction case while iterative one performs better in the case of short term prediction. Furthermore, both deseasonalization and detrending can significantly improve the prediction accuracy for both strategies, indicating the necessity of data preprocessing. As such, this study contributes as a full reference to the planners from air transportation industries on how to tackle multistep-ahead prediction tasks in the implementation of either prediction strategy.","publish_time":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ming, Wei; Bao, Yukun; Hu, Zhongyi; Xiong, Tao","journal":"ScientificWorldJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e80ffcae95f83bc7e4353e746ec75187eb61281e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3958729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/567246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction strategy","prediction accuracy","multistep-ahead prediction strategies","hybrid ARIMA-SVMs prediction models","multistep-ahead prediction tasks","long term prediction case","case of short term prediction","case of multistep","direct strategy","hybrid ARIMA-SVMs models","iterated strategy","effectiveness of data preprocessing approaches","necessity of data preprocessing","deseasonalization","detrending","study","unique strength of ARIMA","Real data sets","air transportation industries","air passengers traffic","selected airlines\u0027 monthly series","implementation","planners","reference","nonlinear modeling","advantage","Empirical results","proposed approach"],"language":"en"},

Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of HAIs before and during the SARS outbreak. Such comparison is intended to provide a surrogate measure of the influence that strict enforcement of infection control strategies during the SARS outbreak may have had on the risk of HAIs. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of 400 intensive care patients who were admitted to the ICU three months before and during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Results The rate of HAIs was higher in the pre-SARS period than the SARS period. Specifically, 61.7% of all reported infections were diagnosed in the pre-SARS period. The rate of HAIs in the pre-SARS period was 14.5% as opposed to 9% during the SARS period. Adjusted logistic regression analysis suggested that the odds of HAIs were 2.2 times higher in the pre-SARS period as compared to the SARS period (OR =2.2; 95%CI =1.08\u20134.49). Conclusion Our findings suggest that strict enforcement of infection control strategies may have a positive impact on the efforts to minimise the risk of HAIs. These findings carry a clinical significance that shall not be ignored with regard to our overall efforts to minimise the risk of developing HAIs in the ICU.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Masri, Maher M.; Oldfield, Margaret","journal":"Intensive and Critical Care Nursing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bddb04f1d51d8fc60e8f6068c3bc0c90f5507c18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134889.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964339711000966; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0964339711000966; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2011.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22055396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-SARS period","SARS outbreak","risk of HAIs","rate of HAIs","risk of developing HAIs","odds of HAIs","strict enforcement of infection control strategies","strict adherence","findings","reported infections","ICU","purpose","times higher","spread of healthcare associated infections","positive impact","direct impact","overall efforts","influence","medical records","measurement","cost effective method","intensive care patients","Summary Background","retrospective chart review","surrogate measure","logistic regression analysis","Methods","Conclusion","clinical significance","regard","study","months","comparison","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Point-of-care diagnosis of persistent infection in cats is essential for control of its spread. A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay (RPA-LFD-FHV) combined with a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) was developed that uses human body heat for incubation. Sensitivity was evaluated by testing a serial dilution of a control plasmid, and specificity was evaluated by testing related viruses. Swab samples from cats with suspected infection were tested by RPA-LFD-FHV, and the results were compared to those obtained by PCR to evaluate its clinical performance. The RPA-FLD-FHV assay was carried out successfully within 20 min, using body heat for incubation. The RPA-FLD-FHV had a detection limit of 10(3) copies of the FHV-1 gD gene, which was lower than that of PCR, which was 10(4) copies. The assay could detect templates of FHV-1 but not those of other feline and canine viruses. Viruses in boiled samples could be efficiently detected by the RPA-FLD-FHV. Thirty-one out of the 80 samples were positive by the RPA-FLD-FHV assay, whereas only 27 were positive by PCR. DNA sequencing confirmed that the four samples that were positive by RPA-FLD-FHV but negative by PCR were indeed positive. These results indicate that RPA-FLD-FHV is applicable for clinical use. The RPA-FLD-FHV assay is a simple, rapid, and reliable method for point-of-care diagnosis of FHV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Meng-zhi; Han, Xiao-hu; Yao, Long-quan; Zhang, Wen-kui; Liu, Bao-shan; Chen, Ze-liang","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf3747f8dc2c729cc6d707531dd474ea2ebc222a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30302584/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-4064-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FHV assay","RPA-FLD","templates of FHV","RPA-LFD","care diagnosis of FHV","PCR","Swab samples","boiled samples","suspected infection","care diagnosis of persistent infection","Point","incubation","related viruses","canine viruses","results","copies","human body heat","contagious pathogen of domestic cats","control plasmid","clinical use","clinical performance","Feline herpesvirus type","members","reliable method","recombinase polymerase amplification","specificity","lateral flow dipstrip","serial dilution","gD gene","detection limit","family Felidae","spread","DNA sequencing","Sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe their experiences and share lessons learned regarding triage of patients, staff safety, workforce management, and the psychological impact as they have adapted to a new reality in the Department of Neurosurgery at Montefiore Medical Center, a COVID-19 hot spot in New York City.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ammar, Adam; Stock, Ariel D.; Holland, Ryan; Gelfand, Yaroslav; Altschul, David","journal":"Acad Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f373066459d4576536d06c43f6fb81cf882cb9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304386/; https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Montefiore Medical Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","health care workers","health care resources","staff available","staff safety","triage of patients","new reality","specialty services","New York City","specialty-specific emergencies","Department of Neurosurgery","workforce management","hot spot","Montefiore Medical Center","point of crisis","diverse range of specialties","authors","experiences","lessons","need","pandemic","psychological impact","coverage","Invited Commentary","world","dynamic definition"],"language":"en"},

Host cell factors required for spread of ebolaviruses may serve as targets for antiviral intervention. Lectins, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, Mer), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) proteins, integrins, and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) have been reported to promote entry of ebolaviruses into certain cellular systems. However, the factors used by ebolaviruses to invade macrophages, major viral targets, are poorly defined. Here, we show that mannose-specific lectins, TIM-1 and Axl augment entry into certain cell lines but do not contribute to Ebola virus (EBOV)-glycoprotein (GP)\u2013driven transduction of macrophages. In contrast, expression of Mer, integrin \u03B1V, and NPC1 was required for efficient GP-mediated transduction and EBOV infection of macrophages. These results define cellular factors hijacked by EBOV for entry into macrophages and, considering that Mer and integrin \u03B1V promote phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, support the concept that EBOV relies on apoptotic mimicry to invade target cells.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dahlmann, Franziska; Biedenkopf, Nadine; Babler, Anne; Jahnen-Dechent, Willi; Karsten, Christina B.; Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Schneider, Heike; Wrensch, Florian; O\u0027Callaghan, Christopher A.; Bertram, Stephanie; Herrler, Georg; Becker, Stephan; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02522a1b4512e4d2880a6a551a8dff589d4cb393.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4564540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25877552/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ebolaviruses"],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":["Western Africa"],"keyphrases":["entry of ebolaviruses","EBOV infection of macrophages","cellular factors","driven transduction of macrophages","Host cell factors","TIM","Axl augment entry","certain cell lines","expression of Mer","integrin \u03B1V","NPC1","T cell immunoglobulin","phagocytosis of apoptotic cells","certain cellular systems","efficient GP-mediated transduction","apoptotic mimicry","target cells","major viral targets","mannose-specific lectins","mucin domain","integrins","TAM receptor tyrosine kinases","Tyro3","glycoprotein","proteins","concept","Niemann-Pick C1","public health threat","Ebola virus","contrast","results","Western Africa","antiviral intervention"],"language":"en"},

In one example of this approach, electrospun nylon filters were used to collect MLFs from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The filters were washed to obtain liquid probes, which were then tested for human immunoglobulin A (h-IgA) and fractions of h-IgA specific to ESAT-6 and Psts-1, two antigens secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Probes collected for 10 min contained 100\u20131500 fg of h-IgA and, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, a portion of these h-IgA molecules showed specificity to the secreted antigens. Separate MLFs and their dry residues were successfully collected using an electrostatic collector and impactor developed especially for this purpose. Visualization of MLF dry residues by atomic force microscopy made it possible to estimate the lipid content in each MLF and revealed mucin molecules in some MLFs. This exciting new approach will likely make it possible to detect biomarkers in individual MLFs. MLFs emerging from an infection site (\u2018hot\u2019 microdroplets) are expected to be enriched with infection biomarkers. This paper discusses possible experimental approaches to detecting biomarkers in single MLFs, as well as certain technological problems that need to be resolved in order to develop new non-invasive diagnostics based on analysing biomarkers in separate MLFs.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morozov, Victor N; Mikheev, Andrey Y; Shlyapnikov, Yuri M; Nikolaev, Alexander A; Lyadova, Irina V","journal":"J Breath Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/428b96a4a8eb1738d3952fe0f152a2fe7b7ecc3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MLF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Separate MLFs","single MLFs","individual MLFs","h-IgA molecules","infection biomarkers","IgA specific","fractions of h","MLF analysis","analysing biomarkers","fg of h","pulmonary tuberculosis","Visualization of MLF dry residues","new non-invasive diagnostics","patients","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","secreted antigens","possible experimental approaches","microdroplets of lung fluid","exciting new approach","development of non-invasive lung disease diagnostics","infection site","liquid probes","revealed mucin molecules","electrospun nylon filters","atomic force microscopy","recent improvements","combination of ultra-sensitive assay techniques","portion","instrumentation","exhaled breath","specificity","lipid content","ESAT","impactor","Psts","example","certain technological problems","paper","order","human immunoglobulin","electrostatic collector","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other species of plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium knowlesi. 4. Mixed infections with more than one species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. 5. There are no typical clinical features of malaria; even fever is not invariably present. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints. 6. A diagnosis of malaria must always be sought in a feverish or sick child or adult who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Specific country information on malaria can be found at http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/. P. falciparum infection rarely presents more than six months after exposure but presentation of other species can occur more than a year after exposure. 7. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until more than one blood specimen has been examined. Other travel related infections, especially viral haemorrhagic fevers, should also be considered. 8. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites. P. falciparum and P. vivax (depending upon the product) malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens. RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. 9. Most patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h as patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. In specialised units seeing large numbers of patients, outpatient treatment may be considered if specific protocols for patient selection and follow up are in place. 10. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with an artemisinin combination therapy (Grade 1A). Artemether\u2013lumefantrine (Riamet(\u00AE)) is the drug of choice (Grade 2C) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim(\u00AE)) is an alternative. Quinine or atovaquone\u2013proguanil (Malarone(\u00AE)) can be used if an ACT is not available. Quinine is highly effective but poorly-tolerated in prolonged treatment and should be used in combination with an additional drug, usually oral doxycycline. 11. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized) should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. Severe malaria is a rare complication of P. vivax or P. knowlesi infection and also requires parenteral therapy. 12. The treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria in adults and children is intravenous artesunate (Grade 1A). Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU but is available in many centres. The alternative is intravenous quinine, which should be started immediately if artesunate is not available (Grade 1A). Patients treated with intravenous quinine require careful monitoring for hypoglycemia. 13. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high-dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute kidney injury, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including Gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. 14. Children with severe malaria should also be treated with empirical broad spectrum antibiotics until bacterial infection can be excluded (Grade 1B). 15. Haemolysis occurs in approximately 10\u201315% patients following intravenous artesunate treatment. Haemoglobin concentrations should be checked approximately 14 days following treatment in those treated with IV artemisinins (Grade 2C). 16. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites, stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. 17. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy should be treated with artemether\u2013lumefantrine (Grade 2B). Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy should usually be treated with quinine and clindamycin but specialist advice should be sought. Severe malaria in any trimester of pregnancy should be treated as for any other patient with artesunate preferred over quinine (Grade 1C). 18. Children with uncomplicated malaria should be treated with an ACT (artemether\u2013lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) as first line treatment (Grade 1A). Quinine with doxycycline or clindamycin, or atovaquone\u2013proguanil at appropriate doses for weight can also be used. Doxycycline should not be given to children under 12 years. 19. Either an oral ACT or chloroquine can be used for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria. An oral ACT is preferred for a mixed infection, if there is uncertainty about the infecting species, or for P. vivax infection from areas where chloroquine resistance is common (Grade 1B). 20. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine (1A). Primaquine is more effective at preventing relapse if taken at the same time as chloroquine (Grade 1C). 21. Primaquine should be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. 22. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy and when breastfeeding (until the G6PD status of child is known); after initial treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery or cessation of breastfeeding when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. 23. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lalloo, David G.; Shingadia, Delane; Bell, David J.; Beeching, Nicholas J.; Whitty, Christopher J.M.; Chiodini, Peter L.","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7816bd81dd1dfe3c425f5225014c6b8bfd085d20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132403.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2016.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445316000475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880088/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445316000475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemolysis","IV","Primaquine"],"organizations":["UK","EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Severe falciparum malaria","complicated malaria","diagnosis of malaria","Management of malaria","Plasmodium falciparum","non-falciparum malaria cases","malaria-endemic areas","attendant risks of severe malaria","quarters of reported malaria cases","species of plasmodium","Plasmodium species","typical clinical features of malaria","Plasmodium vivax","falciparum infection","Plasmodium knowlesi","intravenous quinine","Plasmodium ovale","Plasmodium malariae","intravenous artesunate","intravenous therapy","Grade","treatment of choice","oral treatment","outpatient treatment","species of parasite","prolonged treatment","course of treatment","blood films","blood specimen","high proportion of red blood cells","large numbers of patients","adults","high-dependency","children","knowlesi infection","correct diagnostic tests","rapid diagnostic tests","RDTs","Mixed infections","drug of choice","UK","high parasite count","artemisinin combination therapy","parenteral therapy","exposure","year","alternative","travel related infections","optimum diagnostic procedure","gastrointestinal features","specific protocols","additional drug","patient selection","tropical disease","oral doxycycline","Specific country information","life-threatening multi-organ disease","sore throat","examination of thick","lower respiratory complaints","viral haemorrhagic fevers","misleading symptoms","careful monitoring","rare complication of","intensive care environment","expert","specialised units","hypoglycemia","hospital","dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine","sick child","speciate","atovaquone","proguanil","Malarone","months","presentation","awareness","malarial parasites","plasmodial antigens","Artemether","lumefantrine","Riamet","Eurartesim","centres","product","place","deaths","ACT","severe malaria","uncomplicated malaria","Uncomplicated falciparum malaria","treatment of non-falciparum malaria","acute attack of malaria","trimester of pregnancy","primaquine","vivax infection","initial treatment","line treatment","ovale infection","quinine","eradication of hypnozoites","intravenous artesunate treatment","severe haemolysis","Children","chloroquine resistance","bacterial infection","mixed infection","ovale hypnozoites","oral ACT","severe intercurrent infections","weekly chloroquine prophylaxis","effective drug","placenta","patients","artemether","clindamycin","hypnozoite eradication","Dormant parasites","doxycycline","acute kidney injury","high levels of parasites","acute respiratory distress syndrome","future visits","effective anti-mosquito precautions","early delivery","future attacks","endemic areas","cessation of breastfeeding","G6PD status of child","intravascular coagulation","chemoprophylaxis","seizures","pregnant woman","Glucose","management","empirical broad spectrum antibiotics","stillbirth","Gram-negative bacteraemia","protection","phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency","appropriate doses","expert supervision","septicaemia","uncertainty","diagnosis","individuals","time","haemodynamic support","infecting species","weight","specialist advice","relapse","artemisinins","blood","days","Haemoglobin concentrations","years"],"language":"en"},

JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a ubiquitous constituent of the human virome. With altered immunological status, JCPyV can cause the oft-fatal brain demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). JCPyV is a human-only pathogen. Using the mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) encephalitis model, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells regulate development of functional antiviral brain-resident CD8 T cells (bT(RM)) and renders their maintenance refractory to systemic CD8 T cell depletion. Acquired CD4 T cell deficiency, modeled by delaying systemic CD4 T cell depletion until MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells have infiltrated the brain, impacted the stability of CD8 bT(RM), impaired their effector response to reinfection, and rendered their maintenance dependent on circulating CD8 T cells. This dependence of CD8 bT(RM) differentiation on CD4 T cells was found to extend to encephalitis caused by vesicular stomatitis virus. Together, these findings reveal an intimate association between CD4 T cells and homeostasis of functional bT(RM) to CNS viral infection.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mockus, Taryn E.; Shwetank,; Lauver, Matthew D.; Ren, Heather M.; Netherby, Colleen S.; Salameh, Tarik; Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura; Yue, Feng; Broach, James R.; Lukacher, Aron E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ceba28d8304f3df8001164f8edeef545154289f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6224182.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372487/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD4 T cells","circulating CD8 T cells","durable T","MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells","CD4 T cell deficiency","systemic CD8 T cell depletion","systemic CD4 T cell depletion","Tissue-resident memory CD8 T","development of functional antiviral brain-resident CD8 T cells","stability of CD8 bT","dependence of CD8 bT","JCPyV","cell responses","homeostasis of functional bT","fatal brain","mucosal barriers","maintenance dependent","maintenance refractory","encephalitis model","mouse polyomavirus","JC polyomavirus","human virome","non-mucosal tissues","determinants","disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","differentiation","microbial reinfections","intimate association","ubiquitous constituent","PML","opportunistic persistent pathogens","CNS viral infection","vesicular stomatitis virus","altered immunological status","findings","effector response"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, human activities beyond agriculture have often driven the emergence of diseases. The more that humans expand the footprint of the global population, encroach into natural habitats, alter these habitats to extract resources and intensify food production, as well as move animals, people and commodities along with the pathogens they carry, the greater the potential for pathogens and pests to spread and for infection to emerge or re\u2010emerge. While essential to human well\u2010being, producing food also plays a major role in disease dynamics. The risk of emergence of pests and pathogens has increased as a consequence of global changes in the way food is produced, moved and consumed. Climate change is likely to increase pressure on the availability of food and provide newly suitable conditions for invasive pests and pathogens. Human population displacements due to economic, political and humanitarian crises represent another set of potential drivers for emerging issues. The overlapping drivers of plant, animal and human disease emergence and environmental changes point towards the concept of \u2018One Health\u2019. This paradigm underlines the urgent need to understand the influence of human behaviour and incorporate this understanding into our approach to emerging risks. For this, we face two major challenges. One is cultural; the second is methodological. We have to look at systems not under the narrow view of specific hazards but with a wider approach to system dynamics, and consider a broad spectrum of potential outcomes in terms of risk. In addition, we have to make sense of the vast amounts of data that are available in the modern age. This paper aims to help in preparing for the cultural and methodological shifts needed in our approach to emerging risks.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richardson, Jane; Lockhart, Caryl; Pongolini, Stefano; Karesh, William B.; Baylis, Matthew; Goldberg, Tony; Slingenbergh, Jan; Gale, Paul; Venturini, Tommaso; Catchpole, Mike; de Balogh, Katinka; Pautasso, Marco; Broglia, Alessandro; Berthe, Franck; Schans, Jan; Poppy, Guy","journal":"EFSA J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04908565dc76425cc6a3fabc1dff0bce3860e3c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163467.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.s0512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogens","human disease emergence","human activities","human well\u2010being","Human population displacements","disease dynamics","availability of food","way food","food production","risk of emergence","emerging risks","influence of human behaviour","plant disease events","set of potential drivers","wider approach","global population","invasive pests","major consequences","emerging issues","major role","emergence of diseases","major challenges","humans","overlapping drivers of plant","consequence of global changes","broad spectrum of potential outcomes","environmental changes","system dynamics","natural habitats","terms of risk","history of agriculture","methodological shifts","humanitarian crises","suitable conditions","pressure","understanding","narrow view of specific hazards","vast amounts of data","sense","urgent need","animals","Climate change","concept","people","commodities","sector","resources","footprint","time","modern age","paradigm","systems","Health","addition","infection","paper"],"language":"en"},

The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder\u00AE SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 \u00B1 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hattoufi, Kenza; Tligui, Houssain; Obtel, Majdouline; El Ftouh, Sobha; Kharbach, Aicha; Barkat, Amina","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e0925a800d4d09380ac44584b5be257d83531d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7049438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32148499/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6212643","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mai"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial viruses","majority of acute respiratory tract infections","clinical spectrum of respiratory infections","etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections","respiratory distress isolated","severe respiratory symptoms","use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction","multiplex RespiFinder","clinical results of pediatric pneumonia","fast identification","infants","multiple viruses","bacteria","Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests","overall use of unnecessary antibiotics","Study design","molecular diagnosis","influenza H1N1","fast detection of related causative agents","routine setting","intestinal flora","systemic signs","serious public health problem","days","viral origin","nosocomial infection","accurate treatment","Tracheal secretion","Morocco","etiology","mean age","cause of mortality","infectious diseases","unit of Neonatology","paper","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","length of hospitalization","coronaviruses","parainfluenza virus type","patients","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","humain metapneumovirus","Samples","Coinfections","rhinovirus","adenovirus","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection was 12.52% (95% CI: 9.78\u201315.26%), and the epidemic peak occurred in autumn. Fifty partial S and 40 partial N fragments were obtained from these patients. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbour-joining method showed that at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains were circulating among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. In addition, some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 were found in the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, consensus amino acids substitutes for each cluster were also found after alignment of partial S or N sequence coding region in this study. In conclusion, we herein describe the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among adult patients and provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 circulating in Beijing.","publish_time":"2014-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Qin; Lu, Roujian; Peng, Kun; Duan, Xijie; Wang, Yanqun; Zhao, Yanjie; Wang, Wen; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff77d5ebc39274bb7729f2b5261bca574bdfd6a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4079595.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987849/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Partial S"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 infection","HCoV-OC43 strains","prevalence of HCoV","adult patients","N genes of HCoV","genetic diversity of HCoV","Beijing","alignment of partial S","genetic diversity of human coronavirus OC43","partial N fragments","ARI","phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic trees","N sequence coding region","amino acid alignment","distinct clusters","novel unique clusters","consensus amino acids substitutes","different OneStep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","acute respiratory infections","substantial evidence","epidemiology","UNT","method","study","nasopharyngeal swab samples","assays","addition","neighbour","epidemiological profiles","epidemic peak","autumn","results","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A total of 150 patients (110 males, 40 females) were studied and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to M. pneumoniae were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and PCR amplification was performed for the P1 gene to associate M. pneumoniae infection with asthma. As compared with 33 children with asthma, only two of the control subjects had positive IgM titers for M. pneumoniae, which was statistically significant (P=0.002). A total of 15 children with asthma were positive by PCR for the P1 gene while none of the controls had a positive PCR. Of these positive cases, 24 cases were positive only by ELISA, six were positive only by PCR and nine patients were found to be positive by both ELISA and PCR. All the clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were comparable between the moderate and the severe group of patients statistically, except for the peak expiratory flow rate. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found to have a significant association with acute exacerbation in the moderate group of asthma patients by PCR (P=0.01).

Cocultivation of the BPV-transformed cell lines with FIPV-permissive feline fcwf-D cells resulted in polykaryocyte formation. Since it depended on the presence of fcwf-D cells, binding of E2 to the cell receptor may be required for membrane fusion. E2 was synthesized as a core-glycosylated protein of 180K which was only slowly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi: of the E2-molecules labeled during a 1-hr pulse about half was still completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H after a 2-hr chase, while the remaining E2 had been chased into multiple, partially endoglycosidase H-resistant forms.

LRD has been used to identify potential treatments or preventative actions for challenging medical problems, among myriad other applications. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first pandemic of the 21st century. SARS was eventually controlled through increased hygienic measures (e.g., face mask protection, frequent hand washing, living quarter disinfection), travel restrictions, and quarantine. According to recent reviews of SARS, none of the drugs that were used during the pandemic worked. For the present paper, SARS was selected as the first application of LRD to an infectious disease. The main goal of this research was to identify non-drug non-surgical treatments that would 1) prevent the occurrence, or 2) reduce the progression rate, or 3) stop/reverse the progression of SARS. The MeSH taxonomy of Medline was used to restrict potential discoveries to selected semantic classes, and to identify potential discoveries efficiently. To enhance the volume of potential discovery, databases were used in addition to Medline. These included the Science Citation Index (SCI) and, in contrast to previous work, a full text database. Because of the richness of the full text, \u2018surgical\u2019 queries were developed that targeted the exact types of potential discovery of interest while eliminating clutter more efficiently.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kostoff, Ronald N.","journal":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d09c4b9dbb5ea4eaa95a237773f90bc9f637741e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118796.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162511000746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287410/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2011.03.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162511000746","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Medline"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential treatments","potential discoveries","volume of potential discovery","progression of SARS","exact types of potential discovery","recent reviews of SARS","application of LRD","pandemic","non-drug non-surgical treatments","Abstract Literature-related discovery","text database","progression rate","MeSH taxonomy of Medline","face mask protection","frequent hand washing","challenging medical problems","quarter disinfection","preventative actions","novel","research","intelligible connections","databases","increased hygienic measures","semantic classes","order","travel restrictions","previous work","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","disjoint concepts","Science Citation Index","contrast","applications","infectious disease","queries","addition","linking","main goal","quarantine","present paper","drugs","clutter","century","richness","occurrence"],"language":"en"},

In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (\u2014) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3\u2032 terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5\u2032 end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.","publish_time":"1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Total pneumococcal densities (encompassing all present serotypes) during asymptomatic periods were significantly higher when a respiratory virus was detected versus when no virus was detected (p\u003C0.001). In adjusted analyses, increased pneumococcal density was significantly associated with the risk for a subsequent ARI (p\u003C0.001), whereas asymptomatic viral detection alone was associated with lower risk for subsequent ARI.

We evaluated the frequency and impact of ARI and influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes on disease activity, and the immunogenicity and safety of influenza vaccine in a cohort of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. METHODS: Surveillance of respiratory viruses was conducted in JIA patients during ARI season (March to August) in two consecutive years: 2007 (61 patients) and 2008 (63 patients). Patients with ARI or ILI had respiratory samples collected for virus detection by real time PCR. In 2008, 44 patients were immunized with influenza vaccine. JIA activity index (ACRPed30) was assessed during both surveillance periods. Influenza hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured before and 30-40 days after vaccination. RESULTS: During the study period 105 ARI episodes were reported and 26.6% of them were ILI. Of 33 samples collected, 60% were positive for at least one virus. Influenza and rhinovirus were the most frequently detected, in 30% of the samples. Of the 50 JIA flares observed, 20% were temporally associated to ARI. Influenza seroprotection rates were higher than 70% (91-100%) for all strains, and seroconversion rates exceeded 40% (74-93%). In general, response to influenza vaccine was not influenced by therapy or disease activity, but patients using anti-TNF alpha drugs presented lower seroconversion to H1N1 strain. No significant differences were found in ACRPed30 after vaccination and no patient reported ILI for 6 months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: ARI episodes are relatively frequent in JIA patients and may have a role triggering JIA flares. Trivalent split influenza vaccine seems to be immunogenic and safe in JIA patients.","publish_time":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho, Luciana M; de Paula, Fl\u00E1via E; Silvestre, Rodrigo V D; Roberti, Luciana R; Arruda, Eurico; Mello, Wyller A; Ferriani, Virginia P L","journal":"Pediatr Rheumatol Online J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11855c4ce9640d35da8dd4c54e913843a41c9252.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3602114.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1546-0096-11-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI","JIA"],"organizations":["ILI","ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JIA patients","ARI episodes","safety of influenza vaccine","ILI","impact of ARI","ARI season","JIA activity index","Influenza seroprotection rates","Trivalent split influenza vaccine","respiratory samples","vaccination","role triggering JIA flares","disease activity","Influenza hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers","Surveillance of respiratory viruses","ACRPed30","seroconversion rates","Acute respiratory infections","lower seroconversion","virus detection","surveillance periods","anti-TNF alpha drugs","cohort of juvenile idiopathic arthritis","immunogenicity","illness","therapy","H1N1 strain","real time PCR","study period","BACKGROUND","METHODS","complications","months","response","CONCLUSION","frequency","children","significant differences","chronic diseases","RESULTS","strains","consecutive years","days","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

Concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of 0.8 \u03BCm, 5 \u03BCm, and 16 \u03BCm as well as tracer gas were numerically studied in the Eulerian frame. Two indexes, i.e. intake fraction (IF) and concentration uniformity index R C were introduced to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. It was found that without PV, DV performed best concern protecting the exposed manikin from the pollutants exhaled by the polluting manikin. In MV when the exposed manikin opened RMP the inhaled air quality could always be improved. In DV and UFAD application of RMP might sometimes, depending on the personalized airflow rate, increase the exposure of the others to the exhaled droplets of tracer gas, 0.8 \u03BCm particles, and 5 \u03BCm particles from the infected occupants. Application of PV could reduce R C for all the three TV systems of 0.8 \u03BCm and 5 \u03BCm particles. PV enhanced mixing degree of particles under DV and UFAD based conditions much stronger than under MV based ones. PV could increase the average concentration in the occupied zone of the exposed manikin as well as provide clean personalized airflow. Whether inhaled air quality could be improved depended on the balance of pros and cons of PV.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Qibin; Niu, Jianlei; Gao, Naiping; Zhu, Tong; Wu, Jiazheng","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c4bc10401c2c39f1a8afa70aa350323adc2b1d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119025.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132310002465; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132310002465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MV","UFAD","RMP","PV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCm particles","DV","Application of PV","ventilation strategies","exposed manikin","displacement ventilation","cons of PV","type of personalized ventilation","Concentrations of particles","performance of ventilation systems","MV","UFAD application of RMP","background ventilation methods","mixing degree of particles","polluting manikin","inhaled air quality","TV systems","exhaled droplets of tracer gas","clean personalized airflow","personalized airflow rate","concentration uniformity index R C","under-floor air distribution","average concentration","seated occupants","infected occupants","office room","transmission of respiratory droplets","device","round movable panel","different total volume","occupied zone","conditions","best concern","aerodynamic diameters","exposure","pollutants","intake fraction","paper","balance of pros","indexes","ones","Eulerian frame"],"language":"en"},

This \u2018position effect\u2019 is seen in cases where a mutation creates an AUG codon upstream from the normal start site and translation shifts to the upstream site. The position effect is evident also in cases where a silent internal AUG codon is activated upon being relocated closer to the 5\u2032 end. Two mechanisms for escaping the first-AUG rule \u2013 reinitiation and context-dependent leaky scanning \u2013 enable downstream AUG codons to be accessed in some mRNAs. Although these mechanisms are not new, many new examples of their use have emerged. Via these escape pathways, the scanning mechanism operates even in extreme cases, such as a plant virus mRNA in which translation initiates from three start sites over a distance of 900 nt. This depends on careful structural arrangements, however, which are rarely present in cellular mRNAs. Understanding the rules for initiation of translation enables understanding of human diseases in which the expression of a critical gene is reduced by mutations that add upstream AUG codons or change the context around the AUGSTART codon. The opposite problem occurs in the case of hereditary thrombocythemia: translational efficiency is increased by mutations that remove or restructure a small upstream open reading frame in thrombopoietin mRNA, and the resulting overproduction of the cytokine causes the disease. This and other examples support the idea that 5\u2032 leader sequences are sometimes structured deliberately in a way that constrains scanning in order to prevent harmful overproduction of potent regulatory proteins. The accumulated evidence reveals how the scanning mechanism dictates the pattern of transcription \u2013 forcing production of monocistronic mRNAs \u2013 and the pattern of translation of eukaryotic cellular and viral genes.","publish_time":"2002-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kozak, Marilyn","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97c78798cc75c9da5716e5c6e7c61f8b703ccadf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126118.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111902010569; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111902010569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["scanning mechanism","upstream site","initiation of translation","pattern of translation","eukaryotic mRNAs","cellular mRNAs","translation initiates","translation shifts","AUGSTART codon","translational initiation site","normal start site","context-dependent leaky scanning","extreme cases","start sites","mutations","production of monocistronic mRNAs","codons","new examples","position effect","mechanisms","small upstream open reading frame","thrombopoietin mRNA","translational efficiency","resulting overproduction","pattern of transcription","plant virus mRNA","harmful overproduction of potent regulatory proteins","case of hereditary thrombocythemia","order","reinitiation","expression","Abstract Selection","viral genes","dominant role","human diseases","idea","critical gene","cytokine","escape pathways","accumulated evidence","proximity","opposite problem","careful structural arrangements","leader sequences","distance","use","rules"],"language":"en"},

The overall positive rate (47%) was about twice higher than previous reports based on conventional methods. Influenza A, parainfluenza and RSV accounted for 51%, and non\u2010cultivable viruses accounted for 30% of positive cases. Influenza A peaked at March and June. Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Most RSV infections were found between February and September. Adenovirus had multiple peaks, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring. RSV infection was associated with bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza was associated with croup; otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific. In general, children infected with influenza A, adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures.

Accordingly, we identified a number of novel RNA viruses including astrovirus, rotavirus A, picorna-like virus and a narmovirus (paramyxovirus). In addition, we identified a sobemovirus and a novel luteovirus that likely originated from the rabbit diet. These newly discovered viruses were often divergent from those previously described. The novel astrovirus was most closely related to a virus sampled from the rodent-eating European roller bird (Coracias garrulous). PCR screening revealed that the novel narmovirus in the UK field vole had a prevalence of approximately 4%, and shared common ancestry with other rodent narmoviruses sampled globally. Two novel rotavirus A sequences were detected in a UK field vole and a French rabbit, the latter with a prevalence of 5%. Finally, a highly divergent picorna-like virus found in the gut of the French rabbit virus was only ~35% similar to an arilivirus at the amino acid level, suggesting the presence of a novel viral genus within the Picornaviridae.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Chappell, Joseph G.; Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Umhang, G\u00E9rald; Shi, Mang; Bennett, Malcolm; Tarlinton, Rachael E.; McClure, C.

The mechanisms that determine the age-dependent susceptibility remain largely unclear. Here, we found that the paucity of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells together with immaturity of the immune system was related to the susceptibility of neonatal mice to EV71 infection. iNKT cells were crucial antiviral effector cells to protect young mice from EV71 infection before their adaptive immune systems were fully mature. EV71 infection led to activation of iNKT cells depending on signaling through TLR3 but not other TLRs. Surprisingly, iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required TLR3 signaling in macrophages, but not in dendritic cells (DCs). Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-12 and endogenous CD1d-restricted antigens were both required for full activation of iNKT cells. Furthermore, CD1d-deficiency led to dramatically increased viral loads in central nervous system and more severe disease in EV71-infected mice. Altogether, our results suggest that iNKT cells may be involved in controlling EV71 infection in children when their adaptive immune systems are not fully developed, and also imply that iNKT cells might be an intervention target for treating EV71-infected patients.","publish_time":"2015-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Kai; Yang, Juhao; Luo, Kaiming; Yang, Chunhui; Zhang, Na; Xu, Ruifeng; Chen, Jianxia; Jin, Mingfei; Xu, Bin; Guo, Nining; Wang, Jianrong; Chen, Zuolong; Cui, Ying; Zhao, Hui; Wang, Yan; Deng, Chaoyang; Bai, Li; Ge, Baoxue; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Shen, Hao; Yang, Chun-Fu; Leng, Qibin","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f199e77d2c967c1f6e88fa846134b0ffec1cf5dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4304831.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25615690/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 infection","activation of iNKT cells","dendritic cells","EV71-infected mice","EV71-infected patients","iNKT cell activation","crucial antiviral effector cells","adaptive immune systems","young mice","susceptibility of neonatal mice","children","TLR3","severe disease","mouth disease","CD1d-deficiency","central nervous system","age-dependent susceptibility","endogenous CD1d-restricted antigens","hand","paucity of invariant natural killer T","intervention target","viral loads","foot","macrophages","enteroviruses","virulent pathogen","immaturity","mechanisms","adults","DCs","results","interleukin","TLRs"],"language":"en"},

However, their successful use in China, South Korea and the Czech Republic has encouraged their widespread use, and the shortage that already existed. This has caused that companies and individuals are looking at the best way to reuse them, and to manufacture, homemade or not, of non-certified masks. This paper is based on two objectives: to consult the scientific literature to identify the main strategies for disinfecting them, and to determine the effectiveness of non-certified disposable masks. A rapid review has been conducted in which the main publications and other information available online have been analyzed. Results showed that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam are not fully recommended.

However, cisplatin often loses effectiveness because most tumors acquire drug resistance over time. As EGFR is the most important pro-survival/proliferation signal receptor in NSCLC cells, we aimed at investigating whether cisplatin resistance is related to EGFR activation and further evaluating the combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib (EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI) on cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EGFR activation was analysed in parental and cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines (H358 and H358(R), A549 and A549(R)). Cellular proliferation and apoptosis of H358(R)/A549(R) cells treated with cisplatin or gefitinib, alone or in combination were investigated, and the related effector protein was detected by western blot analysis. Anti-tumor effect of two drugs combined was evaluated in animal models of H358(R) xenografts in vivo. RESULTS: EGFR was significantly phosphorylated in cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells H358(R) and A549(R) than their parental cells. In H358(R) and A549(R) cells, anti-proliferative ability of gefitinib was further improved, and gefitinib combined with cisplatin enhanced inhibition of cellular survive/proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis in vitro. The combined effects were also associated with the inhibition of EGFR downstream effector proteins. Similarly, in vivo, gefitinib and cisplatin in combination significantly inhibited tumor growth of H358(R) xenografts. CONCLUSION: Abnormal activation of EGFR may induce wtEGFR NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin. The combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib suggest that gefitinib, as a combination therapy for patients with cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC should be considered.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Amin; Cao, Weiya; Liu, Xueke; Zhang, Yinci; Ma, Yongfang; Xu, Ruyue; Zhang, Rongbo; Liu, Xinkuang; Zhou, Shuping; Wang, Ruikai; Liu, Jiachang; Tang, Xiaolong","journal":"J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a77f5d9dfd36f52d244025b6c0878146ffaf3d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185832.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342201/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-020-03228-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cisplatin resistance","cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells H358","combined effects of cisplatin","EGFR activation","cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines","type EGFR","EGFR-TKI","cisplatin-based chemotherapy","A549","wtEGFR NSCLC cell resistance","apoptosis of H358","cisplatin enhanced inhibition of cellular","Abnormal activation of EGFR","parental cells","EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor","animal models of H358","inhibition of EGFR downstream effector proteins","inhibited tumor growth of H358","anti-proliferative ability of gefitinib","Cellular proliferation","combination therapy","drug resistance","xenografts","proliferation signal receptor","Anti-tumor effect","related effector protein","promotion of apoptosis","non-small cell lung cancer","important pro-survival","line strategy of wild","patients","drugs","tumors","western blot analysis","effectiveness","time","MATERIALS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The open reading frames of cathepsin H appeared to encode a protein of 326-amino acid residues, which that of cathepsin L encoded a protein of 336 amino acids. The degree of conservation of the channel catfish cathepsin H and L amino acid sequences in comparison to other species ranged from 61% to 77%, and 67% to 85%, respectively. The catalytic triad and substrate binding sites are conserved in cathepsin H and L amino acid sequences.

We will describe the current situation. Observations Infectious agents are carried by means of travellers, immigrants, as well as by animals, goods and merchandise. The distribution of infections potentially responsible for epidemics tends to become worldwide and some of them are emergent diseases. Solutions Such a situation imposes enhancement of international surveillance and development of resources for control and response to alerts. Developed countries possess most advanced equipments and interventional structures: they are those which may intervene predominantly in the fight against epidemics. The necessary contribution of these industrialized countries is increasing in developing countries in which infectious epidemics are spreading and such intervention must be sustained.

However, there are also a plethora of animal coronaviruses, which have the potential to cross the species border. This regularly results in the emergence of new viruses in humans. In 2002 SARS-CoV emerged, to rapidly disappear in May 2003. In 2012 MERS-CoV was identified as a possible threat to humans, but its pandemic potential so far is minimal, as the human-to-human transmission is ineffective. The end of 2019 brought us information about the SARS-CoV-2 emergence, and the virus rapidly spread in 2020 causing an unprecedented pandemic.At present, the studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line. This model is convenient for diagnostics, but it has serious limitations and does not allow for the understanding of virus biology and evolution.Here we show that fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures constitute an excellent model to study the infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We observed an efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with the maximal replication at 2 days post-infection. The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds.

Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5\u2032-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032UTR were predicted.

The E and 3b protein products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that the mutations in the 5\u2032UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer.

Severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases, including poliomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis. Enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes. The large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially, but not fully, explained by differences in tissue tropism. The molecular mechanisms by which enteroviruses cause disease are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that the two enteroviral proteases, 2A(pro) and 3C(pro), are important mediators of pathology. These proteases perform the post\u2010translational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, but they also cleave several host\u2010cell proteins in order to promote the production of new virus particles, as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses. Enterovirus\u2010associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology, as elegantly demonstrated by the 2A(pro)\u2010mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes contributing to Coxsackievirus\u2010induced cardiomyopathy. It is likely that improved tools to identify targets for these proteases will reveal additional host protein substrates that can be linked to specific enterovirus\u2010associated diseases. Here, we discuss the function of the enteroviral proteases in the virus replication cycle and review the current knowledge regarding how these proteases modulate the infected cell in order to favour virus replication, including ways to avoid detection by the immune system.

In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species (P. pygmaeus and P.kuhlii). These results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossetto, Federica; Iglesias-Caballero, Maria; Liedtke, H.

In recent years, an integrated model has emerged, where the CDC remains the basic management unit for TB control, while a general hospital is designated to provide clinical care for TB patients. This study aims to explore the factors that influence the integration of TB services in general hospitals and generate knowledge to aid the scale-up of integration of TB services in China. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach using interviews from sites in East and West China. Analysis was conducted using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: The more prosperous site in East China was more coordinated and thus had a better method of resource allocation and more patient-orientated service, compared with the poorer site in the West. The development of public health organizations appeared to influence how effectively integration occurred. An understanding from staff that hospitals had better capacity to treat TB patients than CDCs was a strong rationale for integration. However, the economic and political interests might act as a barrier to effective integration. Both sites shared the same challenges of attracting and retaining a skilled workforce for the TB services. The role of the health bureau was more directive in the Western site, while a more participatory and collaborative approach was adopted in the Eastern site. CONCLUSION: The process of integration identifies similarities and differences between sites in more affluent East China and poorer West China. Integration of TB services in the hospitals needs to address the challenges of stakeholder motivations and resource allocation. Effective inter-organizational collaboration could help to improve the efficiency and quality of TB service. Key words: TB control, service delivery, integration, hospitals, China.","publish_time":"2012-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Guanyang; Wei, Xiaolin; Walley, John D; Yin, Jia; Sun, Qiang","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31f33e2c73a467477e3a4a72e6ee128703946fe5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3349562.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22276746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centre for Disease Control","CDC"],"locations":["China","East","West China","West","East China"],"keyphrases":["integration of TB services","TB control","TB patients","quality of TB service","effective integration","suspected TB cases","process of integration","poorer West China","majority of China","affluent East China","general hospitals","sites","poorer site","public health care","health facilities","health bureau","Western site","prosperous site","Eastern site","service delivery","Disease Control","clinical care","development of public health organizations","qualitative approach","collaborative approach","study","better method of resource allocation","patient-orientated service","thematic framework approach","better capacity","challenges of stakeholder motivations","Effective inter-organizational collaboration","differences","CDCs","interviews","county level","Centre","basic management unit","strong rationale","Key words","staff","barrier","directive","similarities","efficiency","knowledge","integrated model","skilled workforce","political interests","recent years","understanding","scale","factors","Analysis","METHODS","RESULTS","role","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, tick borne encephalitis virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described.

In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63. All the positive samples were detected during December to March (2011 - 2012). CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR is a rapid and relatively inexpensive method for detection of respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sultani, Mozhdeh; Mokhtari Azad, Talat; Eshragian, Mohammadreza; Shadab, Azadeh; Naseri, Maryam; Eilami, Owrang; Yavarian, Jila","journal":"Jundishapur J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0f63b592a07e5823715e548da6f3605faf2bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4601230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468358/; https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.19041v2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of respiratory viruses","panel of respiratory RNA viruses","multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR","set of multiplex methods","SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays","direct detection of viruses","parainfluenza viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","bacterial causes of respiratory infections","multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction","severe acute respiratory syndrome","influenza-negative respiratory specimens","simultaneous detection","RNA extraction","development of molecular methods","age groups of hospitalized patients","clinical samples","coronaviruses NL63","year study","positive samples","coronavirus NL63","human metapneumovirus","rhinovirus","inexpensive method","enterovirus","SARS","Application","CONCLUSIONS","clinicians","cases of community","physician","RESULTS","OC43","OBJECTIVES","cDNA","MATERIALS","PIV1","overuse of antibiotics","BACKGROUND","PIV3","PIV4"],"language":"en"},

Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. METHODS: We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. FINDINGS: 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3\u00B73:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]). INTERPRETATION: Disease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.

The 135 participating herds were randomly selected from those in The Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System that had at least 15 cow-years. Each herd was followed for 1 yr. Fecal samples from calves with (n=68) or without (n=691) diarrhea were analyzed for the presence of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Eimeria species. Diarrheic samples (n=191) were assayed for rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli F5 by antigen ELISA. Blood samples (n=1,348) were analyzed for antibodies against BCoV and rotavirus. Potential risk factors for diarrhea were analyzed by using Cox regression analysis adjusted for herd frailty effect. Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium were the most commonly detected enteropathogens in diarrheic samples. A high level of Cryptosporidium shedding or BCoV seropositive calves in a herd was associated with an increased risk of diarrhea. Other factors found to increase the risk of diarrhea were use of slatted concrete floor in group pens versus other floor types [hazard ratio (HR)=8.9], housing of calves in free-stalls compared with tie-stalls (HR=3.7), purchasing of calves into the herd versus not purchasing calves (HR=4.1), and calves being born during winter compared with other seasons of the year (HR=1.5).","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gulliksen, S.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petropoulos, Fotios; Makridakis, Spyros","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa9f61d7fe13c22c7b5ad4dc6f5324412ee6b0b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108716.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed COVID","confirmed cases of COVID","spread of confirmed cases","objective forecasts","accurate forecasting","disease","future","paper","live forecasting exercise","ample historical data","objective approach","past pattern","massive potential implications","planning","decision","continuing increase","significant role","vested interests","novel coronavirus","timeline","reliability","analysis","sizable associated uncertainty","global impact","number of deaths","psychological factors","people","prediction","danger","question","continuation","powerful method","recoveries","variables","fear","risks","way","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

By the end of nineteenth century, these beliefs were displaced by more modern concepts of disease, namely, the formulation of the \u201Cgerm theory,\u201D which asserted that bacteria or other microorganisms caused disease. With the emergence of chronic degenerative and of autoimmune diseases in the last century, the causative role of microorganisms has been intensely debated; however, no clear explanatory models have been achieved. In this review, we examine the current available literature regarding the relationships between infections and 16 autoimmune diseases. We critically analyzed clinical, serological, and molecular associations, and reviewed experimental models of induction of and, alternatively, protection from autoimmune diseases by infection. After reviewing several studies and reports, a clinical and experimental pattern emerges: Chronic and multiple infections with viruses, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, may, in susceptible individuals, play a role in the evolvement of autoimmune diseases. As the vast majority of infections pertain to our resident microbiota and endogenous retroviruses and healthy carriage of infections is the rule, we propose to focus on understanding the mechanisms of this healthy carrier state and what changes its configurations to infectious syndromes, to the restoration of health, or to the sustaining of illness into a chronic state and/or autoimmune disease. It seems that in the development of this healthy carriage state, the infection or colonization in early stages of ontogenesis with key microorganisms, also called \u2018old friends\u2019 (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria among others), are important for the healthy living and for the protection from infectious and autoimmune syndromes.","publish_time":"2008-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pordeus, V.; Szyper-Kravitz, M.; Levy, R.

Methods Trainees of the Taiwan Association of Nurse Anesthetists from northern Taiwan and junior residents from our department were enrolled into the training program. A 4-hour renewal curriculum in the management of airway emergen-cies was developed, which consisted of a 2-hour general lecture (including 4 divided sections) and a 2-hour instructor-based real-time multimedia medical simulation of 4 specific techniques. After detailed explanation of each specific instrument at the beginning of each simulation, the instructors demonstrated accurate and successful management of 4 airway crises from clinical experience by using a standardized human patient simulator situated on the stage of the conference room. Meanwhile, real-time display of instructors\u2019 performance, responsive physical parameters and images from specific instruments were conducted by video camera and video processor, and projected on a 3-frame screen. Brief summary and feedback were performed after each simulation. Trainees completed a questionnaire 6 months after they participated in the training program. Results Two hundred and forty-two nurse anesthetists and 13 young residents were trained with this protocol. The questionnaire revealed that the renewal training program was useful.

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015\u20132016 were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.","publish_time":"2018-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qi; Wang, Leyi; Zheng, Ying; Zhang, Jianqiang; Guo, Baoqing; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Gauger, Phillip C.; Harmon, Karen M.; Main, Rodger G.; Li, Ganwu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5970503.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801460/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1001-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["North America","Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["PEDV-positive pigs","PEDV infection","PEDV infected diarrheic pigs","virome of PEDV infected pigs","different RNA genera","RNA virome","different families","different viruses","PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples","diarrheic piglets","entire microbiome of different body sites","extensive RNA viral flora","generation sequencing","global swine industry","advancements of sequencing technology","Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis","re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","severe economic loss","Europe","Asia","effect","North America","Alphacoronavirus genus","hypothesis-free metagenomics approach","Picornaviridae","presence","findings","disease severity","Caliciviridae","Astroviridae","study","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","host","US states","METHODS","objective","Coronaviridae","Mamastrovirus","CONCLUSION","Enterovirus","Sapelovirus","Posavirus","Kobuvirus","Sapovirus","Teschovirus","Pasivirus","Deltacoronavirus"],"language":"en"},

While efforts continue in studying the large scale dissemination of contagious diseases, individual-based activity and behaviour study benefits not only disease transmission modelling but also the control, containment, and prevention decision making at the local scale. The potential for using tracking technologies to capture detailed space-time trajectories and model individual behaviour is increasing rapidly, as technological advances enable the manufacture of small, lightweight, highly sensitive, and affordable receivers and the routine use of location-aware devices has become widespread (e.g., smart cellular phones). The use of low-cost tracking devices in medical research has also been proved effective by more and more studies. This study describes the use of tracking devices to collect data of space-time trajectories and the spatiotemporal processing of such data to facilitate micro-scale flu transmission study. We also reports preliminary findings on activity patterns related to chances of influenza infection in a pilot study. METHODS: Specifically, this study employed A-GPS tracking devices to collect data on a university campus. Spatiotemporal processing was conducted for data cleaning and segmentation. Processed data was validated with traditional activity diaries. The A-GPS data set was then used for visual explorations including density surface visualization and connection analysis to examine space-time activity patterns in relation to chances of influenza infection. RESULTS: When compared to diary data, the segmented tracking data demonstrated to be an effective alternative and showed greater accuracies in time as well as the details of routes taken by participants. A comparison of space-time activity patterns between participants who caught seasonal influenza and those who did not revealed interesting patterns. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that tracking technology an effective technique for obtaining data for micro-scale influenza transmission research. The findings revealed micro-scale transmission hotspots on a university campus and provided insights for local control and prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Feng; Du, Fei","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b293146d54c66eef361bc16cc69f793f46f88f1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3579692.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-12-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23388060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A-GPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["segmented tracking data","data of space-time trajectories","diary data","data cleaning","Processed data","use of tracking devices","GPS data set","GPS tracking devices","micro-scale flu transmission study","micro-scale influenza transmission research","comparison of space-time activity patterns","local scale","use of low-cost tracking devices","pilot study","tracking technologies","micro-scale transmission hotspots","behaviour study benefits","individual-based activity","chances of influenza infection","aware devices","seasonal influenza","interesting patterns","detailed space-time trajectories","traditional activity diaries","large scale dissemination of contagious diseases","disease transmission modelling","increasing threats","increasing population density","local control","university campus","effective technique","participants","spatiotemporal processing","model individual behaviour","routine use of location","Infectious diseases","medical research","prevention decision","prevention strategies","preliminary findings","density surface visualization","public health","connection analysis","visual explorations","insights","relation","affordable receivers","manufacture of small","greater accuracies","containment","BACKGROUND","technology","technological advances","smart cellular phones","sophisticated social networks","details of routes","efforts","potential","segmentation","RESULTS","studies","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We assessed this technique on 482 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms, previously analyzed with commercial multiplex assay for 16 major respiratory viruses.

We examined temporal trends in the use of lung biopsy after HCT. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent their first allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between the years 1993 to 1997, 2003 to 2007, and 2013 to 2015 and subsequently underwent surgical lung biopsy for any reason. Lung biopsy between cohorts were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with death and relapse considered competing risks. Of 1418 patients, 52 (3.7%) underwent 54 post-HCT surgical lung biopsies during 1993 to 1997 compared with 24 (2.1%) and 25 biopsies in the 2003 to 2007 cohort; 2 cases of surgical lung biopsies out of 786 HCT recipients occurred during the 2013 to 2015 cohort (.25%). The median time to biopsy post-HCT was 71.5 days (IQR, 31 to 89) for the early cohort and 97 days (IQR, 42 to 124) for the late cohort, for an overall biopsy incidence of .15 and .075 per 1000 patient days in the first year after HCT, respectively. Patients in the 2003 to 2007 cohort were less likely to undergo a lung biopsy (adjusted HR, .50; 95% CI, .29 to .83; P = .008) when compared with patients in the early cohort, but more patients in the early cohort underwent lung biopsy without antecedent bronchoscopy (25/54 [46%] versus 3/25 [12%], P = .005). Although infections were a more common finding at biopsy in the early cohort (35/1418 versus 8/1148, P \u003C .001), the number of biopsies demonstrating noninfectious lesions was similar between the two cohorts (19/1418 versus 17/1148, P = .76). Fungal infections were the major infectious etiology in both cohorts (32/35 [91%] versus 5/8 [63%], P = .07), but there was a significant reduction in the number of Aspergillus species found at biopsy between the cohorts (30/54 versus 1/25, P \u003C .001). A similar percentage underwent biopsy with therapeutic intent for invasive fungal disease in the 2 cohorts (8/54 [15%] versus 4/25 [16%]). Surgical evaluation of lung disease in HCT recipients significantly declined over a span of 2 decades. The decline from the years 1993 to 1997 compared with 2003 to 2007 was because of a reduction in the number of biopsies for post-transplant infections due to aspergillosis, which is temporally related to improved diagnostic testing by minimally invasive means and the increased use of empiric therapy with extended-spectrum azoles. This practice of primary nonsurgical diagnostic and treatment approaches to pulmonary disease post-HCT have continued, shown by low numbers of surgical biopsies over the last 3 years.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Guang-Shing; Stednick, Zach J.; Madtes, David K.; Boeckh, Michael; McDonald, George B.; Pergam, Steven A.","journal":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a8cc16472e824ab8c4fab89c720d202cc7e722b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590103/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2016.08.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879116303196; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879116303196","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surgical lung biopsy","biopsy post-HCT","use of lung biopsy","post-HCT surgical lung biopsies","early cohort","HCT recipients","cases of surgical lung biopsies","pulmonary disease post-HCT","allogeneic HCT","cohorts","Surgical evaluation of lung disease","number of biopsies","late cohort","overall biopsy incidence","low numbers of surgical biopsies","post-transplant infections","Fungal infections","years","reviewed patients","invasive fungal disease","diagnosis of enigmatic pulmonary disease","respiratory infections","pulmonary abnormalities","patient days","IQR","number of Aspergillus species","invasive means","increased use of empiric therapy","similar percentage","significant reduction","improved diagnostic testing","practice of primary nonsurgical diagnostic","treatment approaches","death","hematopoietic cell transplantation","therapeutic intent","Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","relapse","Cox proportional hazards model","recent advancements","major infectious etiology","extended-spectrum azoles","noninfectious lesions","common finding","antecedent bronchoscopy","clinicians","median time","competing risks","temporal trends","adjusted HR","span","aspergillosis","reason","decades","decline"],"language":"en"},

The current study aimed to investigate whether IFN-\u03BBs are involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. METHODS: TaqMan allele discrimination assays were used to determine IFNL3/4 SNP genotypes of 1620 healthy controls and 1013 SLE patients (two independent cohorts consisting of 831 and 182 subjects, respectively) from Taiwan. The distributions of IFNL3/4 SNP genotypes and allele frequencies were compared between SLE patients and healthy controls and among SLE patients stratified by clinical phenotypes. ELISA was used to determine the serum IFN-\u03BB3 concentrations of SLE patients. RESULTS: All major IFN3/4 SNP alleles were significantly associated with the risk for lupus nephritis (rs8099917T, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24\u20132.47; rs12979860C, P(FDR) = 0.0034, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.18\u20132.30; rs4803217C, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.25\u20132.48; and ss469415590TT, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23\u20132.42) among SLE patients. Similarly, the major IFNL3/4 SNP haplotype rs8099917T-ss469415590TT-rs12979860C-rs4803217C (or T-TT-C-C) was a significant risk factor for lupus nephritis (P = 0.0015, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22\u20132.32). Additionally, all minor IFN3/4 SNP alleles were significantly associated with SLE susceptibility in nephritis-negative SLE patients as compared to normal healthy controls (rs8099917G, P(FDR) = 0.00177, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.24\u20132.28; rs12979860T, P(FDR) = 0.00299, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18\u20132.32; rs4803217A, P(FDR) = 0.00176, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22\u20132.23; and ss469415590\u0394G, P(FDR) = 0.00176, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26\u20132.29). Furthermore, the elevated serum levels of IFN-\u03BB3 were significantly correlated with the complement depression and the high SLE disease activities in SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-\u03BB3/4 genetic variants play a unique role in the development of lupus nephritis and SLE.

In contrast to IFNs, IL-4 did not show antiviral activity when administered immediately after SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that IL-4 acts early during the SARS-CoV replication cycle. Indeed, binding of recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein to Vero E6 cells was diminished on cells treated with IL-4, but also on cells exposed to IFN-\u03B3. Consistent with these observations, IL-4 and IFN-\u03B3 downregulated cell surface expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor. Besides diminished ACE2 cell surface expression, ACE2 mRNA levels were also decreased after treatment with these cytokines.

Viral pseudotypes have proven to be powerful tools to study the effects of viral evolution on serological outcomes, viral tropism and immunogenicity studies. Pseudotyped viruses are chimeric constructs in which the outer (surface) glycoprotein(s) of one virus is combined with the replication-defective viral \u201Ccore\u201D of another virus. Pseudotypes allow for accurate, sequence-directed, sensitive antibody neutralisation assays and antiviral screening to be conducted within a low biosecurity facility and offer a safe and efficient alternative to wildtype virus use. The protocol outlined here represents a rapid and reliable method for the generation of high-titre pseudotype viral particles with the MERS-CoV spike protein on a lentiviral core, and is adapted from previously published protocols. This protocol is optimised for transfection in a 100 mm Petri dish with 7 ml of supernatant harvested, however it can be readily scaled to different production volumes. This protocol has a number of advantages including: \u2022 Use of readily available reagents. \u2022 Consistent, high virus titres. \u2022 Rapid generation of novel glycoproteins for research into strain variation.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grehan, K.; Ferrara, F.; Temperton, N.","journal":"MethodsX","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4bd5a0ba03a2e9a26d6a39e5386d01ef7a18a65.json; document_parses/pdf_json/892fc12b9b9b6cf0030efee835b76a5c7879f0c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4625112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587388/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215016115000461; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2015.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016115000461","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral pseudotypes","viral tropism","pseudotyped viral particles","effects of viral evolution","replication-defective viral","wildtype virus use","titre pseudotype viral particles","high virus titres","generation of high","Pseudotyped viruses","Rapid generation of novel glycoproteins","lentiviral core","different production volumes","serological outcomes","MERS-CoV spike protein","sensitive antibody neutralisation assays","research","antiviral screening","efficient alternative","sequence","fields of serology","chimeric constructs","immunogenicity studies","surface","strain variation","reliable method","powerful tools","low biosecurity facility","Petri dish","vaccine development","applications","transfection","number of advantages","available reagents","published protocols"],"language":"en"},

Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemics\u2014and the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamics\u2014modellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (\u201Cdelay distributions\u201D) were known. METHODS: We estimated delay distributions in the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2006 and 2010. To do so, we used encrypted health insurance numbers to link 1.34 billion health care billing records to 4.27 million hospital inpatient stays. Because the four year period we studied included three typical influenza seasons and the 2009 influenza pandemic, we were able to compare the delay distributions in non-pandemic and pandemic settings. We also estimated conditional probabilities such as the probability of hospitalization within the year if diagnosed with influenza. RESULTS: In non-pandemic [pandemic] years, delay distribution medians (inter-quartile ranges) were: Service to Admission 6.3 days (0.1\u201317.6 days) [2.4 days (-0.3\u201313.6 days)], Admission to Discharge 3 days (1.4\u20135.9 days) [2.6 days (1.2\u20135.1 days)], Admission to Death 5.3 days (2.1\u201311 days) [6 days (2.6\u201313.1 days)]. (Service date is defined as the date, within the year, of the first health care billing that included a diagnostic code for influenza-like-illness.) Among individuals diagnosed with either pneumonia or influenza in a given year, 19% [16%] were hospitalized within the year and 3% [2%] died in hospital. Among all individuals who were hospitalized, 10% [12%] were diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the year and 5% [5%] died in hospital. CONCLUSION: Our empirical delay distributions and conditional probabilities should help facilitate more accurate forecasts in the future, including improved predictions of hospital bed demands during influenza outbreaks, and the expected effects of hospitalizations on epidemic dynamics.

The objective was to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak on the use of emergency resources. METHODS: An ecologic analysis of emergency department (ED) records between September and December 2015, was performed. Data was obtained from the National Emergency Department Information System database for Korea. All demographic and diagnostic data from patients presenting with febrile symptoms as a main complaint were collected. The data were compared to the equivalent period in the three years preceding the MERS outbreak in Korea. RESULTS: Following the MERS outbreak, there was an increase in overall ED visits by febrile patients and the proportion of visits by febrile patients, relative to total ED attendances. This effect was more prominent in the children under five years. The duration of the chief complaint before ED arrival and the length of ED stay were significantly increased among younger pediatric patients. Decreased body temperature on arrival was observed in younger pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: MERS outbreak appears to have had a significant effects on ED use by febrile patients. The use of emergency care services by pediatric patients makes them more vulnerable to an outbreak of a transmissable disease. An effective strategy to control emergency center visits by non-urgent febrile patients and provide proper medical services is urgently needed.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeong, Hyunho; Jeong, Sikyoung; Oh, Juseok; Woo, Seon Hee; So, Byung Hak; Wee, Jeong Hee; Kim, Ji Hoon; Im, Ji Yong; Choi, Seung Pill; Park, Kyoungnam; Cho, Byul Nim Hee; Hong, Sungyoup","journal":"Clin Exp Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/786282089d03a2eaed7139f503755faa30dd741f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5511955.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717779/; https://doi.org/10.15441/ceem.16.166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["National Emergency Department Information System","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["geriatric patients","younger pediatric patients","ED use","MERS outbreak","non-urgent febrile patients","ED arrival","overall ED visits","febrile symptoms","emergency center visits","use of emergency resources","use of emergency care services","length of ED stay","total ED attendances","health of pediatric","ecologic analysis of emergency department","proportion of visits","significant effects","Korea","years","diagnostic data","OBJECTIVE","National Emergency Department Information System database","chief complaint","main complaint","proper medical services","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Outbreaks of transmissible respiratory infection","increase","impact","effective strategy","Decreased body temperature","children","METHODS","equivalent period","duration","records","transmissable disease","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs for HBV, such as lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains during prolonged antiviral therapy. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has been reported to possess potent activity against various viruses. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro activity of CH against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates in transiently transfected cells. HBV DNA was extracted from serum samples collected both before lamivudine therapy and at the time of viral breakthrough and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons were cloned into a novel expression vector, pHY106, which can initiate the intracellular HBV replication cycle after cell transfection. Following transfection of the cloned amplicon into HepG2 cells, a drug susceptibility assay was performed. The level of viral antigen, HBeAg, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was used for determining the amount of intracellular HBV DNA. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV replication, was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to explore the possible antiviral mechanism of CH. The results showed that CH inhibited replication and HBeAg production by either wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates in a dose-dependent manner. The Hsc70 mRNA was also downregulated significantly. In conclusion, CH is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates, and its activity may be associated with its inhibition of host Hsc70.","publish_time":"2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yu-Bing; Wang, Ya-Feng; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Li-Yun; Yang, Xiao-Ang; Wang, Ning; Jiang, Jin-Hua; Ma, Fang; Yin, De-Tao; Sun, Chang-Yu; Wang, Qing-Duan","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/392d6a3aa7466a54c4261b5f43011edbc813b8ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094493.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22387093/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299912001665; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299912001665","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates","lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates","intracellular HBV DNA","intracellular HBV replication cycle","lamivudine therapy","activity of CH","clinical wild-type","Q-PCR","RT-PCR","resistant viral strains","CH inhibited replication","reverse transcription PCR","Quantitative real-time PCR","clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs","prolonged antiviral therapy","potent activity","inhibition of host Hsc70","Hsc70 mRNA","drug susceptibility assay","time of viral breakthrough","possible antiviral mechanism of","level of viral antigen","HepG2 cells","emergence of drug","HBeAg production","transfected cells","cell transfection","host protein","cloned amplicon","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","infection","results","major public health problems","Abstract Hepatitis B virus","serum samples","dose-dependent manner","pHY106","ELISA","polymerase chain reaction","natural alkaloid-derived compound","novel expression vector","Heat stress cognate","various viruses","Cepharanthine hydrochloride","amplicons","conclusion","present study"],"language":"en"},

Wet markets are critical for food security and sustainable development in their respective regions. Due to their cultural significance, they attract numerous visitors and consequently generate tourist-geared information on the Web (ie, on social networks such as TripAdvisor). These data can be used to create a novel, international wet market inventory to support epidemiological surveillance and control in such settings, which are often associated with negative health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using social network data, we aimed to assess the level of wet markets\u2019 touristic importance on the Web, produce the first distribution map of wet markets of touristic interest, and identify common diseases facing visitors in these settings. METHODS: A Google search was performed on 31 food market\u2013related keywords, with the first 150 results for each keyword evaluated based on their relevance to tourism. Of all these queries, wet market had the highest number of tourism-related Google Search results; among these, TripAdvisor was the most frequently-occurring travel information aggregator, prompting its selection as the data source for this study. A Web scraping tool (ParseHub) was used to extract wet market names, locations, and reviews from TripAdvisor. The latter were searched for disease-related content, which enabled assignment of GeoSentinel diagnosis codes to each. This syndromic categorization was overlaid onto a mapping of wet market locations. Regional prevalence of the most commonly occurring symptom group - food poisoning - was then determined (ie, by dividing the number of wet markets per continent with more than or equal to 1 review containing this syndrome by the total number of wet markets on that continent with syndromic information). RESULTS: Of the 1090 hits on TripAdvisor for wet market, 36.06% (393/1090) conformed to the query\u2019s definition; wet markets were heterogeneously distributed: Asia concentrated 62.6% (246/393) of them, Europe 19.3% (76/393), North America 7.9% (31/393), Oceania 5.1% (20/393), Africa 3.1% (12/393), and South America 2.0% (8/393). Syndromic information was available for 14.5% (57/393) of wet markets. The most frequently occurring syndrome among visitors to these wet markets was food poisoning, accounting for 54% (51/95) of diagnoses. Cases of this syndrome were identified in 56% (22/39) of wet markets with syndromic information in Asia, 71% (5/7) in Europe, and 71% (5/7) in North America. All wet markets in South America and Oceania reported food poisoning cases, but the number of reviews with syndromic information was very limited in these regions (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: The map produced illustrates the potential role of touristically relevant social network data to support global epidemiological surveillance. This includes the possibility to approximate the global distribution of wet markets and to identify diseases (ie, food poisoning) that are most prevalent in such settings.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kogan, Nicole E; Bolon, Isabelle; Ray, Nicolas; Alcoba, Gabriel; Fernandez-Marquez, Jose L; M\u00FCller, Martin M; Mohanty, Sharada P; Ruiz de Casta\u00F1eda, Rafael","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6462893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932867/; https://doi.org/10.2196/11477","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Europe","North America","South America","Oceania"],"keyphrases":["total number of wet markets","global distribution of wet markets","wet market names","distribution map of wet markets of touristic","mapping of wet market locations","international wet market inventory","food market","syndromic information","level of wet markets\u2019 touristic importance","food poisoning cases","TripAdvisor","food security","number of reviews","symptom group - food poisoning","syndromic categorization","syndrome","South America","settings","North America","tourist-geared information","travel information aggregator","related Google Search results","data source","highest number of tourism","global epidemiological surveillance","social networks","continent","numerous visitors","related keywords","Oceania","Asia","Europe","potential role of touristically relevant social network data","Web scraping tool","disease-related content","common diseases","respective regions","sustainable development","selection","control","ParseHub","novel","assignment of GeoSentinel diagnosis codes","hits","fresh meat","accounting","cultural significance","OBJECTIVE","queries","query\u2019s definition","BACKGROUND","negative health outcomes","relevance","study","METHODS","possibility","Regional prevalence","CONCLUSIONS","Africa","diagnoses"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare self-perceived proficiency of PPE use and objective performance, and identify predictors of low compliance and PPE misuse. Methods An observational study combined with subjective questionnaires were carried out during a bioterror simulation drill. Forty-two observers evaluated performance under PPE. Mistakes were recorded and graded using a structured observational format and were correlated with the subjective questionnaires and with demographic parameters. Results One hundred seventy-eight HCWs from community clinics and hospitals were included. The mean self-perceived proficiency was high (6.1 out of 7), mean level of comfort was moderate (4.0 out of 7), and mean objective performance was intermediate (9.5 out of 13). There was no correlation between comfort and objective performance scores. Self-perceived proficiency was in correlation with donning and continuous performance with PPE but not with doffing. Clinic personnel performed better than personnel in hospitals (40.3% vs 67.8% with 3 or more mistakes, respectively; P = .001). Demographic characteristics had no correlation with objective or self-perceived performance. Conclusions Self-perceived proficiency is a poor predictor of appropriate PPE use.

One area where such activity-based probes have been applied is the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, which is emerging as an important therapeutic target. A family of reagents has been developed that specifically label deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) and facilitate characterization of their inhibitors. Scope of review: Here we focus on the application of probes for intracellular DUBs, a group of specific proteases involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system. In particular, the functional characterization of the active subunits of this family of proteases that specifically recognize ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins will be discussed. In addition we present the potential and design of activity-based probes targeting kinases and phosphatases to study phosphorylation. Major conclusions: Synthetic molecular probes have increased our understanding of the functional role of DUBs in living cells. In addition to the detection of enzymatic activities of known members, activity-based probes have contributed to a number of functional assignments of previously uncharacterized enzymes. This method enables cellular validation of the specificity of small molecule DUB inhibitors. General significance: Molecular probes combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and cellular assays represent a powerful approach for discovery and functional validation, a concept that can be expanded to other enzyme classes. This addresses a need for more informative cell-based assays that are required to accelerate the drug development process.

Interestingly, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based vectors transduced immortalized pig cells as well as pig primary cells more efficiently than HIV-1\u2013based vectors. PAE express TRIM5\u03B1, a well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor. We contrasted the restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5\u03B1 against FIV- and HIV-based vectors using gain and loss of function approaches. We observed no effect on HIV-1 or FIV conferred transgene expression in response to porcine TRIM5\u03B1 overexpression or knockdown. To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine airways in vivo, we delivered vector expressing mCherry to the tracheal lobe of the lung and the ethmoid sinus of 4-week-old pigs. One week later, epithelial cells expressing mCherry were readily detected. Our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human HAE and provide further support for the selection of GP64 as an appropriate envelope pseudotype for future preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model of cystic fibrosis (CF).","publish_time":"2012-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sinn, Patrick L; Cooney, Ashley L; Oakland, Mayumi; Dylla, Douglas E; Wallen, Tanner J; Pezzulo, Alejandro A; Chang, Eugene H; McCray, Paul B","journal":"Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f86a27f248abc89aef420f88323538086c8b9f8f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9ad169296fd3ed0191dfe8434f8836ec88f6b628.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3511674.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mtna.2012.47; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253116301123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187455/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253116301123","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAE","FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine epithelia","pseudotyped FIV vectors","HIV-based vectors","porcine TRIM5\u03B1 overexpression","porcine airways","pig primary cells","restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5\u03B1","immortalized pig cells","human airway epithelia","well-differentiated primary cultures of pig airway epithelia","porcine model of cystic fibrosis","PAE express TRIM5\u03B1","epithelial cells","human HAE","mCherry","gene transfer efficiencies similar","lentiviral vector development","transduction efficiencies","similar tropisms","selection of GP64","ability of GP64","week-old pigs","well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor","wild-type pigs","future preclinical gene therapy studies","appropriate envelope pseudotype","response","gain","transgene expression","ethmoid sinus","tracheal lobe","lung","loss of function approaches","CF","support","knockdown","feline immunodeficiency virus","study","findings","effect"],"language":"en"},

A shuffling MARS algorithm is utilized to select the most important variables in QSAR modeling and then these variables were used as inputs of ANFIS to predict SARS inhibitory activities of pyridine N-oxide derivatives. A data set of 119 drug-like compounds was coded with over hundred calculated meaningful molecular descriptors. The best descriptors describing the inhibition mechanism were solvation connectivity index, length to breadth ratio, relative negative charge, harmonic oscillator of aromatic index, average molecular weight and total path count. These parameters are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The statistical parameters of R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.884 and 0.359, respectively. The accuracy and robustness of shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS model in predicting inhibition behavior of pyridine N-oxide derivatives (pIC50) was illustrated using leave-one-out and leave-multiple-out cross-validation techniques and also by Y-randomization.

DNA vaccination should meet these requirements. This review describes studies in this field performed exclusively on birds (chickens, ducks and turkeys). No evaluations of avian DNA vaccine efficacy performed on mice as preliminary tests have been taken into consideration. The review first describes the state of the art for DNA vaccination in poultry: pathogens targeted, plasmids used and different routes of vaccine administration. Second, it presents strategies designed to improve DNA vaccine efficacy: influence of the route of administration, plasmid dose and age of birds on their first inoculation; increasing plasmid uptake by host cells; addition of immunomodulators; optimization of plasmid backbones and codon usage; association of vaccine antigens and finally, heterologous prime-boost regimens.

Secondly, the appearance of AIDS, at the beginning of the 1980s, prompted the creation of specific units dedicated to the care of problems associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the concomitant opportunistic infections arising from the immunodeficiency arising from the HIV infection. Thirdly, in the last decades and even today, nosocomial infections have appeared as an alarming problem, needing the presence of specialist physicians in this field. Finally, emigration and international travel require specialists in infectious diseases with specific expertise in international health, once more highlighting the importance of the specialty of Infectious Diseases.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mar\u00EDa Aguado Garc\u00EDa, Jos\u00E9; Loyarte, Jos\u00E9 Antonio Iribarren; Mateos, Jes\u00FAs G\u00F3mez; Rodero, F\u00E9lix Guti\u00E9rrez; Porta, Ferr\u00E1n Segura","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf6801825e8f933349753bd8c52ec5f40165b14c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X08765959; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X08765959","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Espa\u00F1a","Spain"],"keyphrases":["at the beginning of the","highlighting the importance of the specialty of Infectious Diseases","the appearance of AIDS","brief summary of the clinical history of the diagnosis and treatment of infectious","in the last decades and","the origins of a specialty arising from the need for specialists","the care of problems associated with","needing the presence of specialist physicians in","infection and the concomitant opportunistic infections arising from the immunodeficiency arising from the HIV infection","prompted the creation of specific units dedicated","the different health problems of patients affected by infectious","in Spain","enfermedades infecciosas","emigration and international travel require specialists in infectious","with specific expertise in international health","primer lugar","practical and modern form","immunodeficiency virus","infecci\u00F3n nosocomial","campo","problemas planteados","forma alarmante","forma pr\u00E1ctica","problemas asociados","This paper","disciplina de infectolog\u00EDa","presencia de infect\u00F3logos expertos","nosocomial infections have appeared as an alarming problem","today","attend","formaci\u00F3n especial","tratamiento","control","salud internacional","plena actualidad","especialistas","Finally","field","Thirdly","creaci\u00F3n de unidades espec\u00EDficas dedicadas","or\u00EDgenes","soluci\u00F3n","pacientes","Secondly","Firstly","inmunodeficiencia humana","enorme florecimiento","presente manuscrito","breve resumen","especialidad fruto","infecciones oportunistas concomitantes","necesidad","importancia","aparici\u00F3n","comienzo","secciones referidas","described","viajes","historia","Espa\u00F1a","emigraci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) fullfils many requirements of an animal model of FHF. This work investigated changes in MAPK, NF-\u03BAB, AP-1 and STAT pathways during RHD-induced liver injury. Rabbits were infected with 2 \u00D7 10(4) hemagglutination units of an RHD virus isolate. Apoptosis was documented by the presence of caspase-3 activity and substantial PARP proteolysis at 36 and 48 h postinfection (pi). Infection induced a marked and maintained expression of TNF-\u03B1 from 12 h pi, while there was only a transitory increase in IL-6 expression. Expression of phosphorylated (p)-JNK, p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 was significantly elevated at 12 h pi. At 48 h pi p-JNK expression was maintained at a maximum level, while that of p-p38 returned to normality and there was no p-ERK1/2 expression. Activation of NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 and increased expression of VCAM-1 and COX-2 were observed. No significant changes were detected in activation of STAT1 and STAT3, while SOCS3 expression increased significantly. The current findings suggest that activation of JNK is an essential component in liver injury mediated by the RHD virus and that lack of activation of STAT3, probably mediated by SOCS3 over-expression, would contribute to the inhibition of the regenerative response. Data show the presence of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage and the lack of regeneration and they support the usefulness of this model to investigate novel therapeutical modalities in FHF.","publish_time":"2009-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Lastra, Rodrigo; San-Miguel, Beatriz; Crespo, Irene; Jorquera, Francisco; Alvarez, Marcelino; Gonz\u00E1lez-Gallego, Javier; Tu\u00F1\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa J.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0de060f5c461ead49985ae12548a278065215c32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2756571.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1051/vetres/2009050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19726019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FHF","STAT","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h pi p-JNK expression","SOCS3 expression","Expression of phosphorylated","p-p38","p-ERK1","maintained expression of TNF","SOCS3 over-expression","increased expression of VCAM","activation of JNK","RHD virus","Activation of NF","lack of activation","RHD-induced liver injury","activation of STAT1","h postinfection","animal model of FHF","liver damage","NF-\u03BAB","STAT3","presence of caspase","lack of regeneration","significant changes","experimental animal models","presence of molecular mechanisms","fullfils","requirements","STAT pathways","activity","MAPK","essential component","substantial PARP proteolysis","challenging problem","Rabbit hemorrhagic disease","novel therapeutical modalities","clinical conditions","Management of fulminant hepatic failure","maximum level","usefulness","Data","work","inhibition","transitory increase","hemagglutination units","current findings","normality","regenerative response","COX","Apoptosis","Rabbits"],"language":"en"},

This demand has accelerated following increasing terrorism fears. Ironically these same concerns have lead to tightening of both import and export controls preventing many laboratories, particularly those outside of the United States, from gaining access to positive control material. This in turn has prevented many laboratories from introducing much needed molecular diagnostic tests. We describe here a generic approach for preparing synthetic DNA or RNA control material for use in either TaqMan or conventional PCR assays. The production of synthetic controls using this approach does not require cloning or special equipment or facilities beyond that found in any laboratory performing molecular diagnostics. The approach significantly reduces the possibility of contamination or erroneously reporting false-positive reactions due to contamination from positive control material. Synthetic controls produced using this approach have been employed in all molecular diagnostic tests performed in our laboratory and are used irrespective of whether we possess the organism or not.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Greg; Smith, Ina; Harrower, Bruce; Warrilow, David; Bletchly, Cheryl","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f49e76027cbc70800e90e07cd272d52ac403602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112797.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093406001054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093406001054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Medical"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["positive control material","needed molecular diagnostic tests","veterinary diagnostic","generic approach","molecular diagnostics","RNA control material","production of synthetic controls","synthetic DNA","laboratory","export controls","false-positive reactions","public health laboratories world-wide","possibility of contamination","use","TaqMan","access","facilities","cloning","conventional PCR assays","special equipment","exotic diseases","demand","increasing terrorism fears","United States","turn","concerns","organism"],"language":"en"},

The separation was performed by a Eurospher-100 C(8) reversed-phase column (250 \u00D7 4.6 mm i.d., 5 \u03BCm) and the mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile:water:glacial acetic acid (30:30:40:1 v/v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(\u22121). The extraction procedure has been screened by a two level full factorial design for determination of statistically significant parameters. Thereafter, the identified parameters, extraction temperature, time and solvent volume were optimized by a Box\u2013Behnken design. The proposed mathematical model was based on analysis of variance results and correctly explained the behavior of the response in the experimental domain. R (2) value adjusted for numbers of degrees of freedom was 0.9915 and P-value for lack of fit, 0.8499 at the 95% confidence level, P \u003E 0.05. The optimal condition identified were extraction temperature, 70 \u00B0C, time, 13.8 min and solvent volume 2.0 mL. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed MAE method, results were compared with those obtained with the liquid extraction method. Extraction efficiency and precision were higher when MAE has been used.

Materials and methods: The systematic review was conducted under the PRISMA guidelines (registration number is: CRD42019134173). The PubMed database was searched between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2019 under the following search strategy: (((antagomiR) OR (mirna antagonists) OR (mirna antagonist)) AND ((lung[MeSH Terms]) OR (\u201Clung diseases\u201D[MeSH Terms]))).

However, its biological effects in the kidney are still not clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of licorice in rats with gentamicin (GM)-induced acute tubular necrosis. Design and Methods Rats were randomized into the control group (only saline for 12 days), licorice group (licorice for 12 days), GM group (GM for 12 days), GM \u002B licorice group, and licorice-treated GM group (licorice for 12 days after taking GM for 12 days). Blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels were measured and histopathological analyses of the kidneys were performed. The oxidative side of oxidant-antioxidant balance was evaluated by detecting lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total peroxide levels, and antioxidative side was determined by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in plasma and kidney tissues. Results The oxidant-antioxidant balance seemed to be shifted to the oxidative side in the GM group when compared with the control and GM \u002B licorice groups. In GM group, biochemical profiles showed a remarkable increase in blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine levels, and depletion of renal tissue and plasma TAC and GSH levels. In addition, histopathologic studies revealed severe acute tubular necrosis, congestion, and hyaline casts, verifying GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Licorice was effective in reduction of blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels, and also effective in decreasing the tubular necrosis score. Licorice treatment also significantly reduced LPO and total peroxide levels, and increased TAC and GSH levels in both renal tissue and blood. Moreover, these changes in rats subjected to the combined therapy (GM \u002B licorice) were significantly less than those of GM group. Conclusions Licorice ameliorates GM-induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative damage by scavenging oxygen free radicals, decreasing LPO, and improving antioxidant defense.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aksoy, Nurten; Dogan, Yunus; Iriadam, Mehmet; Bitiren, Muharrem; Uzer, Elmas; Ozgonul, Abdullah; Aksoy, Sahin","journal":"Journal of Renal Nutrition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcb276ccadd4e4f994ba8861bdf9d680ff5c8496.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111674.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051227611001191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22047711/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1051227611001191; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jrn.2011.07.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GM","LPO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["licorice-treated GM group","Licorice treatment","Conclusions Licorice","efficiency of licorice","licorice groups","GM-induced nephrotoxicity","GSH levels","creatinine levels","days","control group","uric acid levels","total peroxide levels","blood uric acid","total antioxidant capacity","antioxidant defense","oxidant-antioxidant balance","reduction of blood urea","plasma TAC","reduced LPO","tubular necrosis score","severe acute tubular necrosis","increased TAC","oxidative damage","therapeutic effects","antibacterial effects","biological effects","Methods Rats","depletion of renal tissue","reduced glutathione","kidney tissues","remarkable increase","histopathologic studies","congestion","hyaline casts","biochemical profiles","oxygen free radicals","anti-inflammatory","lipid peroxidation","gentamicin","histopathological analyses","Objectives Various protective","combined therapy","addition","antioxidative","kidneys","Design","changes"],"language":"en"},

They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Simiao; Zhang, Zongjiu; Yang, Juntao; Wang, Jian; Zhai, Xiaohui; B\u00E4rnighausen, Till; Wang, Chen","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b52f104c4eefbe2ad2509d5a0ebf6e6a0894d3f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620307443; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620307443; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fangcang"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Summary Fangcang shelter hospitals","development of Fangcang shelter hospitals","temporary hospitals","China","moderate COVID","health-care facilities","public health emergencies","basic medical care","novel public health concept","disease monitoring","outbreak","existing public venues","rapid referral","frequent monitoring","rapid construction","essential functions","essential living","social engagement","social activities","coronavirus disease","triage","food","massive scale","stadiums","isolation","powerful components of national responses","low cost","key characteristics","future epidemics","exhibition centres","isolate patients","pandemic","families","communities","time"],"language":"en"},

Effective surveillance strategies are required in countries with a high influx of migrants from the Middle East to mitigate the probable importation of MERS-CoV. We discuss here the risk of MERS-CoV in major labor sending countries and list the probable strategies for control and prevention of MERS-CoV using Sri Lanka as an example. It is conservatively estimated that 10% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population work as international labor migrants (1.8 to 2 million workers), with 93% residing in the Middle East. An average of 720 workers depart each day, with the majority of these workers (71%) departing to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the country with 81.5% of total MERS-CoV cases). We also describe other inbound migration categories such as tourists and resident visa holders relevant to the context of preparedness and planning. The importance of partnerships between public health authorities at national and regional levels with labor migration networks to establish institutional and/or policy mechanisms are highlighted for ensuring effective preparedness and response planning.

This crisis, an epidemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), dramatically impacted the delivery of health care in Canada. Despite the passage of time since the last diagnosed case of SARS in April 2004, researchers have warned the global community to be prepared for future outbreaks of SARS or other infectious diseases. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 participants representing key stakeholder groups: (a) pediatric patients with probable or suspected SARS, (b) their parents, and (c) health care professionals providing direct care to SARS patients. Results Participants conveyed key areas in which health policy and practice were affected. These included the development of communication strategies for responding to SARS; easing vulnerability among all stakeholders; and the rapid development of practice guidelines. Conclusion Given the continuing threat of current and future airborne viruses with potential for epidemic spread and devastating outcomes, preparedness strategies are certainly needed. Effective strategies in pediatrics include practices that provide family centered care while minimizing disease transmission. Toward this end, lessons learned from previous outbreaks merit consideration and may inform future epidemics.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholas, David B.; Gearing, Robin E.; Koller, Donna; Salter, Robyn; Selkirk, Enid K.","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99835e16efe9a1ca8d4b4769773f608217a8495d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132509.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851007002758; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851007002758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.11.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","future outbreaks of SARS","suspected SARS","health care professionals","delivery of health care","direct care","diagnosed case of SARS","patient care considerations","family centered care","research study addresses health policy","outlines policy","future epidemics","pediatric patients","preparedness strategies","practice implications","crisis","Effective strategies","development of communication strategies","rapid development of practice guidelines","future airborne viruses","epidemic spread","key areas","Results Participants","pediatric setting","key stakeholder groups","previous outbreaks merit consideration","epidemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","potential","continuing threat of current","devastating outcomes","practices","Abstract Objectives","lessons","pediatrics","disease transmission","stakeholders","parents","global community","infectious diseases","Conclusion","end","researchers","Canada","Methods Qualitative interviews","passage of time","vulnerability"],"language":"en"},

Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over- and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Punjani, Ali; Zhang, Haowei; Fleet, David J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffcfdf9b1ba722f4bfff8c71c65c93b0b64981a0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/93f67ffe7803061de9b19c4dfa346b3aa97aa4eb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.15.877092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D images","non-uniform refinement","D map quality","D density map quality","D density maps","D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins","common iterative refinement methods","existing iterative refinement algorithms","small membrane proteins","disordered regions","particle images","Single particle cryo-EM","local regions","uniform filtering operations","improved resolution","structural biology","results","varying structural properties","notable structural studies","state-of-the-art resolution","disordered structures","common examples","spatial variability","spatial uniformity","important use case","regularization","noise","molecular weight","flexibility","rigidity","account","signal useful","powerful method","lipid nanodiscs","higher resolutions","cross-validation approach","contrast","Detergent micelles","partial occupancy","kDa","drug discovery","cryoSPARC software package","traits","biological macromolecules"],"language":"en"},

Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.","publish_time":"2014-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Temmam, Sarah; Davoust, Bernard; Berenger, Jean-Michel; Raoult, Didier; Desnues, Christelle","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a87c83a672852a6d046357d68715f3c3c0cdf5b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4100157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918293/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms150610377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human viral infections","domestic animals","surveillance of zoonotic","zoonotic viruses","human transmissions","complete viral diversity","emerging zoonotic infections","arthropods","feces of infected animals","current knowledge of viral diversity","recent development of viral metagenomics","viromes of selected animals","new human host","humans","contact","arboviral diseases","important challenge","public health officials","wildlife","environment","bite","organism","characterization","possible future application","high-throughput sequencing technologies","particular blood","coming decades","urine","exposure","origin","bloodsucking arthropod","H1N1 flu pandemic","review","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We searched the English and Chinese literature in PubMed, CNKI and Google Scholar databases with the keywords including \u201Cprivate hospitals in China\u201D, \u201Chospital ownership\u201D, \u201Cpublic and private hospital\u201D, \u201Cprivate hospital development\u201D. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to assess the trend of the private hospital development in China and worldwide. Both the change of private hospitals in supply capacity and health care delivery were studied in this paper. The number of hospitals, number of hospital beds and the average number of hospital beds per hospital were employed to measure the supply capacity. The visit number, inpatients number, and bed occupancy rate (BOR) were used to measure the healthcare delivery. The data was collected from the China Health Statistical Yearbook and the \u201COrganisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) Statistics\u201D website. Results: The private sector rapidly expanded in China\u2019s hospital market in recent years. The number of private hospitals exceeded the public in 2015. There has also been a significant rise for the indicators of both the supply capacity (including number of hospitals, number of hospital beds and the average number of hospital beds per hospital) and the health care delivery (inpatients number and BOR) of the private hospitals. However, the growth rates of them were relatively lower than the public. The expansion trend of China\u2019s private sector in the hospital market accorded with most the OECD countries around the world. In 2016, China was above the medium level of the share of the private hospitals\u2019 number with the OECD countries, but below the medium for the supply capacity, in terms of the hospital beds. Conclusion: As a result of the economic growth and supporting policy, the private sector has experienced a vast expansion in China\u2019s hospital market in the past decade. The rising gap in average size between private and publicly owned hospitals, and the inconsistent development between the private hospitals\u2019 supply capacity and their market share, have become the two main challenges. Meanwhile, the future policy in supporting the private sector should be carefully introduced to advance the whole healthcare delivery system development in China.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Chenhui; Li, Xiaosong; Pan, Jay","journal":"Global Health Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b89a727fdeb1c662c990b0193f2d00104dbb3ffa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2414644719301381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2414644719301381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar","OECD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["private hospital development","number of private hospitals","private hospitals\u2019 number","number of hospitals","average number of hospital beds","hospital ownership","change of private hospitals","China\u2019s hospital market","private hospitals\u2019 supply capacity","inpatients number","visit number","expansion trend of China\u2019s private sector","owned hospitals","inconsistent development","healthcare delivery system development","market share","health care delivery","China Health Statistical Yearbook","public","OECD countries","average size","BOR","economic growth","vast expansion","medium level","future policy","growth rates","Descriptive statistical analysis","PubMed","CNKI","Organisation","keywords","Google Scholar databases","bed occupancy rate","Co-operation","Chinese literature","English","Statistics","indicators","rising gap","recent years","past decade","terms","website","Abstract Objective","significant rise","world","paper","Results","main challenges","global perspective","Conclusion","Methods"],"language":"en"},

This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as \u22651 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in \u22651 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08\u20132.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35\u20134.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was \u22642 weeks for all viruses and detections of \u22653 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.","publish_time":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byington, Carrie L.; Ampofo, Krow; Stockmann, Chris; Adler, Frederick R.; Herbener, Amy; Miller, Trent; Sheng, Xiaoming; Blaschke, Anne J.; Crisp, Robert; Pavia, Andrew T.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17835eecde9308297878b9fa44c765f96504a37d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4583580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26245665/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ486; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/61/8/1217/16787458/civ486.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioFire Diagnostics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms","additional weeks of virus detection","duration of virus detection","person-weeks","viral detection episodes","consecutive weeks","mean duration of PCR detection","longer durations of PCR detection","Children younger","Younger children","young children","rhinovirus detections","Viral illnesses","individuals","bocavirus","single person households","viral etiology of respiratory illness","respiratory viruses","interpretation of positive PCR tests","nasal swab data","nasal swabs","concurrent symptom","older participants","weekly symptom diaries","platform","influenza","FilmArray polymerase chain reaction","families","BioFire Diagnostics","human metapneumovirus","odds ratio","age","clinical settings","Coronaviruses","LLC","family composition","years","confidence interval","Background","study","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, background depletion and virome enrichment techniques are usually needed for clinical samples where viral load is much lower than background sequences. Methods A viral Sequence Independent Targeted Amplification (VSITA) approach using a set of non-ribosomal and virus-enriched octamers (V8) was developed and compared with traditionally used random hexamers (N6). Forty-five archived clinical samples of different types were used in parallel to compare the V8 and N6 enrichment performance of viral sequences and removal performance of ribosomal sequences in the step of reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ten sera samples from patients with fever of unknown origin and 10 feces samples from patients with diarrhea of unknown origin were used in comparison of V8 and N6 enrichment performance following NGS analysis. Results A minimum 30 hexamers matching to viral reference sequences (sense and antisense) were selected from a dataset of random 4,096 (46) hexamers (N6). Two random nucleotides were added to the 5\u0027 end of the selected hexamers, and 480 (30 \u00D7 42) octamers (V8) were obtained. In general, VSITA approach showed higher enrichment of virus-targeted cDNA and enhanced ability to remove unwanted ribosomal sequences in the majorities of 45 predefined clinical samples. Moreover, VSITA combined with NGS enabled to detect not only more viruses but also achieve more viral reads hit and higher viral genome coverage in 20 clinical samples with diarrhea or fever of unknown origin. Conclusion The VSITA approach designed in this study is demonstrated to possess higher sensitivity and broader genome coverage than traditionally used random hexamers in the NGS-based identification of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"ZHANG, Yi; ZHANG, Chen; LI, Bo; LI, Yang; Zhou, HE Xiao; LI, Acher; WU, Wei; DUAN, Su Xia; QIU, Fang Zhou; WANG, Ji; SHEN, Xin Xin; YANG, Meng Jie; LI, De Xin; MA, Xue Jun","journal":"Biomedical and Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0962a0e082cd1537cc485a4ea9c85e86f623fa97.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398818300539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29773090/; https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2018.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398818300539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N6 enrichment performance of viral sequences","viral reference sequences","random hexamers","predefined clinical samples","viral reads","viral load","background sequences","feces samples","sera samples","higher viral genome coverage","environmental sequences","VSITA approach","selected hexamers","unwanted ribosomal sequences","removal performance of ribosomal sequences","higher enrichment of virus","archived clinical samples of different types","NGS-based identification of viral pathogens","fever of unknown origin","diarrhea of unknown origin","NGS analysis","comparison of V8","viral Sequence Independent Targeted Amplification","dataset of random","random nucleotides","higher sensitivity","virome enrichment techniques","patients","broader genome coverage","set of non-ribosomal","virus-enriched octamers","targeted cDNA","background depletion","enhanced ability","generation sequencing","step of reverse transcription","majorities","Methods","interference","Abstract Objective Unbiased","quantitative PCR","host","sense","study","qPCR","viruses","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A seroepidemiological investigation was conducted among MERS-CoV case patients (cases) and their household contacts to investigate transmission risk in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Cases diagnosed between 1 January 2013 and 9 May 2014 and their household contacts were approached for enrollment. Demographic, clinical, and exposure history data were collected. Sera were screened by MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, with results confirmed by microneutralization assay. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 34 (91%) case patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and did not require oxygen during hospitalization. MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in 13 of 24 (54%) case patients with available sera, including 1 severely symptomatic, 9 mildly symptomatic, and 3 asymptomatic case patients. No serologic evidence of MERS-CoV transmission was found among 105 household contacts with available sera.

Improved means of antemortem diagnosis is required to facilitate clinical decision making. Information regarding the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of neurologic FIP currently is limited, resulting in the need for better descriptions to optimize its use as a diagnostic tool. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic features and MRI findings in cases of confirmed neurologic FIP. ANIMALS: Twenty\u2010four client\u2010owned cats with histopathologic confirmation of neurologic FIP. METHODS: Archived records from 5 institutions were retrospectively reviewed to identify cases with confirmed neurologic FIP that had undergone antemortem MRI of the CNS. Signalment, clinicopathologic, MRI, and histopathologic findings were evaluated. RESULTS: Three distinct clinical syndromes were identified: T3\u2010L3 myelopathy (3), central vestibular syndrome (7), and multifocal CNS disease (14). Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities were detected in all cases, including meningeal contrast enhancement (22), ependymal contrast enhancement (20), ventriculomegaly (20), syringomyelia (17), and foramen magnum herniation (14). Cerebrospinal fluid was analysed in 11 cases; all demonstrated a marked increase in total protein concentration and total nucleated cell count. All 24 cats were euthanized with a median survival time of 14 days (range, 2\u2013115) from onset of clinical signs. Histopathologic analysis identified perivascular pyogranulomatous infiltrates, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, or both affecting the leptomeninges (16), choroid plexuses (16), and periventricular parenchyma (13). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Magnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive means of detecting neurologic FIP, particularly in combination with a compatible signalment, clinical presentation, and CSF analysis.","publish_time":"2017-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crawford, A.H.; Stoll, A.L.; Sanchez\u2010Masian, D.; Shea, A.; Michaels, J.; Fraser, A.R.; Beltran, E.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a16d3975bbb4ad4f44786d1e5961d16d21f863.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5598904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28833469/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","CNS","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["findings of neurologic FIP","confirmed neurologic FIP","cases","histopathologic confirmation of neurologic FIP","MRI findings","histopathologic findings","antemortem MRI","clinical presentation","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities","Histopathologic analysis","distinct clinical syndromes","clinical decision making","onset of clinical signs","multifocal CNS disease","ependymal contrast enhancement","meningeal contrast enhancement","lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates","owned cats","sensitive means","clinicopathologic features","Improved means of antemortem diagnosis","CSF analysis","compatible signalment","common infectious central nervous system","total protein concentration","perivascular pyogranulomatous infiltrates","Feline infectious peritonitis","central vestibular syndrome","total nucleated cell count","marked increase","T3","client","combination","median survival time","days","L3 myelopathy","institutions","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","better descriptions","METHODS","Archived records","range","leptomeninges","ANIMALS","RESULTS","Information","choroid plexuses","foramen magnum herniation","diagnostic tool","need","OBJECTIVE","Cerebrospinal fluid","periventricular parenchyma","syringomyelia"],"language":"en"},

Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies\u0027 calibration affects the arrival times\u0027 agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.","publish_time":"2014-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tizzoni, Michele; Bajardi, Paolo; Decuyper, Adeline; Kon Kam King, Guillaume; Schneider, Christian M.; Blondel, Vincent; Smoreda, Zbigniew; Gonz\u00E1lez, Marta C.; Colizza, Vittoria","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e023845ba693ca1f8667d37d40b02626a6c2ecd5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/48d2fb4c7f2e29d8c9fe1f673190513d78fad4b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4091706.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010676/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7272v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mobile phone data","mobile phone commuting network","commuting flows","census data","epidemic model","corresponding commuting networks","empirical commuting patterns","proxy mobility data","approximating commuting patterns","mobility sources","Human mobility","distributions of commuting fluxes","different mobility layers","mobile phones","different models","individual mobility","data incompleteness","epidemic situation","epidemic control","illness epidemic","systematic overestimation of commuting traffic","census sources","resulting epidemic invasion patterns","different resolution scales","terms of epidemic observables","radiation model","Metapopulation models","official census surveys","traffic discrepancies","higher accuracy","desired accuracy","European countries","affected locations","peripheral locations","total fluxes","key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases","link","arrival times\u0027 agreement","order of infection","seed","Proxies\u0027 calibration","opposite","high degree","influenza","light","diffusion","study","opportunity","accounting","records","epidemics","unavailability","Results"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We report one pediatric case of COVID-19. A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a symptom of fever, and was diagnosed with a mild form of COVID-19. The child\u2019s mother and grandmother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, the lymphocyte counts were normal. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment. The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild. Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.

This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Li-juan; Xu, Jian; Xu, Zhi-hao; Xia, Xiao-ping; Li, Bin; He, Jian-guo; Zhao, Peng; Pan, Jian-wei; Zhang, Dan; Su, Yue; Wang, Yue-hong; Yuan, Zhe-feng","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ad5728b21055dd19defb86fabe916a6fb2275c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05056-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["present pediatric case of COVID","SARS-CoV","clinical characteristics of COVID","RNA of SARS","mild form of COVID","potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID","disappearance of symptoms","stool","nasopharyngeal swabs","cases","CASE PRESENTATION","children","lymphocyte counts","clinical recovery","Coronavirus Disease","novel coronavirus infection","scattered ground glass opacities","right lower lobe close","pleura","extended period of time","ages","days","hospital","resorption","chest computed tomography","grandmother","people","child\u2019s mother","household transmission","CONCLUSION","month-old boy","symptom of fever","BACKGROUND","treatment","differences","adults","patient","attention"],"language":"en"},

The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP.","publish_time":"2015-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, In Young; Jeon, Yong Duk; Ahn, Mi-young; Goag, Eunkyong; Lee, EunHye; Ahn, Hea Won; Ahn, Jin Young; Ku, Nam Su; Kim, June Myung; Choi, Jun Yong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/638c6b2e4772152a6cba52184c98dec9ca288c16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4512086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26201392/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1025-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bronchiolitis"],"organizations":["BOOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative tuberculosis PCR results","occurrence of BOOP","mild BOOP","diagnosis of BOOP","anti-tuberculosis medication","Miliary tuberculosis","day treatment","respiratory virus PCR","HIV-infected patients","potential treatment option","CD4 T-cell count","Rapid chest x-ray improvement","CASE PRESENTATION","cells","clarithromycin monotherapy","rapid radiologic improvement","normal chest x-ray","diffuse lung infiltration","day history of fever","clinical case reports","ART improved","respiratory bronchioles","poor adherence","intravenous ceftriaxone","time of admission","type of diffuse interstitial lung disease","human immunodeficiency virus","anti-retroviral therapy","year history of cough","Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction","scan","assay","stain","lumens","Aspergillus galactomannan antigen","AFB","Bacterial culture","sputum production","tiny centrilobular nodules","Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia","video","tree","high resolution computed tomography","acid-fast bacilli","macrolides","pathology of fibroblastic plugs","alveolar ducts","VATS","BACKGROUND","cause","bud pattern","surgical biopsy","thoracoscopic surgery","alveoli","regular outpatient follow-up","discharge","Korea","year-old female","consideration","Pathologic findings","gastrointestinal troubles","lungs","unknown etiology","cases","months","CONCLUSION","years prior"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, arenaviruses pose a biodefense threat. No licensed anti-arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with anemia and other side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective vaccines and better antiviral drugs to combat the dual threats of naturally occurring and intentionally introduced arenavirus infections. The development of arenavirus reverse genetic systems is allowing investigators to conduct a detailed molecular characterization of the viral cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that control each of the steps of the arenavirus life cycle, including RNA synthesis, packaging and budding. Knowledge derived from these studies is uncovering potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as facilitating the establishment of assays to identify and characterize candidate antiviral drugs capable of interfering with specific steps of the virus life cycle. Likewise, the ability to generate predetermined specific mutations within the arenavirus genome and analyze their phenotypic expression would significantly contribute to the elucidation of arenavirus-host interactions, including the basis of their ability to cause severe HF.

For hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, apoptosis and other forms of cell-death have been observed in vitro and in vivo but the detailed understanding of this intricate viral-host interplay is unclear. This study examined the role played by the HCV p7 protein in the induction of cell-death. By measuring caspase-3/7 activation and cleavage of endogenous PARP, two hallmarks of apoptosis, the overexpression of p7 protein was shown to induce apoptosis in Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, p7-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Similar to the M2 protein of influenza A virus, p7-induced apoptosis is independent of its ion channel activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments further showed that both M2 and p7 interact with the essential autophagy protein Beclin-1. However, only the M2 protein could cause an increase in the level of LC3-II, which is an indicator of autophagic activity. Thus, although the p7 protein is functionally similar to the well-characterized M2 protein, they differ in their activation of autophagic cell-death. Taken together, these results shed more light on the relationship between the HCV p7 ion channel protein and cell-death induction in host cells.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aweya, Jude Juventus; Mak, Tze Minn; Lim, Seng Gee; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d319d99c47121e61e0a0b91a600b29020aafbd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114515.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212004674; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23246447/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212004674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV p7 protein","overexpression of p7 protein","p7-induced apoptosis","HCV p7 ion channel protein","M2 protein of influenza","cell-death induction","induction of cell","well-characterized M2 protein","activation of autophagic cell-death","hallmarks of apoptosis","forms of cell","essential autophagy protein Beclin","host cells","ion channel activity","indicator of autophagic activity","intricate viral-host interplay","caspase-dependent","hepatitis C virus","infection","relationship","cleavage of endogenous PARP","increase","role","detailed understanding","light","proteins","extrinsic pathways","level of LC3","results","Coimmunoprecipitation experiments","viruses","Huh7","study"],"language":"en"},

The chromatographic resolution between the various adenovirus proteins was optimized by studying the effect of the TFA concentration and the column temperature, applying a full factorial design of experiments. A reproducible baseline separation of all relevant adenovirus proteins could be achieved within 17 min run time. Samples containing adenovirus particles could be directly injected into the UPLC system without sample pretreatment. The viruses reproducibly dissociate into proteins in the UPLC system upon contact with the mobile phase containing ACN. The new RP-UPLC method was successfully validated for protein profiling and relative quantification of proteins in vaccine products based on adenovirus vector types 26 and 35. The intermediate precision of the relative peak areas of all proteins was between 1% and 14% RSD, except for the peak assigned to protein V (26% RSD).

The hallmark of T(regs) is the expression of the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor. Natural regulatory T cells (nT(regs)) are a distinct population of T cells that express CD4 and FoxP3. nTregs develop in the thymus and function in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance. Other CD4(\u002B), CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD8(\u002B)CD28(-) T cells can be induced to acquire regulatory function by antigenic stimulation, depending on the cytokine milieu. Inducible (or adaptive) T(regs) frequently express high levels of the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25). Atypical T(regs) express FoxP3 and CD4 but have no surface expression of CD25. Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) produce IL-10, while T helper 3 cells (Th3) produce TGF-\u03B2. The function of inducible T(regs) is presumably to maintain immune homeostasis, especially in the context of chronic inflammation or infection. Induction of T(regs) in coronaviral infections protects against the more severe forms of the disease attributable to the host response. However, arteriviruses have exploited these T cell subsets as a means to dampen the immune response allowing for viral persistence. T(reg) induction or activation in the pathogenesis of disease has been described in both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, and mouse hepatitis virus. This review discusses the development and biology of regulatory T cells in the context of arteriviral and coronaviral infection.","publish_time":"2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cecere, Thomas E.; Todd, S.

The molecular cause of the unusually high human pathogenicity of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is still unknown. In an effort to characterize molecular components of the virus that are absent in other coronaviruses, all of which are considerably less pathogenic for humans, we recombinantly produced the SARS-unique domain (SUD) within non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) of SARS-CoV and characterized its nucleic-acid binding properties.

However, it has recently been suggested that they may cause more severe respiratory disease. Immunofluorescence (IF) assays are rapid and inexpensive and are often used for the detection of respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop an IF procedure, using commercially available reagents, for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses directly from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). STUDY DESIGN: From 1st November 2006 until 31st October 2007 all NPA from patients with respiratory infection were stained with the Light Diagnostic Pan-Enterovirus Reagent \u2013 \u201CBlend\u201D by IF (IF-ENVPAN). Those specimens which tested positive with this stain were further tested (subject to the availability of frozen specimen) with the xTAG respiratory viral panel, a multiplex PCR directed against respiratory picornaviruses, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory sincytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IFA and IFB), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronaviruses. RESULTS: 241/1122 NPA tested positive by IF-ENVPAN. 143 NPA were available for testing by xTAG respiratory viral panel. The multiplex PCR detected respiratory picornaviruses in 139 NPA, in 126 as the sole viral pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential of IF-ENVPAN for the laboratory detection of respiratory picornaviruses in clinical specimens. As far as we are aware, this is the first publication of such a method.","publish_time":"2009-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barbani, Maria Teresa; Gorgievski-Hrisoho, Meri","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4339f506a042a5a549b445d5bd60ceb68cd10c2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172351.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19502108/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002030; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Respiratory"],"organizations":["NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infection","detection of respiratory viruses","laboratory detection of respiratory picornaviruses","respiratory sincytial virus","NPA","xTAG respiratory viral panel","severe respiratory disease","causes of self-limited upper respiratory tract infection","ENVPAN","multiplex PCR","RESULTS","sole viral pathogen","parainfluenza virus","influenza viruses","available reagents","clinical specimens","IFA","ADV","adenovirus","testing","Light Diagnostic Pan-Enterovirus Reagent","IFB","RSV","availability of frozen specimen","nasopharyngeal aspirates","subject","PIV","enteroviruses","rhinoviruses","human metapneumovirus","assays","HMPV","coronaviruses","Blend","stain","potential","BACKGROUND","patients","publication","Immunofluorescence","CONCLUSIONS","procedure","STUDY DESIGN","method","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age\u003E16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working and age\u003E60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. CONCLUSION Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world. This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stedman, Mike; Lunt, Mark; Davies, Mark; Gibson, Martin; Heald, Adrian","journal":"International journal of clinical practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392377/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13533","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["relative impact of Covid","healthcare resources","case incidence regression","range of relative healthcare impact","healthcare utilisation","healthcare workload","strongest determinants of case incidence","Average case morbidity","median practice","practice population numbers","patient population","CONCLUSION Covid","GP practice granularity","local population comorbidity","individual GP practice impact scores","GP practices","national median","social care resources","included population density","relative local levels of disease burden","comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact","estimate of relative demand","limited care resources","local responses","novel coronavirus","SARS-CoV","model","Office of National Statistics","new strain of coronavirus","social deprivation","utilisation of health","patient engagement","parts of England","INTRODUCTION Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","IMD2019","Quality Outcome Framework","latitude","key factors","longitude","location","BME ethnicity","defined criteria","dynamic situation","useful information","QOF","indicators","fulltime work","latest values","METHODS","way","infection transmission rates","long-term condition management","education","world","outbreak","humans"],"language":"en"},

Methods A prospective hospital-based study was conducted over three consecutive winters (2006\u20132008) in children aged \u003C1\u201315 years presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). 168 children with ILI and their healthy families were recruited over three winter seasons. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 101 (60.8%) children with ILI; in 91/166 (54.8%) a single pathogen was detected, and in the remaining 10 children more than one virus was detected concurrently. Influenza was the most common virus detected (34/101), followed by rhinoviruses (22/101) and adenoviruses (14/101). Of influenza viruses, 21/34 were influenza A and 13/34 influenza B. Meeting the clinical definition of ILI did not differentiate between influenza and other viruses. Clinical ILI developed within one week of follow up in 12% (26/205) of the family members who were swabbed. Viral pathogens were detected in 42.3% (11/26) of the symptomatic family members. In 6/11 cases the same virus was detected in the adult and child. The lower estimate of the household risk of transmission of respiratory viruses, based on concordant proven infection in both child and adult, from a single sick child to adult household contacts is therefore 3% per week.

To assess the current state of mathematical models for the global spread of infectious diseases, we reviewed the literature highlighting common approaches and good practice, and identifying research gaps. We followed a scoping study method and extracted information from 78 records on: modelling approaches; input data (epidemiological, population, and travel) for model parameterization; model validation data. We found that most epidemiological data come from published journal articles, population data come from a wide range of sources, and travel data mainly come from statistics or surveys, or commercial datasets. The use of commercial datasets may benefit the modeller, however makes critical appraisal of their model by other researchers more difficult. We found a minority of records (26) validated their model. We posit that this may be a result of pandemics, or far-reaching epidemics, being relatively rare events compared with other modelled physical phenomena (e.g. climate change). The sparsity of such events, and changes in outbreak recording, may make identifying suitable validation data difficult. We appreciate the challenge of modelling emerging infections given the lack of data for both model parameterisation and validation, and inherent complexity of the approaches used. However, we believe that open access datasets should be used wherever possible to aid model reproducibility and transparency. Further, modellers should validate their models where possible, or explicitly state why validation was not possible.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walters, Caroline E.; Mesl\u00E9, Margaux M.I.; Hall, Ian M.","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ad36224231a9d13f9d9d91cec6f6ee3187e0f16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6227252.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2018.05.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436517301135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853411/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436517301135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model validation data","population data","travel data","epidemiological data","lack of data","input data","model parameterisation","model parameterization","model reproducibility","identifying suitable validation data difficult","modelling approaches","global spread of infectious diseases","common approaches","Abstract Mathematical models","current state of mathematical models","use of commercial datasets","open access datasets","rare events","minority of records","challenge of modelling emerging infections","good practice","literature","published journal articles","modelled physical phenomena","outbreak recording","far-reaching epidemics","information","wide range of sources","statistics","inherent complexity","climate change","changes","surveys","critical appraisal","scoping study method","result of pandemics","research gaps","risks","understanding","researchers","transparency","sparsity","modellers"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) response, which may significantly contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that ORF4b in the cytoplasm could specifically bind to TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03BAB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03B5), suppress the molecular interaction between mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and IKK\u03B5, and inhibit IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent IFN-\u03B2 production. Further analysis showed that ORF4b could also inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-\u03B2, whereas deletion of the nuclear localization signal of ORF4b abrogated its ability to inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-\u03B2, but not IFN-\u03B2 production induced by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK\u03B5, and TBK-1, suggesting that ORF4b could inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03B2 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Collectively, these results indicate that MERS-CoV ORF4b inhibits the induction of type I IFN through a direct interaction with IKK\u03B5/TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism. Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or thwart a host\u2019s antiviral responses. A novel human coronavirus (HCoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is distinguished from other coronaviruses by its high pathogenicity and mortality. However, virulence determinants that distinguish MERS-CoV from other HCoVs have yet to be identified. MERS-CoV ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral response, which may contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Here, we report the identification of the interferon (IFN) antagonism mechanism of MERS-CoV ORF4b. MERS-CoV ORF4b inhibits the production of type I IFN through a direct interaction with IKK\u03B5/TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism.

RNase L restricts viral infections by degrading viral and cellular RNA, inducing autophagy and apoptosis, and producing RNA degradation products that amplify production of type I interferons (IFNs) through RIG-I-like receptors. However, the effects of the OAS/RNase L pathway on IFN induction in different cell types that vary in basal levels of these proteins have not been previously reported. Here we report higher basal expression of both RNase L and OAS in mouse macrophages in comparison to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs, RNase L gene knockout decreased induction of IFN-\u03B2 by encephalomyocarditis virus infection or poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection. In contrast, in macrophages, RNase L deletion increased (rather than decreased) induction of IFN-\u03B2 by virus or pIC. RNA damage from RNase L in virus-infected macrophages is likely responsible for reducing IFN-\u03B2 production. Similarly, direct activation of RNase L by transfection with 2-5A induced IFN-\u03B2 in MEFs but not in macrophages. Also, viral infection or pIC transfection caused RNase L-dependent apoptosis of macrophages but not of MEFs. Our results suggest that cell-type-specific differences in basal levels of OAS and RNase L are determinants of IFN-\u03B2 induction that could affect tissue protection and survival during viral infections.","publish_time":"2014-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Shuvojit; Chakrabarti, Arindam; Jha, Babal Kant; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c6b13bdca7f70d6afec7257e4769bb5c10b1a19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3940032.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00856-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN induction","induction of IFN","IFN-\u03B2 production","\u03B2 induction","induced IFN-\u03B2","direct activation of RNase","determinants of IFN","MEFs","viral infections","OAS proteins","mouse macrophages","basal levels of OAS","virus-infected macrophages","pIC transfection","viral double-stranded RNA","dependent apoptosis of macrophages","cellular RNA","RNA damage","cell-type","encephalomyocarditis virus infection","production of type","poly","RNA degradation products","higher basal expression","different cell types","response","specific differences","comparison","tissue protection","pathway","gene knockout","autophagy","embryonic fibroblasts","interferons","IFNs","survival","rC","inducible antiviral state","RIG","ATP","results","synthetase","system","effects","contrast","deletion","receptors","oligoadenylate"],"language":"en"},

The situation has aroused concerns and discussions among medical professionals and educators for a new medical education program. Authorized by the Conference of Deans of Medical Schools in Taiwan, Prof. Chyi-Her Lin assembled a team for planning medical curricular reform. Subsequently, Prof. Shan-Chwen Chang organized a task force team which has been monitoring the new 6-year program since 2013. The aims of medical reform by Prof. Lin are (1) to eliminate the specialty training part, (2) to use innovative teaching methods to motivate students to learn proactively, and (3) to implement competency-based medical education.

RESULTS: We included 200 children with febrile seizures (mean age: 29.5 \u00B1 1.4.months; 104 male) in the study. In 2009, in 10 out of 49 (20 %) children, microbiology testing (bacterial/fungal) was positive compared with a rate of 74 out of 151 (49 %) children during 2010\u20132013 (p \u003C 0.01).

The synthetic WNV, produced by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA into cell culture, exhibited undistinguishable biological properties compared to the corresponding animal-derived wild-type virus. No differences were found concerning viral growth in mammalian and insect cell lines and concerning expression of viral proteins in cells. There were also no significant differences in virulence in mice following intranasal challenge. After immunizations of mice with experimental vaccines derived from the synthetic and wild-type viruses, protection from lethal challenge was achieved with similar amounts of antigen. Both vaccine preparations also induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice. In addition, the synthetic approach turned out to be very accurate, since the rescued WNV genome contained no undesired mutations. Thus, the first flavivirus based on chemical gene synthesis was indistinguishable from the parent virus. This demonstrates that virus isolates from animal sources are dispensable to derive seed viruses for vaccine production or research.","publish_time":"2010-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Orlinger, Klaus K.; Holzer, Georg W.; Schwaiger, Julia; Mayrhofer, Josef; Schmid, Karl; Kistner, Otfried; Noel Barrett, P.; Falkner, Falko G.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcf51e02cbcdd39542b6681e401b8f6cc1369435.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211218/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10002860; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.02.092; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10002860","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthetic WNV","parent virus","virus isolates","corresponding animal-derived wild-type virus","wild-type viruses","chemical synthesis","viral growth","rescued WNV genome","immunizations of mice","synthetic approach","complete genome of West Nile Virus","chemical gene synthesis","expression of viral proteins","preformed viral components","cell culture","seed viruses","animal sources","lethal challenge","intranasal challenge","vaccine preparations","vaccine production","significant differences","insect cell lines","undistinguishable biological properties","published sequence data","comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies","mammalian","virulence","transfection of","protection","transcribed RNA","experimental vaccines","research","undesired mutations","similar amounts of antigen","cDNA","cells","flavivirus","addition"],"language":"en"},

We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model; these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others.

Consumers can now access online bookings for airlines, accommodation, transportation, sightseeing tours and other related products, so why do they still go to travel agencies for reservations? This article identifies the attributes consumers seek in a travel agency or consultant and determines the relative importance of these in their selection process. The research was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a series of in-depth interviews with 10 travel agency users and three travel consultants. The second stage was a mail-out survey of 400 users of travel agencies in the Darling Downs area of Queensland, Australia. Despite its regionality, the region is a significant consumer of travel with approximately eight agencies in the city of Toowoomba alone. The in-depth interviews highlighted the need to de-emphasise two particular agency attributes, agency promotion and adequate brochure provision, from the research questions and replace these with parking and travel reward programs as factors worthy of investigation. Survey results revealed that there were 12 significant attributes impacting on consumer selection and, of these, the most important were the knowledge and experience of consultants, and the helpfulness and friendliness of consultants. Of particular note was that these attributes related to the consultant and not the agency per se. Travel reward programs were seen as the least influential in this research.","publish_time":"2006-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Eric; Cassidy, Frances; Brown, Les","journal":"Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83eaa2f75251e0ef105dd3922dc498012e4a7d0a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1447677000000061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1447677000000061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Toowoomba"],"keyphrases":["travel consultants","travel agency users","travel arrangements","users of travel agencies","travel reward programs","significant consumer of travel","particular agency attributes","attributes consumers","agency promotion","significant attributes","research questions","experience of consultants","friendliness of consultants","consumer selection","article","series of in-depth interviews","particular note","selection process","Survey results","related products","adequate brochure provision","accommodation","transportation","parking","Darling Downs area of Queensland","sightseeing tours","airlines","factors","need","online bookings","regional settings","Australia","relative importance","helpfulness","knowledge","investigation","mail","regionality","city of Toowoomba","stages","reservations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A rural-based cross sectional survey was carried out in Perak state in Peninsular Malaysia in March 2011. The survey recruited a population-representative sample using multistage sampling. Altogether 2379 participants were included in this study. Validated bowel/colorectal cancer awareness measure questionnaire was used to assess the level of colorectal cancer awareness among study population. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to identify socio-demographic variance of knowledge score on warning signs and risk factors of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Among respondents, 38% and 32% had zero knowledge score for warning signs and risk factors respectively. Mean knowledge score for warning signs and risk factors were 2.89 (SD 2.96) and 3.49 (SD 3.17) respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between the knowledge score of warning signs and level of confidence in detecting a warning sign. Socio-demographic characteristics and having cancer in family and friends play important role in level of awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Level of awareness on colorectal cancer warning signs and risk factors in the rural population of Malaysia is very low. Therefore, it warrants an extensive health education campaign on colorectal cancer awareness as it is one of the commonest cancer in Malaysia. Health education campaign is urgently needed because respondents would seek medical attention sooner if they are aware of this problem.","publish_time":"2013-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Tin Tin; Goh, Jun Yan; Tan, Jackson; Muhaimah, Abdul Rahim; Pigeneswaren, Yoganathan; Khairun, Nasirin Sallamun; Normazidah, Abdul Wahab; Tharisini, Devi Kunasekaran; Majid, Hazreen Abd","journal":"BMC Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e80e58924fd2feae8218fc7c2c066e75cec0149.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924238/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-13-376","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malaysia","Peninsular Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["colorectal cancer warning signs","level of colorectal cancer awareness","risk factors of colorectal cancer","level of awareness","knowledge score of warning signs","commonest cancer","colorectal cancer awareness measure questionnaire","rural population of Malaysia","Mean knowledge score","level of confidence","study population","socio-demographic variance of knowledge score","multi-ethnic rural population","Peninsular Malaysia","population-representative sample","respondents","SD","extensive health education campaign","Socio-demographic characteristics","Analysis of variance","cross sectional survey","family","important role","Validated bowel","friends","Perak state","significant positive correlation","multistage sampling","paper","medical attention","ANOVA","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","problem","RESULTS","participants"],"language":"en"},

Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females. In the present study, we analyzed 168 severe patients with COVID-19, including 86 males and 82 females, and 48 patients (28.6%) were diagnosed as critically ill. Of 86 male patients, 12.8% (11/86) died and 75.6% (65/86) were discharged; of 82 female patients, 7.3% (6/82) died and 86.6% (71/82) were discharged. Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities (OR = 3.824, 95% CI = 1.279\u201311.435). However, this association attenuated to null in female patients (OR = 2.992, 95% CI = 0.937\u20139.558). A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions. We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities. Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Yifan; Wu, Ping; Lu, Wanrong; Liu, Kui; Ma, Ke; Huang, Liang; Cai, Jiaojiao; Zhang, Hong; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiying; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7da72db559c616a430aa3e2d779528f0239e3993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7209966.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343745/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["female patients","consecutive severe patients","comorbidities","sex-specific differences","Clinical characteristics","treatment of COVID","laboratory parameters","similar sex-specific trend","clinical course","age","ill conditions","females","significant differences","higher risk","retrospective study","present study","adjusted logistic regression analysis","progression of Coronavirus Disease","prognosis","outcomes","pathogen","Tongji Hospital","Wuhan","China","important biological variable","potential mechanism","prevention","relationship","association"],"language":"en"},

Method: A review was undertaken of the English\u2010speaking literature on the potential for emerging viral threats to human health in Australia, the future implications of virus ecology, climate change and population movement and the implications for blood transfusion. Results: Published data confirm that Australia\u0027s blood supply is among the safest in the world for currently screened viral pathogens as a result of rigorous surveillance, donor selection and state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art processing and laboratory testing. However, Australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the Ross River, Barmah Forrest, Kunjin, Japanese Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis and dengue viruses. Of these, dengue is currently of most concern to blood safety because; it can cause fatalities, there are regular seasonal outbreaks in Northern Australia and, in contrast to other viruses mentioned above an overseas case of transfusion transmission has already been documented. Notably, despite the lack of a suitable dengue screening test the ARCBS already implements supplementary measures to protect the blood supply during outbreaks. Conclusion: Current interventions have proven extremely effective in minimising transfusion transmission in Australia of recognised viral pathogens. The threat posed by emerging viral pathogens to the safety of blood transfusion emphasises the need for global collaboration and consideration of further intervention strategies on a country by country basis including options such as nucleic acid testing and pathogen reduction technologies.","publish_time":"2008-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunstan, Robert A.; Seed, Clive R.; Keller, Anthony J.","journal":"Aust N Z J Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb461880fd6ad39e7afdf12639f3510fa26e80a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159787.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-6405.2008.00254.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18782399/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Murray Valley Encephalitis"],"locations":["Australia","Ross River"],"keyphrases":["blood safety","safety of blood transfusion","emerging viral pathogens","Australia\u0027s blood supply","Australian blood supply","Australia of recognised viral pathogens","screened viral pathogens","viral infections","emerging viral threats","Northern Australia","dengue viruses","minimising transfusion transmission","overseas case of transfusion transmission","potential","suitable dengue screening","Japanese Encephalitis","country basis","laboratory testing","Murray Valley Encephalitis","nucleic acid testing","regular seasonal outbreaks","future implications of virus ecology","Kunjin","donor selection","climate change","result of rigorous surveillance","population movement","human health","state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art processing","Barmah Forrest","intervention strategies","options","global collaboration","Ross River","need","consideration","pathogen reduction technologies","ARCBS","Published data","English\u2010speaking literature","supplementary measures","fatalities","risk","world","Current interventions","review","Results","lack","contrast","concern","number","Conclusion","Method","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

The label-free detection technology via direct attachment of a whole virus using a chemically modified electrode is a promising means to provide a simple and rapid diagnostic system for viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horiguchi, Yukichi; Goda, Tatsuro; Matsumoto, Akira; Takeuchi, Hiroaki; Yamaoka, Shoji; Miyahara, Yuji","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222368/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566317301100; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566317301100; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","avian influenza","H1N1 influenza","Neu5Ac\u03B1","prevention of influenza pandemics","direct detection","humans","viral hemagglutinin","viral infections","direct attachment","rapid diagnostic system","label-free detection technology","specific sialic acid","immobilized gold electrodes","sought-after tool","conventional immunochromatographic technique","SA","receptors","ICT","promising means","SL","biosensing surfaces","neuraminidase","modified electrode","key characteristics","Selective binding","Glc","genotype","segments","genetic drift","sensitivity","birds","Gal\u03B2","sialyllactose"],"language":"en"},

In previous studies we found that the application of ultraviolet light C (UV-C) in liquid plasma that was inoculated with a variety of bacteria or viruses of importance in the swine industry can be considered as redundant safety steps because in general achieve around 4 logs reduction for most of these pathogens. However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively. Group 2 pigs (0 J/L UV-C) got infection by PRRSV but no PCV-2 infection or seroconversion. However, one pig from group 2 seroconverted to Rotavirus A (RVA) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and three group 2 pigs seroconverted to Porcine parvovirus (PPV). Groups 1, 3 and 4 pigs showed no evidence of infection or seroconversion associated with the tested viruses or any other pathogens found in the liquid plasma before UV-C irradiation. Group 5 pigs developed PCV-2 infectivity as expected. UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma at 3000 and 9000 J/L was effective in preventing PRRSV and other pathogens transmission.

Its high mortality (roughly 38%) has raised public fear worldwide, calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutics to combat MERS-CoV infection. On the basis of our previous work in development of peptide fusion inhibitors against HIV and SARS-CoV, and the crystal structure of the six-helix-bundle core of the MERS-CoV spike protein, we identified a peptide derived from the MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit HR2 domain (HR2P) with a potent inhibitory activity against S-protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical properties, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo (appendix). Methods We assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of HR2P-M2 in vitro with pseudotyped MERS-CoVs in cell culture and in vivo with live MERS-CoVs in hDPP4-transgenic mice. The activities of HR2P-M2 to form six-helix bundles with HR1 peptides and to block fusion core formation between HR1 and HR2 peptides were studied using methods such as circular dichroism, N-PAGE, and FN-PAGE. Findings HR2P-M2 was highly effective in blockade of cell\u2013cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S proteins and inhibition of infection by MERS pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region, with IC50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition) less than 0\u00B77 \u03BCM. HR2P-M2 bound to the HR1 peptide to form stable six-helix bundles and blocked fusion core formation between the HR1 and HR2 peptides. Intranasal administration of HR2P-M2 before viral challenge fully protected hDPP4-transgenic mice (n=5) from MERS-CoV infection, whereas all the untreated mice (n=5) died 8 days after viral challenge. Interpretation Our findings suggest that the HR2P-M2 peptide merits further development as an effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV drug, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs, to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients and to prevent the disease in high-risk populations, including health-care workers and family members of patients.

The number of trials involving CAP patients is even higher, and the data suggest that corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death only in patients with severe disease. There are very few data concerning AOM, and there is currently no reason for prescribing corticosteroids to treat it. Overall, the data showed that there is, currently, no indication for the universal use of systemic corticosteroids in any of the reviewed diseases and, further, high-quality studies of all of these respiratory tract infections are needed in order to identify the patients for whom the prescription of corticosteroids is rationally acceptable.","publish_time":"2012-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Principi, N.; Bianchini, S.; Baggi, E.; Esposito, S.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb6488d06b85ede0249a22d9ef7cb85efe224d7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22993127/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-012-1747-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prescription of corticosteroids","prescribing corticosteroids","CAP patients","role of systemic corticosteroids","data","universal use of systemic corticosteroids","number of trials","reviewed diseases","infectious diseases","AOM","considerable number of physicians","treatment of acute pharyngitis","acute otitis media","pneumonia","community","respiratory tract infections","high-quality studies","order","risk of death","clinical course","indication","severe disease","years","effects","reason","methodological flaws","firm conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Despite the diseases caused by these nematodes, some advances towards the development of new therapeutic agents and attempts to develop effective vaccines against some of them, there has been limited progress in the development of practical diagnostic methods. The specific and sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock underpins effective disease control, which is now particularly important given the problems associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasite populations. Traditional diagnostic methods have major limitations, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This chapter provides an account of the significance of parasitic nematodes (order Strongylida), reviews conventional diagnostic techniques that are presently used routinely and describes advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections. A particular emphasis is placed on the recent development of a robotic PCR-based platform for high-throughput diagnosis, and its significance and implications for epidemiological investigations and for use in control programmes.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roeber, Florian; Jex, Aaron R.; Gasser, Robin B.","journal":"Advances in Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86d9877adb32094fa297b8740e557a7761058a11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150098.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124077058000045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23876874/; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-407705-8.00004-5; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124077058000045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significance of parasitic nematodes","based methods","development of practical diagnostic methods","Traditional diagnostic methods","Abstract Parasitic nematodes of livestock","specific diagnosis of nematode infections","sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock","recent development","advances","high-throughput diagnosis","effective disease control","robotic PCR-based platform","major limitations","development of new therapeutic agents","reviews conventional diagnostic techniques","control programmes","effective vaccines","major economic impact","order Strongylida","epidemiological investigations","use","implications","polymerase chain reaction","anthelmintic resistance","terms of sensitivity","problems","account","parasite populations","limited progress","particular emphasis","specificity","chapter","diseases"],"language":"en"},

However, there is a dearth of information on the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Africa, including Niger. METHODS: We implemented a retrospective study as part of national influenza sentinel surveillance in Niger. We randomly selected a sample of nasopharyngeal specimens collected from children \u003C5 years of age hospitalized with SARI from January 2010 through December 2012 in Niger. The samples were selected from individuals that tested negative by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A and B virus. The samples were analyzed using the Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21plus Kit (BioM\u00E9rieux, Luxemburg), which detects 23 respiratory pathogens including 18 viral and 5 bacterial agents. RESULTS: Among the 160 samples tested, 138 (86 %) tested positive for at least one viral or bacterial pathogen; in 22 (16 %) sample, only one pathogen was detected. We detected at least one respiratory virus in 126 (78 %) samples and at least one bacterium in 102 (64 %) samples. Respiratory syncytial virus (56/160; 35 %), rhinovirus (47/160; 29 %) and parainfluenza virus (39/160; 24 %) were the most common viral pathogens detected. Among bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (90/160; 56 %) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (20/160; 12 %) predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of certain viral and bacterial pathogens among children \u003C5 years of age with SARI highlights the need for continued and expanded surveillance in Niger.","publish_time":"2015-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lagare, Adamou; Ma\u00EFnassara, Halima Boubacar; Issaka, Bassira; Sidiki, Ali; Tempia, Stefano","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f55b841ff2d5939a229e9a7053d26e48b5139610.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4644278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26567015/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1251-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus pneumoniae"],"organizations":["SARI","Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["samples","bacterial pathogens","respiratory virus","Niger","common viral pathogens","Respiratory syncytial virus","children","SARI","B virus","Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens","bacterial agents","parainfluenza virus","years of age","etiology of severe acute respiratory illness","high prevalence of certain viral","national influenza sentinel surveillance","sub-Saharan Africa","expanded surveillance","sample of nasopharyngeal specimens","Haemophilus influenzae type b","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","rRT-PCR","Kit","mortality","highest burden","leading cause of morbidity","retrospective study","individuals","need","BioM\u00E9rieux","dearth of information","CONCLUSIONS","Asia","Luxemburg","Streptococcus pneumoniae","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","bacterium","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV entry is facilitated by the spike protein (S), which consists of an N-terminal domain (S1) responsible for cellular attachment and a C-terminal domain (S2) that mediates viral and host cell membrane fusion. The SARS-CoV S2 is a potential drug target, as peptidomimetics against S2 act as potent fusion inhibitors. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis and thermal stability experiments on electrostatic, hydrophobic, and polar residues to dissect their roles in stabilizing the S2 postfusion conformation was performed. It was shown that unlike the pH-independent retroviral fusion proteins, SARS-CoV S2 is stable over a wide pH range, supporting its ability to fuse at both the plasma membrane and endosome. A comprehensive SARS-CoV S2 analysis showed that specific hydrophobic positions at the C-terminal end of the HR2, rather than electrostatics are critical for fusion protein stabilization. Disruption of the conserved C-terminal hydrophobic residues destabilized the fusion core and reduced the melting temperature by 30\u00B0C. The importance of the C-terminal hydrophobic residues led us to identify a 42-residue substructure on the central core that is structurally conserved in all existing CoV S2 fusion proteins (root mean squared deviation = 0.4 \u00C5). This is the first study to identify such a conserved substructure and likely represents a common foundation to facilitate viral fusion. We have discussed the role of key residues in the design of fusion inhibitors and the potential of the substructure as a general target for the development of novel therapeutics against CoV infections.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aydin, Halil; Al-Khooly, Dina; Lee, Jeffrey E","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e866953830006644dc382a23b20fb5c69cd1a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4005712.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.2442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519901/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pro.2442","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing CoV S2 fusion proteins","fusion core","SARS-CoV entry","comprehensive SARS-CoV S2 analysis","S2 act","conserved C-terminal hydrophobic residues","CoV infections","SARS-coronavirus","design of fusion inhibitors","C-terminal domain","potent fusion inhibitors","fusion protein stabilization","C-terminal end","S2 postfusion conformation","host cell membrane fusion","conserved substructure","pH-independent retroviral fusion proteins","N-terminal domain","polar residues","specific hydrophobic positions","role of key residues","residue substructure","study","potential drug target","acute respiratory disease","general target","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","central core","spike protein","plasma membrane","wide pH range","root","peptidomimetics","mutagenesis","S1","cellular attachment","thermal stability experiments","development of novel therapeutics","squared deviation","electrostatics","HR2","roles","common foundation","site","importance","melting temperature","Disruption","endosome"],"language":"en"},

The present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of SSD of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia. The research results are expected to provide evidence for the establishment of a better management strategy. METHODS: This study enrolled a total of 140 ICU nurses who were selected by Jiangsu Province Hospital to work in Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China) on 3(rd) February 2020. A questionnaire \u201CSomatic Symptom Disorders for ICU Nurses in Wuhan No.1 Hospital\u201D was designed based on the \u201CInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\u201D (ICF). Exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms, and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms. RESULTS: Five major symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation (31.4%), dyspnea (30.7%), nausea (21.4%), headache (19.3%), and dizziness (17.9%). In exploratory factor analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and pain (nausea, headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, chest-discomfort-and-palpitation). In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors. CONCLUSION: The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters.

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.

Recently, we have demonstrated the existence of a potent antiviral property in the hemolymph of Lonomia obliqua caterpillars. The aim of this study was to produce an antiviral protein in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. The resulting bacmid contains the sequence coding for the antiviral protein previously described by our group. Total RNA from L. obliqua caterpillars was extracted with Trizol and used in the reverse transcription assay with oligo(d)T primer followed by polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with specific primers for the cDNA coding for the antiviral protein, based on the sequence deposited in the GenBank database. Restriction sites were inserted in the cDNA for ligation in the donor plasmid pFastBac1\u2122. The recombinant plasmid was selected in Escherichia coli DH5\u03B1 and subsequently used in the transformation of E. coli DH10Bac for the construction of the recombinant bacmid. This bacmid was used for the expression of the antiviral protein in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. After identifying the protein by western blot, activity tests were performed, showing that the purified recombinant protein was able to significantly reduce viral replication (about 4 logs).

Montmorillonite generally sustains drug release in many formulations by strongly adsorbing to the drug. In addition, montmorillonite enhances the dissolution rate and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs. Moreover, montmorillonite was applied to form composites with other polymer-based delivery systems.

In this review, perspectives of applying montmorillonite as a pharmaceutical excipient in drug delivery systems are discussed.","publish_time":"2016-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ju-Hwan; Shin, Hyeon-Jong; Kim, Min Hwan; Kim, Ji-Su; Kang, Naewon; Lee, Jae-Young; Kim, Ki-Taek; Lee, Jangik Ike; Kim, Dae-Duk","journal":"J Pharm Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/612f17cded1defc86125c686b933fde361879480.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100357.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40005-016-0258-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug release","diverse drug delivery systems","drug entrapment","high adsorption capacity of montmorillonite","release of drugs","pharmaceutical properties of drugs","dissolution rate","pharmaceutical fields","pharmaceutical excipient","polymer-based delivery systems","bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs","solubility","multifunctional clay mineral","unique characteristics","form composites","major component of bentonite","absorption","perspectives","addition","formulations","review"],"language":"en"},

Glycyrrhizic acid (GL), a triterpenoid glycoside, is the aqueous extract from licorice root. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has been reported to be a major bioactive hydrolysis product of GL and has been regarded as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases, including hepatitis. However, the mechanism by which GA inhibits viral hepatic inflammatory injury is not completely understood. In this study, we found that, by consecutively treating mice with a traditional herbal recipe, licorice plays an important role in the detoxification of mice. We also employed a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection model to illustrate that GA treatment inhibited activation of hepatic inflammatory responses by blocking high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) cytokine activity. Furthermore, decreased HMGB1 levels and downstream signaling triggered by injection of a neutralizing HMGB1 antibody or TLR4 gene deficiency, also significantly protected against MHV-induced severe hepatic injury. Thus, our findings characterize GA as a hepatoprotective therapy agent in hepatic infectious disease not only by suppressing HMGB1 release and blocking HMGB1 cytokine activity, but also via an underlying viral-induced HMGB1-TLR4 immunological regulation axis that occurs during the cytokine storm. The present study provides a new therapy strategy for the treatment of acute viral hepatitis in the clinical setting.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Xiaodong; Yu, Lijia; Zhang, Yinglin; Liu, Zequan; Zhang, Huawei; Zhang, Yansong; Liu, Ping; Du, Peishuang","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281c86ca7c47a589bba709b3ecbe1f7e8ebc3012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205693.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576919324439?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576919324439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416454/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106578","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMGB1 cytokine activity","HMGB1 release","GA treatment","viral hepatic inflammatory injury","neutralizing HMGB1 antibody","decreased HMGB1 levels","treatment of acute viral hepatitis","severe hepatic injury","activation of hepatic inflammatory responses","underlying viral-induced HMGB1-TLR4 immunological regulation axis","hepatic infectious disease","MHV","use of licorice","licorice root","cytokine storm","hepatoprotective therapy agent","variety of inflammatory diseases","murine hepatitis virus","anti-inflammatory agent","detoxification of mice","present study","Glycyrrhizic acid","Glycyrrhetinic acid","new therapy strategy","TLR4 gene deficiency","traditional herbal recipe","key ingredient of herbal remedies","major bioactive hydrolysis product of GL","infection model","high-mobility group box","important role","aqueous extract","injection","triterpenoid glycoside","clinical setting","findings","mechanism","Various human disorders"],"language":"en"},

Although the 2009 H1N1 is related genetically to swine influenza viruses, human infection has not been connected to pig exposure. Because the virus is now circulating widely in the human population, swine herds are at increased risk of becoming infected. In order to investigate potential outbreaks of the 2009 pandemic virus in pigs, a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the detection of the (H1N1) 2009 RNA in clinical specimens was developed. To evaluate the applicability of the test as a diagnostic tool in the screening of field specimens from swine, 64 field isolates of North American swine, 5 equine and 48 avian influenza viruses collected during diagnostic investigations were analyzed retrospectively as well as samples collected during an experimental in vivo infection with two novel H1N1 isolates, A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v virus and A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v. The sensitivity of the qRT-PCR was shown to be higher with respect to standard techniques such as virus isolation and the reproducibility was satisfactory. The present unique and highly sensitive assay is able to detect as little as 1\u00D7101 copies of RNA per \u03BCl of template and it represents a rapid and useful approach for the screening and quantitation of (H1N1) 2009 RNA in porcine specimens.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorusso, Alessio; Faaberg, Kay S.; Killian, Mary Lea; Koster, Leo; Vincent, Amy L.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f6e9801833a46fab7cf5bb97683baff0c19b518.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119756.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409005205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20005904/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409005205; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.12.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel H1N1 isolates","swine influenza viruses","virus isolation","pandemic virus","v virus","swine herds","screening of field specimens","field isolates of North American swine","avian influenza viruses","human infection","qRT-PCR","clinical specimens","porcine specimens","copies of RNA","diagnostic tool","diagnostic investigations","human population","quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","pigs","standard techniques","quantitation","California","increased risk","sensitive assay","useful approach","potential outbreaks","respect","\u03BCl of template","test","reproducibility","sensitivity","detection","Mexico","order","spring","applicability","samples","pig exposure","Abstract","humans"],"language":"en"},

Globally, Indigenous peoples may experience a different burden of ARI compared to non-Indigenous peoples. This protocol outlines our process for conducting a systematic review to investigate whether associations between ARI and seasonal or meteorological parameters differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups residing in the same geographical region. METHODOLOGY: A search string will be used to search PubMed(\u00AE), CAB Abstracts/CAB Direct(\u00A9), and Science Citation Index(\u00AE) aggregator databases. Articles will be screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria applied first at the title and abstract level, and then at the full article level by two independent reviewers. Articles maintained after full article screening will undergo risk of bias assessment and data will be extracted. Heterogeneity tests, meta-analysis, and forest and funnel plots will be used to synthesize the results of eligible studies. DISCUSSION AND REGISTRATION: This protocol paper describes our systematic review methods to identify and analyze relevant ARI, season, and meteorological literature with robust reporting. The results are intended to improve our understanding of potential associations between seasonal and meteorological parameters and ARI and, if identified, whether this association varies by place, population, or other characteristics.

To date, iPSCs of many species have been generated, whereas generation of bat iPSCs (biPSCs) has not been reported. To facilitate in-depth study of bats at the molecular and cellular levels, we describe the successful derivation of biPSCs with a piggyBac (PB) vector that contains eight reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog, cMyc, Lin28, Nr5a2, and miR302/367. These biPSCs were cultured in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor and three small molecule inhibitors (CHIR99021, PD0325901, and A8301). They retained normal karyotype, displayed alkaline phosphatase activity, and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, TBX3, and TRA-1-60. They could differentiate in vitro to form embryoid bodies and in vivo to form teratomas that contained tissue cells of all three germ layers. Generation of biPSCs will facilitate future studies on the mechanisms of antiviral immunity and longevity of bats at the cellular level.","publish_time":"2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo, Xiaohui; Li, Ning; Wu, Sen","journal":"Theriogenology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d56a6c78172633f889470e3139040fb17b9cf8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103130.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X14001800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X14001800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Generation of biPSCs","tissue cells","pluripotency markers Oct4","Nanog","Sox2","typical morphology of embryonic stem cells","successful derivation of biPSCs","generation of bat iPSCs","Abstract Induced pluripotent stem cells","express pluripotency markers","longevity of bats","cellular levels","reprogramming factors Oct4","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","in-depth study of bats","Klf4","small molecule inhibitors","leukemia inhibitory factor","alkaline phosphatase activity","future studies","mechanisms of antiviral immunity","CHIR99021","PD0325901","Lin28","vector","piggyBac","cMyc","normal karyotype","Nr5a2","teratomas","PB","media","TBX3","year","germ layers","species","embryoid bodies","miR302","A8301","date","germlines"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease. This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19\u201375 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43\u20132991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89\u20131029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26\u20130.82 \u00D7 10(3)/\u00B5l) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23\u20131.02 \u00D7 10(3)/\u00B5l). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients.

In 2012, a multivariate panel analysis developed by Chen and Haynes was applied to the Chinese regions to quantify the HSR impact on tourism output. The Chinese experience confirmed that, during the period 1999-2010, emerging high speed rail services did have significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. Since them, no similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyze and validate the suitability of this tool to assess empirically the effects of HSR on Spanish tourism during the period 1999-2014, and to enhance the abovementioned model with a tourism database. With more than 20 years\u2019 HSR experience, and operating the longest HSR network in Europe (2,900 km), Spain offers a good scenario for this model application because Spanish tourism sector represents 10.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Results clearly show that there is a direct linkage between the evolution of certain Spanish tourism outputs and the construction of the HSR network.

Until that time, coronaviruses had not been recognized as agents causing severe disease in humans, hence, the emergence of the SARS-CoV came as a complete surprise. Research during the past ten years has revealed the existence of a diverse pool of coronaviruses circulating among various bat species and other animals, suggesting that further introductions of highly pathogenic coronaviruses into the human population are not merely probable, but inevitable. The recent emergence of another coronavirus causing severe disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in humans, has made it clear that coronaviruses pose a major threat to human health, and that more research is urgently needed to elucidate their replication mechanisms, identify potential drug targets, and develop effective countermeasures. In this series, experts in many different aspects of coronavirus replication and disease will provide authoritative, up-to-date reviews of the following topics: \u2013 clinical management and infection control of SARS; \u2013 reservoir hosts of coronaviruses; \u2013 receptor recognition and cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV; \u2013 SARS-CoV evasion of innate immune responses; \u2013 structures and functions of individual coronaviral proteins; \u2013 anti-coronavirus drug discovery and development; and \u2013 the public health legacy of the SARS outbreak. Each article will be identified in the last line of its abstract as belonging to the series \u201CFrom SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.\u201D","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Peiris, Malik","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f305a879f5f54ea1af3d9ffab6e2c26b04dbea2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113673.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354213002234; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213002234; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","pathogenic coronaviruses","pathogenic human coronaviruses","severe disease","infection control of SARS","years of research","cross-species transmission of SARS","reservoir hosts of coronaviruses","diverse pool of coronaviruses","novel coronavirus","human health","Antiviral Research","SARS-CoV evasion of innate immune responses","anti-coronavirus drug discovery","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","different aspects of coronavirus replication","MERS","human population","humans","article","series of invited papers","Middle East respiratory syndrome","replication mechanisms","recent emergence","potential drug targets","various bat species","public health legacy","structures","functions of individual coronaviral proteins","receptor recognition","following topics","clinical management","development","up-to-date reviews","existence","anniversary","major threat","animals","southern China","experts","agents","effective countermeasures","introductions","complete surprise","line","time"],"language":"en"},

Relative quantitative data were obtained for 4455 proteins in BTV\u2010 and mock\u2010infected ST cells, among which 101 and 479 proteins were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h post\u2010infection, respectively, indicating further proteomic changes during the later stages of infection. Ten corresponding genes of differentially expressed proteins were validated via real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Expression levels of three representative proteins, eIF4a1, STAT1 and HSP27, were further confirmed via western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in biological processes related to innate immune response, signal transduction, nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription and apoptosis. Several upregulated proteins were associated with the RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptor signaling pathway and endocytosis. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate proteome\u2010wide dysregulation in BTV\u2010infected cells with the aid of quantitative proteomics.

Cases were identified using the World Health Organization\u0027s Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses\u2019 definition of severe pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for assessment by multiplex RT\u2010PCR for eight viruses and their subtypes, including RSV, influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. Blood cultures were collected from febrile participants. A total of 817 newborns were enrolled and followed with fortnightly surveillance for 2 years, accounting for a total of 1,501 child\u2010years of follow\u2010up. Of the nasopharyngeal swabs collected, 77.8% (179/230) were positive for one or more of the above mentioned respiratory viruses. The incidence of laboratory confirmed viral\u2010associated pneumonia was 11.9 per 100 child\u2010years of follow\u2010up. Enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in 51.7% patients, followed by parainfluenza virus type III (8.3%), and RSV (5.7%). Of the uncontaminated blood cultures, 1.4% (5/356) were positive.

Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3\u2032 sites are involved in binding with flavonoids.

Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates.

This tick-borne virus has infected more than 5,000 humans with a 6.4% to 20.9% fatality rate. Currently, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic measures against this virus. Historically, antibodies from patients who recovered from viral infection have been used to treat new patients. Until now, one recombinant monoclonal antibody was approved for the prophylaxis of respiratory syntial virus infection. We selected 10 antibodies from a patient who recovered from SFTS and found that one antibody potently inhibited SFTS viral infection in both test tube and animal studies. We determined the binding site of this antibody to SFTS virus, which allowed us to predict that this antibody could bind 247 out of 272 SFTS virus isolates reported up to now.

A convenience sample of approximately 3300 female Holstein calves born in 1991 on two large Florida dairy farms was used for the study. Data collected on each calf at birth included farm of origin, weight, height at the pelvis, birth date, and serum total protein (a measure of colostral immunoglobulin absorption). Birth season was dichotomized into summer and winter using meteorological data collected by University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations. Health data including date of initial treatment and number of treatments were collected for the diseases diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia. All calves were followed for 6 months. Cumulative incidences of mortality and occurrence of diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia were 0.12, 0.35, 0.11, 0.24 and 0.21, respectively. Serum total protein (TP) was a significant risk factor for mortality. The association of TP and mortality was quadratic and showed a dramatic decrease in mortality as TP increased from 4.0 to 5.0 g/dl, a small improvement from 5.0 to 6.0 g/dl and virtually no improvement in mortality rates as TP increased over 6.0 g/dl. The hazard mortality ratio was constant from birth to six months, indicating that the increased risk of mortality associated with low levels of TP was evident through six months of age. No interactions between TP, farm, season, or birth weight were found in these analyses. Serum total protein concentration was a significant risk factor for the occurrences, age of onset and severity of septicemia and pneumonia. The association between TP and septicemia was linear and an interaction with birth season was found. The association between TP and pneumonia was quadratic, and in contrast to the TP-and-septicemia relationship, the morbidity hazard ratio for pneumonia was not constant over the time measured; that is, colostral immunity protected the calf from developing pneumonia early in life, but this effect disappeared as the calf got older. Total protein was not a significant risk factor for diarrhea or omphalitis.","publish_time":"1998-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donovan, G.Arthur; Dohoo, Ian R.; Montgomery, David M.; Bennett, Fred L.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03aa0556aa6d712feb40fd557a3c0fd98338beda.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587797000603; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587797000603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["association of TP","Birth season","increased risk of mortality","birth date","birth weight","mortality rates","hazard mortality ratio","low levels of TP","developing pneumonia","months of age","significant risk factor","Serum total protein concentration","severity of septicemia","septicemia relationship","omphalitis","Cumulative incidences of mortality","calf health status","Health data","calf-level factors","occurrence of diarrhea","diseases diarrhea","meteorological data","age of onset","morbidity hazard ratio","farm of origin","colostral immunity","small improvement","date of initial treatment","female Holstein calves","prospective cohort study","measure of colostral immunoglobulin absorption","large Florida dairy farms","University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations","height","occurrences","winter","summer","pelvis","number of treatments","dramatic decrease","life","convenience sample","effect","time","interactions","contrast","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Few studies, however, have been devoted to coupling all the three diffusions together and representing their interactions. To fill the knowledge gap, this article proposes a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate a triple-diffusion process in a metropolitan area of 1 million people. The individual-based approach, network model, behavioral theories, and stochastic processes are used to formulate the three diffusions and integrate them together. Compared to the observed facts, the model results reasonably replicate the trends of influenza spread and information propagation. The model thus could be a valid and effective tool to evaluate information/behavior-based intervention strategies.

(Anacardiaceae) is an important representative of the genus Rhus, which contains over 250 individual species found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide. Rhus chinensis has long been used by folk medicine practitioners in Asia. Leaves, roots, stem, bark, fruit and particularly the galls on Rhus chinensis leaves, Galla chinensis, are recognized to have preventative and therapeutic effects on different ailments (such as diarrhea, dysentery, rectal and intestinal cancer, diabetes mellitus, sepsis, oral diseases and inflammation). However, it is critical to separate evidence from anecdote. Fortunately, recent scientific research has revealed that Rhus chinensis compounds possess strong antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal and antioxidant activities. Moreover, compounds isolated from the stem of Rhus chinensis significantly suppressed HIV\u20101 activity in vitro. Compounds from this plant were also found to inhibit enamel demineralization in vitro and enhance remineralization of dental enamel with fluoride.

Recently, we demonstrated KSHV infection of B- and endothelial cells to significantly upregulate the expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) which in turn enhances virus entry. This is an extension of the above study. In here, we determined EBV infection of cells to trigger IFITM1 expression, in vitro. Silencing IFITM1 expression using siRNA specifically lowered gammaherpesvirus infection of cells at a post binding stage of entry. A natural model system to explore the effect of IFITM1 on gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo is infection of BALB/c mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68). Priming mice with siRNA specific to IFITM1 significantly lowered MHV-68 titers in the lung specimens compared to priming with (NS)siRNA or PBS. MHV-68 titers were monitored by plaque assay and qPCR.

A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97\u201338.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09\u20135.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03\u20131.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00\u20131.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Leilei; Ren, Hui; Cao, Ruilin; Hu, Yueyang; Qin, Zeying; Li, Chuanen; Mei, Songli","journal":"Psychiatr Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79051a842916c78a2a766b266acb3a0a3428448f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173777.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["General Health Questionnaire","PTSD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["youth mental health","sampled youth","youth groups","factors of mental health","cross-sectional study","occurrence of COVID","effect of COVID","General Health Questionnaire","psychological problems","univariate logistic regression","cognitive status of COVID","effective psychological interventions","Univariate analysis","PTSD symptom","weeks","China","results","Negative coping styles scale","PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version","Post-traumatic stress disorder","PCL-C","coronavirus disease","symptoms","infectious diseases","local governments","educational level","occupation","GHQ","tendency","immense influence","remarkable evidence","suffering","enterprise employee","purposes","total"],"language":"en"},

Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). METHODS: Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. RESULTS: In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p \u003C 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p \u003C 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.","publish_time":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carri\u00F3n, Daniel; Kaali, Seyram; Kinney, Patrick L.; Owusu-Agyei, Seth; Chillrud, Steven; Yawson, Abena K.; Quinn, Ashlinn; Wylie, Blair; Ae-Ngibise, Kenneth; Lee, Alison G.; Tokarz, Rafal; Iddrisu, Luisa; Jack, Darby W.; Asante, Kwaku Poku","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cf3d012a747aadc8d8756951bd68985c0589f45b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6868532.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105150; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412019312723; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019312723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518936/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Moraxella"],"organizations":["HAP","CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAP","pneumonia cases","nasal microbial carriage","bacterial nasal carriage","exposure-response relationships","viral carriage","viral species presence","comparisons of microbial species presence","infant microbial nasal carriage","LPG","exposure-response analysis","Higher prevalence bacterial species","likelihood of bacterial","higher mean number of microbial species","study arm","stone arm participants","GRAPHS","routine personal exposure assessments","ITT analyses","infants","Data analyses","null results","healthy controls","intention","Ghana Randomized Air Pollution","household air pollution","Health Study","significant associations","cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions","Haemophilus influenzae","common respiratory microbes","Streptococcus pneumoniae","MassTag polymerase chain reaction","link","improved biomass","leading cause of childhood mortality","year of life","Moraxella catarrhalis","Nasopharyngeal swabs","findings","BACKGROUND","pollutant","METHODS","baseline","Mechanisms","studies","differences","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, substantial changes in Chinese society have been followed by a resurgent epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases. Sporadic reports have provided clues to the magnitude of the spread of syphilis, but a national surveillance effort is needed to provide data for planning and intervention. Methods We collected and assessed case report data from China\u0027s national sexually transmitted disease surveillance system and sentinel site network. Findings In 1993, the reported total rate of cases of syphilis in China was 0\u00B72 cases per 100 000, whereas primary and secondary syphilis alone represented 5\u00B77 cases per 100 000 persons in 2005. The rate of congenital syphilis increased greatly with an average yearly rise of 71\u00B79%, from 0\u00B701 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 1991 to 19\u00B768 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005.

A remaining concern associated with their production is the potential introduction of adventitious agents into their manufacturing process, which may compromise the pathogen safety of a product and potentially cause stock\u2010out situations for important medical supplies. To ensure the safety of biological therapeutics, regulatory guidance requires adventitious agent testing (AAT) of the bulk harvest. AAT is a deliberately promiscuous assay procedure which has been developed to indicate, ideally, the presence of any viral contaminant. One of the most important cell lines used in the production of biopharmaceuticals is Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and while viral infections of CHO cells have occurred, a systematic screen of their virus susceptibility has never been published. We investigated the susceptibility of CHO cells to infection by 14 different viruses, including members of 12 families and representatives or the very species that were implicated in previously reported production cell infections. Based on our results, four different infection outcomes were distinguished, based on the possible combinations of the two factors (i) the induction, or not, of a cytopathic effect and (ii) the ability, or not, to replicate in CHO cells. Our results demonstrate that the current AAT is effective for the detection of viruses which are able to replicate in CHO cells. Due to the restricted virus susceptibility of CHO cells and the routine AAT of bulk harvests, our results provide re\u2010assurance for the very high safety margins of CHO cell\u2010derived biopharmaceuticals.

We aim to compare the differences in presentation between influenza and non-influenza cases among those with febrile respiratory illness (FRI) to determine predictors of influenza infection. METHODS: Personnel with FRI (defined as fever\u226537.5\u00B0C, with cough or sore throat) were recruited from the sentinel surveillance system in the Singapore military. Nasal washes were collected, and tested using the Resplex II and additional PCR assays for etiological determination. Interviewer-administered questionnaires collected information on patient demographics and clinical features. Univariate comparison of the various parameters was conducted, with statistically significant parameters entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. The final multivariate model for influenza versus non-influenza cases was used to build a predictive probability clinical diagnostic model. RESULTS: 821 out of 2858 subjects recruited from 11 May 2009 to 25 Jun 2010 had influenza, of which 434 (52.9%) had 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 58 (7.1%) seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and 269 (32.8%) influenza B. Influenza-positive cases were significantly more likely to present with running nose, chills and rigors, ocular symptoms and higher temperature, and less likely with sore throat, photophobia, injected pharynx, and nausea/vomiting. Our clinical diagnostic model had a sensitivity of 65% (95% CI: 58%, 72%), specificity of 69% (95% CI: 62%, 75%), and overall accuracy of 68% (95% CI: 64%, 71%), performing significantly better than conventional influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria.

A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the NCBI and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level, 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in ORF regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95) respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.

While the breadth and prominence of biomaterials have increased exponentially over the past decades, critical challenges remain to be addressed, particularly in the development of biomaterials that exhibit highly specific functions. These functional properties are often encoded within the molecular structure of the component molecules. Proteins, as a consequence of their structural specificity, represent useful substrates for the construction of functional biomaterials through rational design. This chapter provides an in-depth survey of biomaterials constructed from coiled-coils, one of the best-understood protein structural motifs. We discuss the utility of this structurally diverse and functionally tunable class of proteins for the creation of novel biomaterials. This discussion illustrates the progress that has been made in the development of coiled-coil biomaterials by showcasing studies that bridge the gap between the academic science and potential technological impact.","publish_time":"2017-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conticello, Vincent; Hughes, Spencer; Modlin, Charles","journal":"Fibrous Proteins: Structures and Mechanisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d67bff9ccde5c4600bafe43484c386c8a11e332f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121611.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49674-0_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28101873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of biomaterials","coil biomaterials","prominence of biomaterials","construction of functional biomaterials","creation of novel biomaterials","in-depth survey of biomaterials","development of coiled","specific applications","structural specificity","coiled-coils","specific functions","functional properties","tunable class of proteins","protein structural motifs","useful substrates","academic science","important objective","potential technological impact","gap","best","studies","rational design","molecular structure","personalized medicine","past decades","component molecules","critical challenges","consequence","chapter","breadth","discussion","progress","utility"],"language":"en"},

To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated. A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61 days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six na\u00EFve calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two na\u00EFve calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA. RESULTS: All the EG calves seroconverted and showed clinical signs of respiratory disease. Viral RNA was detected from days 1\u201327 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27 days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease. CONCLUSION: Viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from the calves up to four weeks after exposure. The detection and amount of viral RNA corresponded well with the degree of respiratory signs. The calves were shedding infective virions for a considerable shorter period, and na\u00EFve calves introduced after four weeks were not infected.

Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined.

It is a new \u03B8-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction \u03B8 of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivorra, B.; Ferr\u00E1ndez, M.R.; Vela-P\u00E9rez, M.; Ramos, A.M.","journal":"Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/096b4e8b2eb39917f0017276339be437650cc797.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190554.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355435/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570420301350?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570420301350","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model parameters","mathematical model","general purpose model","spread of COVID","new \u03B8-SEIHRD model","incomplete reported data","impact of COVID","peak of daily reported cases","percentage of detected cases","fraction \u03B8 of detected cases","global magnitude of COVID","different values","real total infected cases","existence of infectious undetected cases","different scenarios","coronavirus disease","account","pandemic","particular case of China","Macao","Chinese Mainland","infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people","SIR","SEIR","Hong-Kong","Taiwan","World Health Organization","novel approach","reports","known special characteristics","early stages","needs of beds","affordable identification","ratio","novelties","good agreement","authorities","estimations","important effects","hospitals","importance","advantages","outputs","error","paper","country","policy makers","behavior","results","dates","countries"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages \u2264 49 years) and older (ages \u003E 49 years) persons using two-sided Student\u2019s t test. We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson\u2019s correlation test. RESULTS: ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle. ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland. ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue. In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females. In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally.

Conventional approaches, including culture, microscopy, and antigen-based tests have significant limitations such as limit of detection and the need for multiple procedures. Molecular diagnostics, especially PCR based tests, are rapidly changing research and practice in infectious diseases. Diarrheal disease, with its broad range of potential infectious etiologies, is well suited for multiplex molecular testing. This review highlights examples of currently employed molecular tests, as well as ways in which these tests can be applied in the future. The absence of a gold standard for the microbiologic cause of diarrhea means that the clinical significance of detected organisms may not always be clear. Conventional wisdom is that there should be one main pathogen causing diarrhea, however our thinking is challenged by increased detection of mixed infections. Thus, the successful incorporation of molecular diagnostics for diarrheal disease into practice will require both a careful understanding of the technical aspects and research to define their clinical utility.","publish_time":"2011-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Platts-Mills, James A.; Operario, Darwin J.; Houpt, Eric R.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eadfdc80f614e6c236b8a60a1e9c2af93a7b9990.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3253426.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-011-0223-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular tests","molecular testing","antigen-based tests","practice","successful incorporation of molecular diagnostics","Diarrheal disease","microbiologic cause of diarrhea","changing research","infectious diseases","clinical utility","Conventional approaches","Conventional wisdom","microbiologic etiology of enteric infection","clinical significance of detected organisms","increased detection of mixed infections","broad range of potential infectious etiologies","microscopy","significant limitations","gold standard","technical aspects","careful understanding","culture","thinking","PCR","review highlights examples","elusive goal","need","multiple procedures","ways","main pathogen","absence","future"],"language":"en"},

The intrusions of human into natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and the increasing poultry consumption by human have facilitated avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel adenovirus was exclusively found in birds causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans.

We strongly caution against the adoption of \u201Cthe COVID-19 Generation\u201D as a concept of study and instead offer several suggestions to researchers, organizations, and practitioners seeking answers to complicated questions about links between COVID-19 and various processes relevant to work, aging, and retirement during this time of uncertainty.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudolph, Cort W; Zacher, Hannes","journal":"Work Aging Retire","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e34641cde765d4db0253328f3dc2f3e175c1c0d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184414.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/workar/waaa009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","new generation","aging","emerging rhetoric","study of work","retirement","emerging issue","new construct","concept of study","global pandemic","various processes relevant","various media outlets","specific focus","practitioners","answers","complicated questions","attempts","links","organizations","practical lines","present evidence","distinct implications","researchers","real dangers","suggestions","presenting","time of uncertainty","commentary","narratives","adoption"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed over the recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin.

Adenoviruses express high amounts of non-coding virus associated (VA) RNAs able to saturate key factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) processing pathway, such as Exportin 5 and Dicer. Furthermore, a proportion of VA RNAs is cleaved by Dicer into viral microRNAs (mivaRNAs) that can saturate Argonaute, an essential protein for miRNA function. Thus, processing and function of cellular miRNAs is blocked in adenoviral-infected cells. However, viral miRNAs actively target the expression of cellular genes involved in relevant functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair or RNA regulation. Interestingly, the cellular silencing machinery is active at early times post-infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus\u2019 life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins. MAIN BODY: This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge. It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings. Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research. CONCLUSIONS: The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis. Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates. The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.","publish_time":"2019-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoeman, Dewald; Fielding, Burtram C.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cf9f507a18a00de76b8bb61a2c5c2b66680dd50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6537279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133031/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1182-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV proteins","SARS-CoV E","CoV life cycle","enzootic CoVs","CoV envelope","lethality of CoVs","novel human CoVs","viral life cycle","CoV molecular biology","recent progress","viral proteins","coronaviral research","current knowledge","Good progress","high mortality rate of certain CoVs","functions","future research","review","previous knowledge","pathogenesis","host cell proteins","critical aspects","structural motifs","Middle-East respiratory syndrome","enzootic infections","envelope formation","Recent studies","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","specific structural requirements","integral membrane protein","capable of infecting humans","production of effective anti-coronaviral agents","MERS","need","suggestions","consideration","discovery","relevance","ion-channelling viroporin","topology","similar nature","interactions","promising vaccine candidates","assembly","mechanisms","birds","mammals","ease of transmission","species barrier","Coronaviruses","gaps","new findings","MAIN BODY","BACKGROUND","decades","CONCLUSIONS","Data"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We used real-time TaqMan-based PCR to detect MWPyV in the feces (n = 174) of children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 887) from children with respiratory infections, and sera (n = 200) from healthy adults, and analyzed its clinical characteristics statistically. All the MWPyV-positive specimens were also screened for other common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Sixteen specimens were positive for MWPyV, including 13 (1.47%) respiratory samples and three (1.7%) fecal samples. The samples were all co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly with influenza viruses (69.2%) and human coronaviruses (30.7%). The MWPyV-positive children were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia or viral diarrhea. They ranged in age from 12 days to 9 years, and the most frequent symptoms were cough and fever. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR is an effective tool for the detection of MWPyV in different types of samples. MWPyV infection mainly occurs in young children, and fecal\u2013oral transmission is a possible route of its transmission.

However, progress in this area has been hindered due to the lack of carriers that can efficiently deliver siRNA to lung epithelial cells, and also due to challenges in developing oral inhalation (OI) formulations for the regional administration of siRNA and their carriers to the lungs. In this work we report the ability of generation four, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4NH2)\u2013siRNA complexes (dendriplexes) to silence the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene on A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells stably expressing eGFP. We also report the formulation of the dendriplexes and their aerosol characteristics in propellant-based portable OI devices. The size and gene silencing ability of the dendriplexes was seen not to be a strong function of the N/P ratio. Silencing efficiencies of up to 40% are reported. Stable dispersions of the dendriplexes encapsulated in mannitol and also in a biodegradable and water-soluble co-oligomer were prepared in hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs). Their aerosol characteristics were very favorable, and conducive to deep lung deposition, with respirable fractions of up to 77%. Importantly, siRNA formulated as dendriplexes in pMDIs was shown to keep its integrity after the particle preparation processes, and also after long-term exposures to HFA. The relevance of this study stems from the fact that this is the first work to report the formulation of inhalable siRNA with aerosol properties suitable to deep lung deposition using pMDIs devices that are the least expensive and most widely used portable inhalers. This study is relevant because, also for the first time, it shows that siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes can efficiently target lung alveolar epithelial A549 cells and silence genes even after siRNA has been exposed to the propellant environment.","publish_time":"2014-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conti, Denise S.; Brewer, Daniel; Grashik, Jordan; Avasarala, Sumant; da Rocha, Sandro R.

However, for the development of a durable RNAi-based gene therapy against HIV-1, multiple shRNAs need to be expressed simultaneously in order to avoid viral escape. In this study, we tested a multiple shRNA expression strategy for different shRNAs using repeated promoters in a lentiviral vector. Although highly effective in co-transfection experiments, a markedly reduced activity of each expressed shRNA was observed in transduced cells. We found that this reduced activity was due to recombination of the expression cassette repeat sequences during the transduction of the lentiviral vector, which resulted in deletions of one or multiple cassettes. To avoid recombination, we tested different promoters for multiple shRNA expression. We compared the activity of the human polymerase III promoters U6, H1, and 7SK and the polymerase II U1 promoter. Activities of these promoters were similar, irrespective of which shRNA was expressed. We showed that these four expression cassettes can be combined in a single lentiviral vector without causing recombination. Moreover, whereas HIV-1 could escape from a single shRNA, we now show that HIV-1 escape can be prevented when four shRNAs are simultaneously expressed in a cell.","publish_time":"2016-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brake, Olivier ter; Hooft, Karen \u0027t; Liu, Ying Poi; Centlivre, Mireille; Jasmijn von Eije, Karin; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Mol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01ab983c646e8e7f94df804205df6aaf13d987b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180777/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616314307; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616314307; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mt.6300382","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expressed shRNA","multiple shRNA expression strategy","single shRNA","HIV","multiple shRNAs","expression cassettes","single lentiviral vector","different promoters","recombination","multiple cassettes","repeated promoters","different shRNAs","promoters U6","reduced activity","human polymerase","viral escape","RNA interference","T cells","transduced cells","short hairpin RNA","Human immunodeficiency virus type","durable RNAi-based gene therapy","SK","H1","sequences","transduction","co-transfection experiments","deletions","U1 promoter","development","replication","order","Activities","study"],"language":"en"},

Gene expression profiling provides information on potential modes of action and human relevance, and tools have recently become available for pathway-based quantitative risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162\u03BCg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, dose\u2013response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourdon, Julie A.; Williams, Andrew; Kuo, Byron; Moffat, Ivy; White, Paul A.; Halappanavar, Sabina; Vogel, Ulla; Wallin, H\u00E5kan; Yauk, Carole L.","journal":"Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe201bcf1ed66856f693846cb0d07ce48051ec1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146762/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X12003666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.10.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300483X12003666","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human relevance","human health risk assessment of nanoparticles","context of human health risk assessment","human disease profiles","human fibrosis disease models","quantitative risk assessment","CBNP-exposed mice","induced gene expression changes","Gene expression profiling","perturbed pathways","published gene expression data","relevant pathway-specific expression changes","concomitant changes","inflammatory lung disease models","toxicogenomic profiles","pulmonary inflammation","pulmonary injury","similar fibrotic pathways","Analysis of CBNP","utility of toxicogenomics","knowledge of molecular pathways","minimum BMDs","apical endpoints","tissue injury","\u03BCg Printex","ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints","potential hazards","allergic airway inflammation","potential modes of action","carbon black nanoparticles","transcription factors","bacterial infection","networks","response characteristics","predicted phenotypes","information","chemical toxicities","tools","C57BL","important step","Comparison","Benchmark doses","exposure","nanomaterials","genotoxicity","Abstract New approaches","study","synthesis","objective","time"],"language":"en"},

Increased resilience to stress via increased biodiversity has been described in a number of natural systems. Diversity in food production can be considered on the following three levels: (a) genetic diversity as reflected in the range of cultivars which can be selected for production; (b) species diversity, captured through production of a wide range of crops on each farm; and (c) broad ecosystem diversity, described by the diversity of production between farms and within the broader food system. A network of locally based food producers and entrepreneurs provides opportunity for high diversity at each network stage, with increased adaptive capacity and the ability for rapid response to disturbance. We argue that production techniques that use carefully planned diverse plantings, such as biointensive cultivation, increase resilience by increased water use efficiency, yield and nutrient retention while reducing pressure from pests and pathogens. We present a model for a diverse, distributed food system in the North Carolina Piedmont and analyze an existing distributed network by a food hub in South Carolina. Through these models, we argue that a shift in the food network has the potential to increase local food security by having food more reliably available where it is needed and by contributing to local resilience through community economic development. The shift in food production and distribution systems serves multiple goals: When crop loss occurs, other crops still contribute to overall harvest, reducing net loss. Diverse on-farm production can support a more distributed network of food aggregators, processors, and markets than the current approach of large-scale consolidation. Finally, a distributed food supply network supported with diverse agricultural products can increase resilience by providing access to diversified markets for producers and improved food access to consumers with more food choices, while expanding the need for skilled jobs supporting the regionally based food industry.","publish_time":"2015-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacFall, Janet; Lelekacs, Joanna Massey; LeVasseur, Todd; Moore, Steve; Walker, Jennifer","journal":"J Environ Stud Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13d91249163f26ec4be4fe3e622a40ff89868be2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226709/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-015-0321-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Carolina"],"keyphrases":["food production","food network","food hub","food choices","distributed food system","diversity of production","distributed food supply network","distributed network of food aggregators","based food producers","local food security","improved food access","broader food system","based food industry","Increased resilience","agricultural diversity","farm production","high diversity","production techniques","species diversity","genetic diversity","existing distributed network","network stage","local resilience","strengthened resilience","broad ecosystem diversity","diverse plantings","increased biodiversity","diverse agricultural products","increased adaptive capacity","increased water use efficiency","shift","wide range of crops","number of natural systems","diversified markets","distribution systems","South Carolina","crop loss","net loss","natural perturbations","range of cultivars","North Carolina Piedmont","opportunity","multiple goals","ability","entrepreneurs","consumers","processors","nutrient retention","biointensive cultivation","farms","potential","rapid response","skilled jobs","pressure","pests","current approach of large-scale consolidation","overall harvest","need","community economic development","disturbance","levels","pathogens","models"],"language":"en"},

Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient\u2019s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e825bacfdd689ef830cd0126334ac2f5d3910711.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159862.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300850; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311651/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 activity","patients","low cytosolic pH values","ARBs","ACE2 enzyme","Activation","increased sympathetic activity","cardiac ACE2 levels","RAS increases","presence of diabetes mellitus","use of ACEIs","renin-angiotensin system","increased morbidity","brain stem","release of angiotensin","cell","infection","sympathetic nervous system","patient\u2019s blood pressure increases","cardiac arrhythmias","mortality of COVID","central stimulation","obesity","rostral ventrolateral medulla","smoking","comorbid conditions","systemic vasoconstriction","old age","hypertension","pulmonary capillary leaking","importance","important event","myocarditis","reduction","ARDS","viral load","novel coronavirus disease","mechanisms","outbreak","heart tissue","result"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we describe a new method for investigating the autoprocessing mechanism of the main protease (M (pro)), which is also called the 3C\u2010like protease (3CL (pro)). Using our method, we measured the activities, under the same conditions, of the mature form and pro\u2010forms with the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence, the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence or both pro\u2010sequences, toward the pro\u2010form with both N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequences. The data indicate that the pro\u2010forms of the enzyme have proteolytic activity, and are stimulated by the same proteolytic activity. The stimulation occurs in two steps, with approximately eightfold stimulation by N\u2010terminal cleavage, approximately fourfold stimulation by C\u2010terminal cleavage, and 23\u2010fold stimulation by the cleavage of both termini, compared to the pro\u2010form with both the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequences. Such cleavage mainly occurs in a trans manner; i.e. the pro\u2010form dimer cleaves the monomeric form. The stimulation by N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence removal is due to the cis (intra\u2010dimer and inter\u2010protomer) effect of formation of the new N\u2010terminus, whereas that by C\u2010terminal cleavage is due to removal of its trans (inter\u2010dimer) inhibitory effect. A numerical simulation of the maturation pathway is presented.","publish_time":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muramatsu, Tomonari; Kim, Yong\u2010Tae; Nishii, Wataru; Terada, Takaho; Shirouzu, Mikako; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/827103fa191ba00e6b77c07e58b39204bf13fd22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452147/; https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["terminal pro\u2010sequences","pro\u2010forms","terminal cleavage","pro\u2010form dimer","terminal pro\u2010sequence removal","new N","mature form","monomeric form","fourfold stimulation","eightfold stimulation","proteolytic activity","inter\u2010dimer","autoprocessing mechanism","intra\u2010dimer","new method","polyproteins","viral proteases","anti\u2010SARS","inter\u2010protomer","effect of formation","inhibitory effect","trans manner","main protease","CoV drug design","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","RNA viruses","point of view","terminus","enzyme","termini","numerical simulation","maturation pathway","conditions","steps","non\u2010structural proteins","activities","paper","data"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aim to analyze the current evidence and findings associated with influenza and other emergent viral infections, namely, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Among medical conditions, community-acquired respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for ventilatory support in ICUs. Community-acquired pneumonia in a severe form including the need of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors is associated with high mortality rates. However, after the pandemic that occurred in 2009 by H1N1 influenza, the number of cases being admitted to ICUs with viral infections is on the rise. Patients in whom an etiology would not have been identified in the past are currently being tested with more sensitive viral molecular diagnostic tools, and patients being admitted to ICUs have more preexisting medical conditions that can predispose to viral infections. Viral infections can trigger the dysregulation of the immune system by inducing a massive cytokine response. This cytokine storm can cause endothelial damage and dysfunction, deregulation of coagulation, and, consequently, alteration of microvascular permeability, tissue edema, and shock. In severe influenza, this vascular hyperpermeability can lead to acute lung injury, multiorgan failure, and encephalopathy. In immunocompetent patients, the most common viral infections are respiratory, and influenza should be considered in patients with severe respiratory failure being admitted to ICU. Seasonality and coinfection are two important features when considering influenza as a pathogen in critically ill patients. Herpesviridae (HSV, CMV, and EBV) may reactivate in ICU patients, and their reactivation is associated with morbidity/mortality. However, whether a specific treatment may impact on outcome remains to be determined.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cantan, Ben; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e67b6e20ffe387ec2d2ad69b818748c6cec2689a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585475/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1693497","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","respiratory infections","ill patients","emergent viral infections","common viral infections","severe influenza","immunocompetent patients","H1N1 influenza","ICUs","severe respiratory failure","EBV","sensitive viral molecular diagnostic tools","severe form","HSV","community","CMV","preexisting medical conditions","multiorgan failure","cytokine storm","Epstein-Barr virus","massive cytokine response","high mortality rates","herpes simplex virus type","vasopressors","acute lung injury","frequent reason","endothelial damage","vascular hyperpermeability","tissue edema","dysfunction","need of invasive mechanical ventilation","intensive care unit","alteration of microvascular permeability","immune system","important features","number of cases","deregulation of coagulation","ventilatory support","findings","dysregulation","reactivation","pathogen","multiple reasons","Seasonality","coinfection","shock","encephalopathy","current evidence","pneumonia","cytomegalovirus","specific treatment","outcome","morbidity","Herpesviridae","rise","pandemic","etiology","study","past"],"language":"en"},

Sheep and goats in particularly contribute significantly towards the upliftment of livelihood of the poor and marginal farmers in these regions. In this context, PPR directly affecting the viability of sheep and goat husbandry has emerged as a major hurdle in the development of these regions. The control of PPR in these regions could significantly contribute to poverty alleviation, therefore, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) have targeted the control and eradication of PPR by 2030 a priority. In order to achieve this goal, a potent, safe and efficacious live-attenuated PPR vaccine with long-lasting immunity is available for immunoprophylaxis. However, the live-attenuated PPR vaccine is thermolabile and needs maintenance of an effective cold chain to deliver into the field. In addition, the infected animals cannot be differentiated from vaccinated animals. To overcome these limitations, some recombinant vaccines have been developed.

The purpose of this study was to determine if porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection increases genetic variability of PRRSV during serial passages in pigs and to determine if there is a difference in the PRRSV mutation rate between pigs concurrently infected with PCV2a or PCV2b. After 8 consecutive passages of PRRSV alone (group 1), PRRSV with PCV2a (group 2), or PCV2b (group 3) in pigs, the sequences of PRRSV structural genes for open reading frame (ORF) 5, ORF6, ORF7 and the partial non-structural protein gene (Nsp) 2 were determined. The total number of identified amino acid mutations in ORF5, ORF6, ORF7 and Nsp2 sequences was 30 for PRRSV infection only, 63 for PRRSV/PCV2a concurrent infection, and 77 for PRRSV/PCV2b concurrent infection when compared with the original VR2385 virus used to infect the passage 1 pigs. Compared to what occurred in pigs infected with PRRSV only, the mutation rates in ORF5 and ORF6 were significantly higher for concurrent PRRSV/PCV2b infected pigs. The PRRSV/PCV2a pigs had a significantly higher mutation rate in ORF7. The results from this study indicated that, besides ORF5 and Nsp2, the PRRSV structural genes ORF6 and ORF7 were shown to mutate at various degrees when the PRRSV was passaged over time in vivo. Furthermore, a significantly higher mutation rate of PRRSV was observed when pigs were co-infected with PCV2 highlighting the importance of concurrent infections on PRRSV evolution and control.","publish_time":"2013-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Shuang-Hui; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Beach, Nathan M.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Halbur, Patrick G.; Opriessnig, Tanja","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bcb2a658a05235e339239286458a3bb784d62c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126594.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213002992; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036229/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213002992","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concurrent PRRSV","PRRSV infection","PRRSV evolution","PRRSV mutation rate","genetic variability of PRRSV","higher mutation rate of PRRSV","consecutive passages of PRRSV","PRRSV structural genes ORF6","PCV2a pigs","sequences of PRRSV structural genes","PCV2b infected pigs","ORF7","PCV2b concurrent infection","PCV2a concurrent infection","ORF5","group","mutation rates","importance of concurrent infections","Nsp2 sequences","study","antigenic variability","serial passages","respiratory syndrome virus","high degree of genetic","porcine circovirus type","original VR2385 virus","open reading frame","amino acid mutations","partial non-structural protein gene","total number","control","difference","various degrees","purpose","results","time"],"language":"en"},

As respiratory tract viral infections have been shown to induce wheeze in infancy, we investigated the relationship between CB progenitor function and phenotype and acute respiratory illness (ARI), specifically wheeze and fever. CB from 39 high\u2010risk infants was studied by flow cytometry for CD34(\u002B) progenitor phenotype and by ex vivo Eo/B\u2010colony forming unit (CFU) responses to cytokine stimulation in relation to ARI in the first year of life.

The aim of present studies was to characterize innate immune responses capable of inhibiting infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) replication in chicken lungs after in ovo administration of CpG ODN. In our experiments, CpG ODN 2007 or PBS solution was injected on 18th embryonic day (ED) via the chorioallontoic route. CpG ODN and PBS inoculated embryos were challenged with virulent IBV on the 19th ED. Lung tissue samples from experimental chicks were analysed for cytokines/chemokines gene expression at 24h, 48h, and 72h, post infection. Our data showed significant differential up-regulation of IFN-\u03B3, IL-8 (CXCLi2) and MIP-1\u03B2 genes and suppression of IL-6 gene expression being associated with inhibition of IBV replication in lungs tissue retrieved from embryos pre-treated with CpG ODN. It is expected that understanding of the innate immune modulation of target tissues by the virus and innate immune stimulants will be helpful in identification of valuable targets for development of novel, safe, effective and economical control strategies against IBV infection in chickens.","publish_time":"2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dar, Arshud; Tikoo, Suresh; Potter, Andy; Babiuk, Lorne A.; Townsend, Hugh; Gerdts, Volker; Mutwiri, George","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1e51ddaf62f6aa3aff9b2d6562f5070bb5b7cc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112892.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242714001172; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012000/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242714001172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["CpG ODN","PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune stimulants","innate immune system","inhibiting virus replication","process of virus replication","inhibition of IBV replication","innate immune responses capable","IBV infection","virus interaction","innate immune modulation of target tissues","virulent IBV","ovo administration of CpG ODN","infectious bronchitis virus","lungs tissue","chemokines gene expression","set of cytokines","host cells","PBS inoculated embryos","Alteration of cytokines profiles","chicken lungs","suppression of IL","PBS solution","result of host","permissive cells","post infection","Lung tissue samples","economical control strategies","development of novel","manipulation","identification of valuable targets","regulation of IFN","experimental chicks","antiviral substances","\u03B2 genes","significant differential","MIP","embryonic day","CXCLi2","chickens","aim of present studies","data","experiments","chorioallontoic route"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners\u2019 consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial. Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that do not require antibiotic therapy.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cots, Josep M.; Al\u00F3s, Juan-Ignacio; B\u00E1rcena, Mario; Boleda, Xavier; Ca\u00F1ada, Jos\u00E9 L.; G\u00F3mez, Niceto; Mendoza, Ana; Vilaseca, Isabel; Llor, Carles","journal":"Acta Otorrinolaringol\u00F3gica Espa\u00F1ola","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f11716e871f586d06f32e591b126474d64423401.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124194.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001651915000084; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001651915000084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neither"],"organizations":["FAA bacteriana","rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The aim of the treatment","the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis","The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate","one of the most common infectious","most of which","reducing the contagious","the main agent","The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper","In the diagnostic process","of predictive clinical","not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection","of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available","management algorithms that include the","resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics","FAA bacteriana","Penicillin and amoxicillin","Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that","an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs","tratamiento inicial","tratamiento antibi\u00F3tico","manejo diagn\u00F3stico","span and preventing local suppurative and non","sobrediagn\u00F3stico de FAA estreptoc\u00F3cica","Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults","prescripci\u00F3n de antibi\u00F3ticos","antibi\u00F3ticos de elecci\u00F3n","posible etiolog\u00EDa bacteriana","seen in general practitioners","and rapid tests have been set up","not performed","Among bacterial","haemolytic streptococcus","Viral aetiology","pacientes","algoritmos de manejo","penicilina","casos","Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2","not require antibiotic therapy","t\u00E9cnica de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","they should be reserved for patients allergic","clinical assessment","macrolides indicated as first","line therapy","estreptococo \u03B2","suppurative complications","primera elecci\u00F3n","infecci\u00F3n aguda","asociaci\u00F3n de amoxicilina","faringoamigdalitis aguda","better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test","can help clinicians","consiguiente prescripci\u00F3n innecesaria","escalas de valoraci\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica","complicaciones supurativas locales","t\u00E9cnicas de detecci\u00F3n r\u00E1pida","speeding up symptom resolution","principal agente responsable","grupo","veces","uso","Consequently","buena ayuda","broad spectrum","actuaci\u00F3n","farmacias comunitarias","enfermedades infecciosas","tiempo de contagio","ant\u00EDgeno estreptoc\u00F3cico","Neither","adulto","consultations","GABHS","evidencia cient\u00EDfica disponible","If these","implantaci\u00F3n de protocolos","s\u00EDntomas","EBHGA","utilidad","amplio espectro","alergia","resoluci\u00F3n","m\u00E9dico de familia","causante","pa\u00EDs","objetivos","macr\u00F3lidos"],"language":"es"},

Repositioning hydroxychloroquine (HQ) seems to be a promising option. Many emerging evidences have converged on the effectiveness of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In a recent paper, Gautret et al. suggested that further works are needed to determine if HQ antiviral prophylaxis is useful, especially for healthcare workers. Methods The purpose of this paper is to assess the Covid-19 exposure and risks level among caregivers. For this, we performed research on internet and PubMed by crossing the following keywords: healthcare givers, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, coronavirus, Covid-19, mortality, infection rate, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine. Results Data on healthcare worker\u0027s infection and mortality by Covid-19 are partial and are not systematically published. However, it seems that the infection rate varies between 3.8% and 9% depending on the country. Moreover, the mean age of this population is relatively old, especially in the OECD area. Conclusions Anti-Covid-19 HQ prophylaxis should be urgently accessed, especially for healthcare workers. It is to be hoped that HQ prophylaxis reduces the morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection among this population which is particularly exposed and relatively old.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassani, Rachid Tahiri Joutei; Bennis, Ahmed","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbfd3eb6465117653ee7725608dd635853cd7888.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120304718; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120304718?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthcare workers","HQ prophylaxis","healthcare worker\u0027s infection","treatment of Covid","infection rate","mortality","healthcare givers","effectiveness of HQ","HQ antiviral prophylaxis","Conclusions Anti-Covid","population","recent paper","Repositioning hydroxychloroquine","new coronavirus pandemic","doctors","world","following keywords","onset","nurses","Results Data","PubMed","exposure","risks level","morbidity","public health emergency","internet","caregivers","Gautret","Abstract Background","mean age","emerging evidences","research","OECD area","Methods","purpose","works","promising option","country"],"language":"en"},

The bioactive lipid amide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), due to several distinctive homeostatic properties, including anti-inflammatory activities, modulation of immune response, and anti-oxidant effects can be considered as a novel potential pharmacological alternative for the management of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghaffari, Samad; Roshanravan, Neda; Tutunchi, Helda; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Pouraghaei, Mahboub; Kafil, Behnam","journal":"Arch Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/224679a1209bc3e23670f6998b37b114f0b93a55.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920304756?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920304756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327293/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective drugs","effective agents","management of COVID","current outbreak of COVID","lack of effective pharmaceutical treatment","Bioactive lipids","potential adjuvant therapy","distinctive homeostatic properties","array of known health","bioactive lipid amide","World Health Organization","novel potential pharmacological alternative","anti-inflammatory activities","modulation of immune response","alleviating acute respiratory stress","OEA","anti-oxidant effects","oleoylethanolamide","urgent need","regard","coronavirus","emergence","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

One hundred and fourteen children aged 6\u201314 years with chronic stable asthma and on regular inhaled steroid were monitored for respiratory symptoms over a full calendar year from recruitment. They would attend the study clinic if peak expiratory flow rate decreased to below 80% of their baselines, if they met a predefined symptom score, or if parents subjectively felt them developing a cold. Virological diagnosis using virus culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction methods on nasal swab specimens would be attempted for all these visits irrespective of triggers. Physician diagnosed outcome of each episode was documented. Three hundred and five episodes of respiratory illnesses were captured in the cohort. Nasal specimens were available in 166 episodes, 92 of which were diagnosed as asthma exacerbations, and 74 non-asthma related episodes. Respiratory viruses were detected in 61 of 166 episodes (36.7%). There was no significant difference in virus detection rate between asthma exacerbations (32 out of 97 episodes, 34.8%) and non-asthma respiratory illnesses (29 out of 79 episodes, 39.2%). Although newly discovered respiratory viruses were identified in these episodes, rhinovirus was the commonest organism associated with both asthma exacerbations and non-asthma related episodes. Plausible explanations for much lower virus detection rate than previously reported include improved personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken during respiratory tract infections in the immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period together with a significant contribution of other adverse factors like environmental air pollution. We conclude that not all viral infections in children with asthma lead to an asthma exacerbation and the attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations in children vary across different time periods and across different localities.","publish_time":"2011-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, So-lun; Chiu, Shui-seng Susan; Malik, Peiris Joseph S.; Chan, Kwok-hung; Wong, Hing-sang Wilfred; Lau, Yu-lung","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ee377ece8b8a1fb6a4468d39d410f0f33042051.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3175036.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-011-1446-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21448631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["asthma lead","non-asthma respiratory illnesses","non-asthma related episodes","episodes of respiratory illnesses","respiratory symptoms","chronic stable asthma","attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations","respiratory tract infections","children","discovered respiratory viruses","effect of different respiratory viral infections","lower virus detection rate","different localities","antigen detection","immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period","different time periods","virus culture","Nasal specimens","nasal swab specimens","prospective cohort study","significant contribution","discovered ones","peak expiratory flow rate","significant difference","study clinic","polymerase chain reaction methods","precautionary measures","regular inhaled steroid","adverse factors","improved personal hygiene","commonest organism","Virological diagnosis","environmental air pollution","Plausible explanations","parents","calendar year","years","Hong Kong","predefined symptom score","rhinovirus","Physician","outcome","recruitment","baselines","visits"],"language":"en"},

One of the first immune cell types to encounter danger is the macrophage. Macrophages sense danger signals such as extracellular ATP or bacterial toxins, derived from tissue damage or infection, and initiate the activation of an intracellular molecular complex called the inflammasome. The inflammasome consists of a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, an adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a CARD) and the protease caspase\u20101. Assembly of the complex leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase\u20101 that triggers processing and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03B2 and IL\u201018, and ultimately cell death via the process of pyroptosis. The ability to sense and respond to danger appropriately is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of inflammasomes contributes to the progression of chronic diseases prevalent in the ageing population, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, COPD and metabolic disease; hence, it is critical that activation of the inflammatory response and inflammasome activation are tightly regulated. Post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs) such as ubiquitination have recently emerged as important regulators of inflammasome assembly. However, the mechanisms by which PTMs regulate the inflammasome are still not understood. This review aims to summarize our knowledge to date on how the ubiquitin system controls inflammasome activation and where this area of research is heading.","publish_time":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopez\u2010Castejon, Gloria","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ee4771069f4bfe44f158be9946ed968f743cb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679183/; https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of caspase","ubiquitin system controls inflammasome activation","important regulators of inflammasome assembly","Macrophages sense danger signals","PTMs","immune cell types","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","metabolic disease","inflammatory response","body\u2019s response","cell death","immune homeostasis","protease caspase","intracellular molecular complex","adaptor molecule ASC","extracellular ATP","associated speck","apoptosis","ageing population","cytosolic pattern recognition receptor","bacterial toxins","progression of chronic diseases prevalent","cytokines interleukin","tissue damage","protein","date","CARD","processing","ubiquitination","release","COPD","Post\u2010translational modifications","knowledge","process of pyroptosis","infection","Inflammation","area of research","cleavage","Dysregulation of inflammasomes","mechanisms","review","ability"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Eleven patients with septic shock requiring norepinephrine after fluid resuscitation were included \u003C24 hours after ICU arrival. Study enrolment and insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter was performed after written informed consent from the next of kin. Norepinephrine infusion was titrated to target mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60, 75 and 90 mmHg in a random sequential order.

These triggers may be allergenic or nonallergenic. Allergenic triggers include indoor allergens, such as house dust mites (HDMs), molds, pets, cockroaches, and rodents, and outdoor allergens, such as pollens and molds. Clinical observations provide support for the role of HDM exposure as a trigger, although avoidance studies provide conflicting results. Molds and their metabolic products are now considered to be triggers of asthma attacks. Pets, dogs, and especially cats can undoubtedly trigger asthmatic symptoms in sensitized subjects. Avoidance is difficult and rarely adhered to by families. Cockroach allergens contribute to asthma morbidity, and avoidance strategies can lead to clinical benefit. Mouse allergens are mostly found in inner-city dwellings, but their implication in asthma morbidity is debated. In the outdoors, pollens can induce seasonal asthma in sensitized individuals. Avoidance relies on preventing pollens from getting into the house and on minimizing seasonal outdoor exposure. Outdoor molds may lead to severe asthma exacerbations. Nonallergenic triggers include viral infections, active and passive smoking, meteorological changes, occupational exposures, and other triggers that are less commonly involved. Viral infection is the main asthma trigger in children. Active smoking is associated with higher asthma morbidity, and smoking cessation interventions should be personalized. Passive smoking is also a risk factor for asthma exacerbation. The implementation of public smoking bans has led to a reduction in the hospitalization of asthmatic children. Air pollution levels have been linked with asthmatic symptoms, a decrease in lung function, and increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Since avoidance is not easy to achieve, clean air policies remain the most effective strategy. Indoor air is also affected by air pollutants, such as cigarette smoke and volatile organic compounds generated by building and cleaning materials. Occupational exposures include work-exacerbated asthma and work-related asthma.","publish_time":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gautier, Clarisse; Charpin, Denis","journal":"J Asthma Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee106840a4b1667303e4b84d25795de3617bd7ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5349698.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28331347/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jaa.s121276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Allergenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma triggers","seasonal asthma","work-related asthma","asthma attacks","higher asthma morbidity","main asthma trigger","work-exacerbated asthma","severe asthma exacerbations","Nonallergenic triggers","Active smoking","passive smoking","outdoor allergens","Outdoor molds","indoor allergens","Indoor air","avoidance strategies","pollens","avoidance studies","asthmatic symptoms","air pollutants","Cockroach allergens","Mouse allergens","smoking cessation interventions","seasonal outdoor exposure","occupational exposures","implementation of public smoking bans","clean air policies","Air pollution levels","hospitalization of asthmatic children","pets","viral infections","sensitized subjects","sensitized individuals","Clinical observations","clinical benefit","house dust mites","role of HDM exposure","lung function","cigarette smoke","meteorological changes","increased emergency room","volatile organic compounds","support","decrease","HDMs","reduction","risk factor","basis of environmental secondary prevention","inner-city dwellings","cats","implication","cockroaches","rodents","effective strategy","conflicting results","hospitalizations","outdoors","cleaning materials","dogs","metabolic products","families"],"language":"en"},

Of the 29 children infected with HBoV, 16 (55.2%) were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Viral coinfection with HBoV did not affect the severity of the respiratory disease (P = 0.291). The number of HBoV genome copies ranged from 5.80 \u00D7 10(2) to 9.72 \u00D7 10(8) copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirates among HBoV\u2010positive specimens by real\u2010time PCR, and neither coinfection nor the severity of disease correlated with the viral load (P = 0.148, P = 0.354, respectively). The most common clinical features were cough and acute upper respiratory infection, and acute bronchopneumonia. Additionally, the NP\u20101 gene of HBoV showed minimal sequence variation. These data suggest that HBoV is frequent in young children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China, and RSV is the most common coinfecting virus. There was no apparent association between the viral load of HBoV and coinfection or disease severity. The NP\u20101 gene was highly conserved in HBoV. J. Med.

Here, we aimed to demonstrate the antiviral activity of RS, especially against influenza A virus (IFV) infection, in vitro and in vivo. RS showed inhibitory effects on viral proliferation of enveloped viruses in vitro. Evaluation of the anti-IFV activity of RS in vitro showed that it inhibited both virus adsorption and entry steps. The oral administration of RS in IFV-infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice suppressed viral proliferation in both mouse types. The oral administration of RS also had stimulatory effects on neutralizing antibody production. Fluorescent analysis showed that RS colocalized with M cells in Peyer\u0027s patches, suggesting that RS bound to the M cells and may be incorporated into the Peyer\u0027s patches, which are essential to intestinal immunity. In summary, RS inhibits influenza virus infection and promotes antibody production, suggesting that RS is a potential candidate for the treatment of influenza virus infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terasawa, Masahiro; Hayashi, Kyoko; Lee, Jung-Bum; Nishiura, Kaoru; Matsuda, Koichi; Hayashi, Toshimitsu; Kawahara, Toshio","journal":"Marine drugs","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md18050254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral administration of RS","anti-IFV activity of RS","antiviral activity of RS","Influenza viruses","treatment of influenza virus infections","new anti-influenza virus agents","virus adsorption","availability of anti-influenza drugs","Peyer\u0027s patches","cells","viral proliferation of enveloped viruses","IFV-infected immunocompetent","neutralizing antibody production","stimulatory effects","inhibitory effects","year","immunocompromised mice","significant public health burden","sulfated polysaccharide","green alga Monostroma nitidum","potential candidate","vaccines","summary","mouse types","entry steps","Evaluation","intestinal immunity","Rhamnan sulfate","Fluorescent analysis"],"language":"en"},

A global platform to communicate and share the research on these diseases is needed to facilitate the translation of knowledge into effective approaches and tools for their elimination. Based on the \u201COne health, One world\u201D mission, a new, open-access journal, Infectious Diseases of Poverty (IDP), was launched by BioMed Central in partnership with the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on October 25, 2012. Its aim is to identify and assess research and information gaps that hinder progress towards new interventions for a particular public health problem in the developing world. From the inaugural IDP issue of October 25, 2012, a total of 256 manuscripts have been published over the following five years. Apart from a small number of editorials, opinions, commentaries and letters to the editor, the predominant types of publications are research articles (69.5%) and scoping reviews (21.5%). A total of 1 081 contributing authors divided between 323 affiliations across 68 countries, territories and regions produced these 256 publications. The journal is indexed in major international biomedical databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. In 2015, it was assigned its first impact factor (4.11), which is now 2.13. During the past five years, IDP has received manuscripts from 90 countries, territories and regions across six continents with an annual acceptance rate of all contributions maintained at less than 40%. Content analysis shows that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), followed by the \u201CBig Three\u201D (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) and infectious diseases in general comprise 88% of all publications. In addition, a series of 10 thematic issues, covering 118 publications in all, was published as separate parts of the first five volumes. These publications were cited 975 times, which equals an average of 8.3 times per publication. The current challenge is to identify cutting-edge research topics and attract and to publish first-rate publications leading to increasing importance and impact of the journal in its field.

Diseases caused by emerging viruses are a major threat to global public health. In spite of greater awareness of safety and containment procedures, the handling of pathogenic viruses remains a likely source of infection, and mortality, among laboratory workers. There is a steady increase in both the number of laboratories and scientist handling emerging viruses for diagnostics and research. The potential for harm associated to work with these infectious agents can be minimized through the application of sound biosafety concepts and practices. The main factors to the prevention of laboratory-acquired infection are well-trained personnel who are knowledgable and biohazard aware, who are perceptive of the various ways of transmission, and who are professional in safe laboratory practice management. In addition, we should emphasize that appropriate facilities, practices and procedures are to be used by the laboratory workers for the handling of emerging viruses in a safe and secure manner. This review is aimed at providing researchers and laboratory personnel with basic biosafety principles to protect themselves from exposure to emerging viruses while working in the laboratory. This paper focuses on what emerging viruses are, why emerging viruses can cause laboratory-acquired infection, how to assess the risk of working with emerging viruses, and how laboratory-acquired infection can be prevented. Control measures used in the laboratory designed as such that they protect workers from emerging viruses and safeguard the public through the safe disposal of infectious wastes are also addressed.","publish_time":"2017-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Artika, I.

Therefore it is necessary to develop assays that have high diagnostic sensitivity, are broad and robust, and combine sample concentration and removal of inhibitors.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wid\u00E9n, Frederik; V\u00E5gsholm, Ivar; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Muradrasoli, Shaman","journal":"Trends in Food Science \u0026 Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6400e6a80ec8af343dc200fbce370be996a4534.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2011.05.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224411001324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288228/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224411001324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food matrices","control of food","important sources of food","detection reliable methods","new methods","decade viruses","removal of inhibitors","human disease","detection of virus","high sequence variability","high diagnostic sensitivity","composition","sample concentration","viral contamination","assays","traditional bacteriological indicators","challenge","PCR","focus","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

Methods Regulatory network is constructed to be a hopfield-like network with nodes representing biomarkers and directional connections to be regulations in between. The input to the network is the measured expression levels of biomarkers, and the output is the summation of regulatory strengths from other biomarkers. The network is optimized towards minimizing the energy function that is defined as the measure of the disagreement between the input and output of the network. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. Results Two datasets have been used as test beds, one dataset includes patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with different responses to chemotherapy drug, and the other consists of patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and control normals. The regulatory networks among protein biomarkers were reconstructed for different disease conditions in each dataset. We demonstrated our methods have better classification capability when comparing with conventional methods including Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), linear support vector machines (linSVM) and radial basis function based support vector machines (rbfSVM). Conclusion The derived networks can effectively capture the unique regulatory patterns of protein markers associated with different patient groups and hence can be used for disease classification. The discovered regulation relationships can potentially provide insights to revealing the molecular signaling pathways. In this paper, a novel technique of regulatory network is proposed on purpose of modeling biomarker regulations and classifying different disease groups. The network is composed of a certain number of nodes that are directionally connected in between in which nodes denote predictors and connections to be the regulation relationship. The network is optimized towards minimizing its energy function with biomarker expression data acquired from a specific patient group, thus the optimized network can model the regulatory relationship of biomarkers under the same circumstance. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. The regulatory network can extract unique features of each disease condition, thus one immediate application of regulatory network is to classifying different diseases. We demonstrated that regulatory network is capable of performing disease classification through comparing with conventional methods including FLD, KNN, linSVM and rbfSVM on two protein datasets. We believe our method is promising in mining knowledge of protein regulations and be powerful for disease classification.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hong Qiang; Zhu, Hai Long; Cho, William C.S.; Yip, Timothy T.C.; Ngan, Roger K.C.; Law, Stephen C.K.","journal":"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29d374c381ed152a0a2550370fa8ff2234d8533b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126395.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365709001043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962281/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365709001043; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2009.07.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Methods Regulatory network","non-linear regulatory network","optimized network","regulatory networks","immediate application of regulatory network","novel technique of regulatory network","regulatory relationship of biomarkers","regulatory relationships of protein biomarkers","disease classification","different disease groups","summation of regulatory strengths","different disease conditions","unique regulatory patterns of protein markers","different patient groups","different responses","different diseases","protein datasets","energy function","complicated regulations","conventional methods","mining knowledge of protein regulations","sigmoid kernel function","measured expression levels of biomarkers","purpose of modeling biomarker regulations","linSVM","linear support vector machines","radial basis function based support vector machines","FLD","KNN","rbfSVM","output","better classification capability","input","biomarker expression data","discovered regulation relationships","certain number of nodes","unique features","directional connections","derived networks","patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma","Fisher linear discriminant","specific patient group","patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome","influenza","insights","chemotherapy drug","nearest neighborhood","test beds","control normals","disagreement","paper","predictors","Abstract Objective","hopfield","pathways","Conclusion","circumstance","Results"],"language":"en"},

Methods In a prospective study, infants with suspected late-onset bacterial sepsis underwent viral testing alongside routine blood culture sampling. Using a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, H1N1 virus, parainfluenza virus 1 to 4, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and picornavirus. Stools were examined for adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, and enterovirus.

Studies have consistently shown inadequate health care worker (HCW) compliance with isolation precautions. Evaluating adherence through direct observation of HCW behavior is considered the \u201Cgold standard\u201D but is labor-intensive, requiring the collection and analysis of a large volume of observations. Methods Two methods of data collection to assess HCW compliance were evaluated: a manual method using a paper form (PF), with subsequent data entry into a database, and an electronic method using a Web-based form (WBF) with real-time data recording. Observations were conducted at 4 hospitals (a total of 2,065 beds) to assess the availability of gloves, gowns, and masks; isolation sign postings; and HCW isolation practices. Results A total of 13,878 isolation rooms were observed in 2009. The median number of rooms observed per day was 61 for PF and 60 for WBF, and the respective mean observation times per room were 149 seconds and 60 seconds. Thus, use of the WBF provided a time savings of 89 seconds per room. Conclusion Simple electronic forms can significantly decrease the required resources for monitoring HCW adherence to hospital policies. Use of the WBF decreased the observation time by 60%, allowing for increases in the frequency and intensity of surveillance activities.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ross, Barbara; Marine, Melissa; Chou, Mei; Cohen, Bevin; Chaudhry, Rohit; Larson, Elaine; Landers, Timothy; Behta, Maryam","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/320a6ade1347776b7726f15b3a512fb069ca9ad1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3193891.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655311001684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737176/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.01.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655311001684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PF","WBF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WBF","HCW compliance","HCW isolation practices","isolation rooms","seconds","monitoring HCW adherence","direct observation of HCW behavior","isolation precautions","methods of data collection","isolation sign postings","hospitals","electronic method","PF","total","subsequent data entry","real-time data recording","paper form","manual method","respective mean observation times","time savings","Web-based form","large volume of observations","median number of rooms","Conclusion Simple electronic forms","required resources","inadequate health care worker","key goal of infection prevention plans","transmission of resistant organisms","gowns","analysis","masks","database","hospital policies","day","gold standard","frequency","intensity of surveillance activities","availability of gloves","Background","Studies","beds"],"language":"en"},

Unlike cellular organisms with their uniform replication-expression scheme, viruses possess either RNA or DNA genomes and exploit all conceivable replication-expression strategies. Although viruses extensively exchange genes with their hosts, there exists a set of viral hallmark genes that are shared by extremely diverse groups of viruses to the exclusion of cellular life forms.

In order to control the outbreak of human-infected H7N9 cases, Guangdong launched a new policy on the central slaughtering of live poultry in 2015. This study aims to evaluate attitudes of consumers and live-poultry workers toward the policy. The live-poultry workers consisted of two sub-groups: live-poultry traders and poultry farm workers. METHODS: Consumers and live-poultry workers from Guangdong were enrolled by stratified multi-stage random sampling. Online and field surveys were conducted to investigate participants\u2019 attitudes on policy implementation. Questionnaires were developed to quantify participant demographics, to collect information about attitudes toward the policy, and to identify influential factors of policy acceptability. Proportional odds logistics regression was used in the univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 1449 consumers, 181 live-poultry traders, and 114 poultry farm workers completed the study. RESULTS: Policy acceptability percentages among consumers, live-poultry traders, and poultry farm workers were 57.1, 37.9, and 62.6%, respectively. Logistics regression shows that consumers tended not to support the policy if they were males, if they were concerned with the food safety of chilled products, and if they preferred purchasing live poultry. Live-poultry traders tended not to support if they were subsidized by the government, if they were males, if they experienced a drop in trading volume, and if they were unclear whether avian flu was a preventable disease. Finally, poultry farm workers tended not to support if they experienced a drop in trading volume, if they operated a poultry farm on a small to medium scale, and if they experienced inconvenience in their work due to the policy. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a substantial refusal or slowness to accept the policy. Failure to accept the policy results from varying reasons. Among consumers, concern about food safety and dietary preference are two major causes of disapproval. Policy acceptability among live-poultry workers diverges within the two sub-groups. While a large percentage of poultry farm workers accept the policy, the drop in trading and an insufficient subsidy hamper acceptance by live-poultry traders. We recommend that policy-makers promote health education and alleviate the policy impact on trading with a reformed subsidy policy to increase acceptability. These findings are crucial for the prevention of human-infected H7N9 cases in Guangdong.

Yet, little is known about the epidemiology of a majority of astroviruses including porcine astrovirus type 3 (PoAstV3), which is a putative cause of polioencephalomyelitis in swine. Accordingly, a cross-sectional study was conducted on sow farms with or without reported PoAstV3-associated neurologic disease in growing pigs weaned from those farms. Additionally, a conveniently selected subset of piglets from one farm was selected for gross and histologic evaluation. The distribution of PoAstV3 in the enteric system was evaluated through in situ hybridization. PoAstV3, as detected by RT-qPCR on fecal samples, was frequently detected across sows and piglets (66\u201390%) on all farms (65\u201385%). PoAstV3 was detected subsequently at a similar detection frequency (77% vs 85%) on one farm after three months. Viral shedding, as determined by the cycle quantification value, suggests that piglets shed higher quantities of virus than adult swine. No link between gastrointestinal disease and PoAstV3 was found. However, PoAstV3 was detected by in situ in myenteric plexus neurons of piglets elucidating a possible route of spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system. These data suggest PoAstV3 has endemic potential, is shed in the feces at greater quantities by suckling piglets when compared to sows, and infection is widespread on farms in which it is detected.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rawal, Gaurav; Ferreyra, Franco Matias; Macedo, Nubia R.; Bradner, Laura K.; Harmon, Karen M.; Mueller, Adam; Allison, Grant; Linhares, Daniel C.L.; Arruda, Bailey L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24f3fb94ffa06167fa87ba73f357916cc88359b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893673.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11111051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of PoAstV3","suckling piglets","selected subset of piglets","gastrointestinal disease","sow farms","Astroviruses cause disease","myenteric plexus neurons of piglets","neurologic disease","sows","higher quantities of virus","majority of astroviruses","enteric system","gastrointestinal tract","greater quantities","adult swine","situ hybridization","central nervous system","putative cause of polioencephalomyelitis","feces","porcine astrovirus type","possible route","growing pigs","vs","cycle quantification value","fecal samples","RT-qPCR","endemic potential","variety of species","similar detection frequency","cross-sectional study","data","infection","link","histologic evaluation","epidemiology","Viral shedding","months"],"language":"en"},

The thermal process was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The evolution of physicochemical characteristics of PCMs was studied. The photothermal conversion and solar steam generation performances of the optimal sample (PCM(Fe/600)) were evaluated. The adsorption properties of PCM(Fe/600) for methylene blue (MB) were investigated. Results showed that Fe(3\u002B) promoted the breaking of cellulose chains in WCCB, leading to the occurrence of pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures and the reduction of activation energy by 76.63 kJ mol(\u22121). Char yield raised because volatile radicals were captured by FeCl(3)-derived amorphous Fe(III) species, then involved in char formation. Amorphous Fe(III) continuously converted into Fe(3)O(4) crystallites with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 700 \u00B0C, then \u03B1-Fe was formed at 800 \u00B0C via the carbothermal reduction of Fe(3)O(4). FeCl(3) was favorable to the formation of a developed microporous structure. Surface area significantly increased with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600 \u00B0C due to the removal of volatiles. The etching of carbon by Fe(3)O(4) above 700 \u00B0C also led to the increase of surface area. PCM(Fe/600) exhibited higher optical absorption than other samples due to its high graphite degree and porosity. It also had excellent photothermal performance; thus, solar steam yield was 1.46 times that of the pure water with the assistance of PCM(Fe/600). PCM(Fe/600) in floating state was effective in adsorption of MB from water. Besides, the adsorption behavior fitted Langmuir model with a monolayer adsorption capacity reached up to 70.9 mg g(\u22121).","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Yuhui; Cao, Junrui","journal":"Biomass Convers Biorefin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3084760aa1fe9776427268b37c86d0ab62aa6e7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7209767.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-00739-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WCCB","PCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1-Fe","carbothermal reduction of Fe","derived amorphous Fe","adsorption properties of PCM","WCCB","adsorption of MB","assistance of PCM","FeCl","adsorption behavior","solar steam yield","monolayer adsorption capacity","Char yield","char formation","carbonization temperature","increase of surface area","solar steam generation performances","photothermal conversion","pure water","etching of carbon","thermal process","thermal treatment","reduction of activation energy","excellent photothermal performance","Porous carbon monoliths","evolution of physicochemical characteristics of PCMs","optimal sample","samples","lower temperatures","Langmuir model","slurrying","times","species","floating state","Fourier","high graphite degree","thermogravimetric analyzer","cardboard box","occurrence of pyrolysis","solution","waste","volatile radicals","higher optical absorption","kJ mol","developed microporous structure","porosity","breaking of cellulose chains","crystallites","methylene blue","infrared spectrometer","removal of volatiles","Results"],"language":"en"},

This leads to reduced secretion and/or infectivity of virions and hence lower viral titres, both in vitro and in vivo. Free oligosaccharide analysis from iminosugar-treated cells shows that antiviral activity correlates with production of mono- and tri-glucosylated sugars, indicative of inhibition of ER \u03B1-glucosidases. We demonstrate that glucose-mimicking iminosugars inhibit isolated glycoprotein and glycolipid processing enzymes and that this inhibition also occurs in primary cells treated with these drugs. Galactose-mimicking iminosugars that have been tested do not inhibit glycoprotein processing but do inhibit glycolipid processing, and are not antiviral against DENV. By comparison, the antiviral activity of glucose-mimetic iminosugars that inhibit endoplasmic reticulum-resident \u03B1-glucosidases, but not glycolipid processing, demonstrates that inhibition of \u03B1-glucosidases is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against DENV. This monograph will review the investigations of many researchers into the mechanisms of action of iminosugars and the contribution of our current understanding of these mechanisms for optimising clinical delivery of iminosugars. The effects of iminosugars on enzymes other than glucosidases, the induction of ER stress and viral receptors will be also put into context. Data suggest that inhibition of \u03B1-glucosidases results in inhibited release of virus and is the primary antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against DENV.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Joanna L.; Tyrrell, Beatrice E.; Zitzmann, Nicole","journal":"Dengue and Zika: Control and Antiviral Treatment Strategies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bbe9e4e2d4de9929340530674f08fd7df8eef36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121742.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of \u03B1","mimetic iminosugars","effects of iminosugars","ER \u03B1-glucosidases","DENV","iminosugar antiviral activity","antiviral activity of glucose","antiviral activity correlates","glycolipid processing enzymes","clinical delivery of iminosugars","primary antiviral mechanism of action","endoplasmic reticulum-resident \u03B1-glucosidases","indicative of inhibition","glucosidases results","glycoprotein processing","inhibition of host endoplasmic reticulum-resident \u03B1-glucosidase enzymes","mechanisms of action","dengue virus","iminosugar-treated cells","primary cells","viral receptors","inhibited release of virus","hepatitis C virus","lower viral titres","isolated glycoprotein","misfolding of viral N-linked glycoproteins","induction of ER stress","HIV","production of mono","tri-glucosylated sugars","enveloped viruses","infectivity of virions","influenza","Free oligosaccharide analysis","current understanding","contribution","investigations","researchers","comparison","reduced secretion","drugs","Data","monograph","context","Galactose"],"language":"en"},

These results indicate that this lectin would be useful as a novel antiviral reagent for the prevention of infection.","publish_time":"2011-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Yuichiro; Morimoto, Kinjiro; Hirayama, Makoto; Hori, Kanji","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b075d4d80c09bc3e32a32bb14fabf5a63393bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092952.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X11000507; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X11000507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-influenza virus activity of KAA","antiviral activity of KAA","anti-influenza antibody","red algal lectin KAA","anti-carcinogenic activity","various strains","anti-HIV","evidence of direct binding of KAA","inhibited infection of various influenza strains","hybrid type","complex type","high mannose type N-glycans","virus entry","various biological activities","prevention of infection","novel antiviral reagent","carbohydrate binding profile","pentasaccharide core of N","similar manner","centrifugal ultrafiltration","recent pandemic H1N1","Eucheuma serra agglutinin","EC50s of low nanomolar levels","HPLC method","D2 arm","interference","Kappaphycus alvarezii","viral envelope protein","pyridylaminated oligosaccharides","hemagglutinin","ESA","exposed \u03B11","host cells","Immunofluorescence microscopy","preference","ELISA assay","mechanism","results"],"language":"en"},

We employed a whole-genome segmented amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to profile DENV-3 intrahost diversity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples from 77 dengue patients. DENV-3 intrahost diversity appears to be driven by immune pressures as well as replicative success in PBMCs and potentially other replication sites. Hotspots for intrahost variation were detected in 59\u201378% of patients in the viral Envelope and pre-Membrane/Membrane proteins, which together form the virion surface. Dominant variants at the hotspots arose via convergent microevolution, appear to be immune-escape variants, and were evolutionarily constrained at the macro-level due to viral replication defects.

Study design A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. Conclusions NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le Bourgeois, Muriel; Ferroni, Agn\u00E8s; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Varon, Emmanuelle; Thumerelle, Caroline; Br\u00E9mont, Fran\u00E7ois; Fayon, Michael J.; Delacourt, Christophe; Ligier, Caroline; Watier, Laurence; Guillemot, Didier; de Blic, Jacques; Deschildre, Antoine; Lemanac\u0027h, Ga\u00EBlle; Bui, St\u00E9phanie; Marguet, Christophe; Lubrano, Marc; Labb\u00E9, Andr\u00E9; Petit, Isabelle; Faye, Albert; Lorrot, Mathie; Mahdi, Fouad; Dubus, Jean-Christophe; Bosdure, Emmanuelle; Pin, Isabelle; Llerena, Cathy; Derelle, Jocelyne; Schweitzer, Cyril; Epaud, Ralph; Nathan, Nadia; Reix, Philippe; Wanin, St\u00E9phanie; David, Val\u00E9rie; de Pontbriand, Ulrika; Brouard, Jacques; Bessi\u00E8re, Aude; Douay, Caroline; Dupont, Claire; Petit, Claire; Richard, Jean-Romain; Toneatti, Christine; Vibet, Marie-Anne","journal":"The Journal of Pediatrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69eb6f3994e9038a39895bc685be0d3aac1c2746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094675.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347616302335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.05.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339249/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347616302335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute viral infections","increased risk of empyema","acute viral infection onset","risk factors of empyema","decreased risk","NSAIDs interaction","Conclusions NSAIDs use","day of NSAIDs exposure","antibiotic intake","consecutive days of antibiotic use","presence of antibiotic","source population of children","Cases","aOR","controls","use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","preceding days","case-control study","hours","multivariable analysis","years of age","line antipyretic treatment","hypothesized association","antibiotics","empyemas","viruses","centers","Results","Objective","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: To this end, three bat species (Eidolon helvum, Carollia perspicillata and Tadarida brasiliensis) of lung epithelial cells were separately infected with two avian and two human influenza viruses to determine their relative host innate immune resistance to infection. RESULTS: All three species of bat cells were more resistant than positive control Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to all four influenza viruses. TB1-Lu cells lacked sialic acid \u03B12,6-Gal receptors and were most resistant among the three bat species. Interestingly, avian viruses were relatively more replication permissive in all three bat species of cells than with the use of human viruses which suggest that bats could potentially play a role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses. Chemical inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway in bat cells had no effect on virus production suggesting that type I interferon signalling is not a major factor in resisting influenza virus infection. CONCLUSION: Although all three species of bat cells are relatively more resistant to influenza virus infection than control MDCK cells, they are more permissive to avian than human viruses which suggest that bats could have a contributory role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slater, Tessa; Eckerle, Isabella; Chang, Kin-Chow","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78233b5cc660bff6f716fa6cbb967775bf5c7417.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5894234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29636078/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-0979-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian viruses","species of bat cells","bat species of cells","human influenza viruses","ecology of avian influenza viruses","use of human viruses","control MDCK cells","resisting influenza virus infection","lung epithelial cells","TB1-Lu cells","species of free ranging bats","extent bats","H18N11 influenza viral RNA","high frequency of avian H9 seroconversion","virus production","replication permissive","contributory role","positive control Madin-Darby canine kidney","report","Tadarida brasiliensis","Carollia perspicillata","Eidolon helvum","major factor","important issue","sialic acid \u03B12","recent discovery of novel H17N10","relative host","address","JAK-STAT pathway","effect","interferon signalling","type","Gal receptors","immune resistance","end","Chemical inhibition","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHOD","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Three mixing ventilation methods, which are widely used in current bus configurations, and an alternative displacement ventilation method were numerically assessed in terms of their ability to limit the risk of airborne influenza infection. Furthermore, both the non air-recirculation and air-recirculation with filtration ventilation modes were investigated in terms of the influenza infection probability. According to the simulation results, air-recirculation mode with high efficiency filtration was found to cause almost the same infection risk as non air-recirculation mode (100% outdoor air supply), which indicated a potential benefit of filtration in reducing the infection risk. Additionally, for the commonly used mixing ventilation methods, air distribution method, location of return/exhaust opening and seat arrangement affected the airborne transmission of influenza between passengers. The displacement ventilation method was found to be more effective in limiting the risk of airborne infection. Overall, the developed numerical model can provide insights into how the micro-environmental conditions affect airborne infection transmission in buses. This numerical model can assist in developing effective control strategies related to airborne transmitted diseases for other frequently used public transportation systems, such as trains and airplanes.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shengwei; Srebric, Jelena; Spengler, John D.; Demokritou, Philip","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/952f14afe7014888fda5c14c2c0c654356c6c09e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117043.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311001429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288019/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132311001429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of airborne infection","infection risk","risk of airborne influenza infection","airborne infection transmission","air-recirculation mode","airborne transmission of influenza","influenza infection probability","air distribution method","filtration ventilation modes","mixing ventilation methods","alternative displacement ventilation method","airborne transmitted diseases","outdoor air supply","developed numerical model","terms","public transportation systems","high efficiency filtration","potential benefit of filtration","popular means of public transportation","bus microenvironment","effective control strategies","current bus configurations","location of return","micro-environmental conditions","insights","seat arrangement","exhaust","trains","Wells","simulation results","buses","Riley equation","passengers","airplanes","CFD"],"language":"en"},

In cats, infections with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are common. Several non-feline coronaviruses have been reported to infect feline cells as well as cats after experimental infection, supported by their ability to engage the feline receptor ortholog for cell entry. However, whether cats might become naturally infected with CoVs of other species is unknown. We analyzed coronavirus infections in cats by serological monitoring. In total 137 cat serum samples and 25 FCoV type 1 or type 2-specific antisera were screened for the presence of antibodies against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the CoV spike protein, which is immunogenic and possesses low amino acid sequence identity among coronavirus species. Seventy-eight sera were positive for antibodies that recognized one or more coronavirus S1s whereas 1 serum exclusively reacted with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and two sera exclusively reacted with porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). We observed antigenic cross-reactivity between S1s of type 1 and type 2 FCoVs, and between FCoV type 1 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Domain mapping of antibody epitopes indicated the presence of conserved epitope(s) particularly in the CD domains of S1. The cross-reactivity of FCoV type 1 and PEDV was also observed at the level of virus neutralization. To conclude, we provide the first evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity among S1 proteins of coronaviruses, which should be considered in the development of serological diagnoses. In addition, the potential role of cats in cross-species transmission of coronaviruses cannot be excluded.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shan; Li, Wentao; Schuurman, Nancy; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Egberink, Herman","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cbde00704ec55e2d030ca4f8ecb73da6ba959ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723642.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV type","coronavirus species","S1s of type","cross-species transmission of coronaviruses","coronavirus infections","coronavirus S1s","non-feline coronaviruses","human coronavirus","S1 proteins of coronaviruses","evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity","porcine delta coronavirus","potential role of cats","feline cells","feline receptor ortholog","presence of antibodies","PEDV","FCoVs","S1 receptor binding subunit","CD domains of S1","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","serological monitoring","presence of conserved epitope","cat serum samples","level of virus neutralization","development of serological diagnoses","low amino acid sequence identity","CoV spike protein","ability","Domain mapping of antibody epitopes","cell entry","HCoV","experimental infection","specific antisera","mammals","birds","PDCoV","addition"],"language":"en"},

To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences. RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection. In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection. These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected. To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations. Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants. The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes. These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection. The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.","publish_time":"1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adami, Cecilia; Pooley, Joan; Glomb, Juliet; Stecker, Eric; Fazal, Fabeha; Fleming, John O.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285712652; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285712652","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral sequences","chronic infection","RNA sequences","chronic demyelinating infection","viral replication","persistent infection","nucleocapsid sequences","variety of mutant forms of viral RNA","evolution of coronavirus RNA","Abstract Coronavirus infection of mice","mutations","results","viral structural genes","pathogenesis of chronic demyelination","deletion variant viral RNAs","spike gene","deletion mutants","nucleocapsid gene","role of persistent viral genetic information","infectious virus particles","RT-PCR products","point mutants","termination mutants","nucleocapsid regions","genetic changes","days postinfection","cloned products","intracerebrally inoculated mice","brain homongenates","central nervous system of mice","amino acid changes","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods","quasispecies","study of acute encephalitis","CNS","diverse population","times","model","contrast","implications","Sequencing","host"],"language":"en"},

Its impact on the environment is heavily debated, particularly in relation to climate forcing attributed to emissions at cruising altitudes and the noise and the deterioration of air quality at ground-level due to airport operations. This latter environmental issue is of particular interest to the scientific community and policymakers, especially in relation to the breach of limit and target values for many air pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, near the busiest airports and the resulting consequences for public health. Despite the increased attention given to aircraft emissions at ground-level and air pollution in the vicinity of airports, many research gaps remain. Sources relevant to air quality include not only engine exhaust and non-exhaust emissions from aircraft, but also emissions from the units providing power to the aircraft on the ground, the traffic due to the airport ground service, maintenance work, heating facilities, fugitive vapours from refuelling operations, kitchens and restaurants for passengers and operators, intermodal transportation systems, and road traffic for transporting people and goods in and out to the airport. Many of these sources have received inadequate attention, despite their high potential for impact on air quality. This review aims to summarise the state-of-the-art research on aircraft and airport emissions and attempts to synthesise the results of studies that have addressed this issue. It also aims to describe the key characteristics of pollution, the impacts upon global and local air quality and to address the future potential of research by highlighting research needs.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masiol, Mauro; Harrison, Roy M.","journal":"Atmospheric Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6525a96d803e7e9f3c33171c1e2b12dd8752411c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108289.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.05.070; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231014004361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231014004361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aircraft emissions","airport emissions","air pollution","deterioration of air quality","local air quality","air pollutants","ground-level","airport ground service","airport operations","non-exhaust emissions","state-of-the-art research","research gaps","research needs","future potential of research","relation","engine exhaust","refuelling operations","road traffic","vicinity of airports","high potential","busiest airports","inadequate attention","increased attention","Sources relevant","environmental issue","key characteristics of pollution","heating facilities","fugitive vapours","maintenance work","passengers","kitchens","impacts","intermodal transportation systems","operators","restaurants","noise","particulate matter","resulting consequences","cruising altitudes","target values","nitrogen oxides","breach of limit","climate forcing","goods","power","scientific community","public health","Abstract Civil aviation","policymakers","people","units","developing economies","globalisation","results of studies","review","year"],"language":"en"},

Further modifications of the hydroxy group at the C1 position with retention of a ketone at the C2 position could potentially lead to inhibitors with improved overall properties.","publish_time":"2014-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Peng; Li, Lin\u2010Feng; Wang, Qing\u2010Yin; Shang, Lu\u2010Qing; Shi, Pei\u2010Yong; Yin, Zheng","journal":"ChemMedChem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a980f71cc6c67df1c21281f2aa4acdcb4efd2aa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9949e82f2046f3b501aa3325d7156d833a5e8659.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162318.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.201300505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCm","lycorine analogues","potent anti\u2010DENV activity","activity relationships","series of novel lycorine derivatives","oxolycorine","activity relationship model","excellent antiviral activities","inhibition of dengue virus","C1 position","C2 position","low cytotoxicity","reduced cytotoxicity","three\u2010dimensional quantitative structure","order","field analysis protocol","inhibitors","retention","acetyllycorine","hydroxy group","humans","specific therapeutics","systemic viral infection","cell cultures","improved overall properties","vaccines","study","natural plant alkaloid","experimental results","Aedes mosquitoes","modifications","selectivity index","flaviviruses","ketones"],"language":"en"},

In our study, stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting season 2014\u20132015 (from October to January) were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of tested samples. Nucleotide analysis of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, and G5P[13]I5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to porcine and human RVAs. The prevalence of RVC in wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9%, and EV-G in 2.5% of samples. During our study no PRRSV or coronaviruses were detected. Our study provides the first evidence of RVC prevalence in wild boars and indicates that wild boars might contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses.","publish_time":"2016-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moutel\u00EDkov\u00E1, Romana; Dufkov\u00E1, Lucie; Kamler, Ji\u0159\u00ED; Drimaj, Jakub; Plhal, Radim; Prod\u011Blalov\u00E1, Jana","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d428c833299e8f39140505fbff407a5ff5bbdc32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117292.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516302085; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516302085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27599927/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.08.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTV","PSV","RVA"],"locations":["Europe","Czech Republic"],"keyphrases":["wild boars","wild boar population","study","population of free-living wild boar","Abstract Population of wild boar","prevalence of RVC","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus","porcine respiratory coronavirus","RVA strains","EV-G","respiratory syndrome virus","evidence of RVC prevalence","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","I5 genotypes","PRRSV","G4P","enterovirus G","genetic variability of RVA","PTV","PSV","stool samples","tested samples","prevalence of enteric viral pathogens","close relation","domestic animals","phylogenetic analysis","enteric viruses","human habitats","human RVAs","Nucleotide analysis of VP7","TGEV","PRCV","PEDV","Czech Republic","members of family Coronaviridae","rotavirus groups","PHEV","humans","possibility of natural transmission","VP4","VP6 genes","Picornaviridae","teschovirus","sapelovirus","important reservoir","G5P","I1","Europe","G11P","hunting season","coronaviruses","RT-PCR","aim"],"language":"en"},

Several viral and cell proteins including spike, membrane, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), dynein heavy chain, fatty acid synthase and transmembrane protein 43 bound E protein. In the present work, we focused on the binding of E protein to nsp3 in infected cells and cell-free systems. This interaction was mediated by the N-terminal acidic domain of nsp3. Moreover, nsp3 and E protein colocalized during the infection. It was shown that E protein was ubiquitinated in vitro and in cell culture, suggesting that the interaction between nsp3 and E protein may play a role in the E protein ubiquitination status and therefore on its turnover.","publish_time":"2010-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1lvarez, Enrique; DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jim\u00E9nez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Marcos-Villar, Laura; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f9586489f9f9484576408f27e0dd24712eb446a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119183.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210001790; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20409569/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210001790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bound E protein","binding of E protein","CoV E","transmembrane protein","non-structural protein","E protein ubiquitination status","SARS-CoV","cell proteins","complexes of SARS","cell culture","interaction","N-terminal acidic domain of nsp3","cell-free systems","fatty acid synthase","infected cells","dynein heavy chain","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","spike","role","envelope","tandem affinity purification system","tags","turnover","infection","present work"],"language":"en"},

This study describes the current epidemiological status of MERS-CoV in the world. METHODS: Epidemiological analysis was performed on data derived from all MERS-CoV cases recorded in the disease outbreak news on WHO website between 1.1.2017 and 17.1.2018. Demographic and clinical information as well as potential contacts and probable risk factors for mortality were extracted based on laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. RESULTS: A total of 229 MERS-CoV cases, including 70 deaths (30.5%), were recorded in the disease outbreak news on world health organization website over the study period. Based on available details in this study, the case fatality rate in both genders was 30.5% (70/229) [32.1% (55/171) for males and 25.8% (15/58) for females]. The disease occurrence was higher among men [171 cases (74.7%)] than women [58 cases (25.3%)]. Variables such as comorbidities and exposure to MERS-CoV cases were significantly associated with mortality in people affected with MERS-CoV infections, and adjusted odds ratio estimates were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.16, 7.03) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.35, 8.20), respectively. All age groups had an equal chance of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In today\u2019s \u201Cglobal village\u201D, there is probability of MERS-CoV epidemic at any time and in any place without prior notice. Thus, health systems in all countries should implement better triage systems for potentially imported cases of MERS-CoV to prevent large epidemics.","publish_time":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mobaraki, Kazhal; Ahmadzadeh, Jamal","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5187f0f3f45b0a1882a44001d193a24c97b0bb1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6487021.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029095/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3987-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV cases","MERS-CoV infections","imported cases of MERS","CoV epidemic","probability of MERS","current epidemiological status of MERS","health systems","disease outbreak news","world health organization website","global health security","study period","disease occurrence","CI","equal chance of mortality","global village","Epidemiological analysis","new viral epidemic","better triage systems","emergent threat","potential contacts","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","adjusted odds ratio estimates","BACKGROUND","probable risk factors","countries","time","exposure","case fatality rate","clinical information","comorbidities","data","people","total","laboratory","age groups","place","genders","CONCLUSIONS","today\u2019s","large epidemics","prior notice","available details","Variables","METHODS","RESULTS","deaths","women","females"],"language":"en"},

The urinary antigen is a most effective rapid test that has allowed targeted therapy for Legionnaire disease at the point of care. The high specificity (\u003E 90%) allows the clinician to administer appropriate anti-Legionella therapy based on a single rapid test; however, its low sensitivity (76%) means that a notable number of cases of Legionnaire disease will go undiagnosed if other tests, especially culture, are not performed. Further, culture for Legionella is not readily available. If a culture is not performed, epidemiologic identification of the source of the bacterium cannot be ascertained by molecular fingerprinting of the patient and the putative source strain. We recommend resurrection of the basic principles of infectious disease, which are to identify the microbial etiology of the infection and to use narrow, targeted antimicrobial therapy. To reduce antimicrobial overuse with subsequent antimicrobial resistance, these basic principles must be applied in concert with traditional and newer tests in the clinical microbiology laboratory.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Victor L.; Stout, Janet E.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99a8275966a6431128927e8c450efa7db8c706b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130296.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369209607443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995763/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209607443; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.09-0939","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":["Legionnaire"],"keyphrases":["culture","targeted antimicrobial therapy","targeted therapy","Legionnaire disease","based microbiology","CAP","basic principles of infectious disease","antimicrobial overuse","clinical microbiology laboratory","point of care","appropriate anti-Legionella therapy","effective rapid test","single rapid test","subsequent antimicrobial resistance","newer tests","molecular fingerprinting","advent of molecular","microbial etiology","widespread empiric use","putative source strain","pneumonia","patient","concert","spiraling empiricism","golden era","notable number of cases","management of community","bacterium","infection","clinician","causative pathogen","development of broad-spectrum antibiotics","urinary antigen","epidemiologic identification","resurrection","nonsynchronous events","low sensitivity","approach clashes","infecting microbe","high specificity"],"language":"en"},

The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. \u201CAll-in/all-out\u201D operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ennaji, Youssef; Khataby, Khadija; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0de24c5fdb4a0e77b1b5e8c002ced81ebe9b227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150180.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149669000032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149669000032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus difficult","new virus strains","RNA virus","prevailing IBV strains","identification of IBV types","large number of virus isolates","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","causative agent IBV","Genetic typing of IBV","new types","conventional vaccines","new generation vaccines","diagnosis of IB","backbone of IB control program","chickens","advancement of molecular methods","molecular diagnostic methods","reproductive tract","recombination events","contagious disease","upper respiratory tract","live vaccine viruses","sequence analysis","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification","oil emulsified","S1 glycoprotein gene","good biosafety measures","great ability","basis of prevention","reversion of virulence","substantial economic losses","vaccination","viral genome","poultry industry","short period of time","relatedness","recombinant","vector","mutations","factors","operations of rearing","D274","Surveillance","coronavirus","addition","variant serotypes","pursuit","Massachusetts","QX","nephritis"],"language":"en"},

Methods We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first. Results We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41\u201357%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091\u20130.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4\u201312). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35\u20131.8).

In this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores: a badger (Meles meles), a mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and an otter (Lutra lutra) from Portugal. RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses. Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger. In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease. Our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut, although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution.","publish_time":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Zeller, Mark; Heylen, Elisabeth; Lefr\u00E8re, Hanne; Mesquita, Jo\u00E3o Rodrigo; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/609c3b3465c19726b4777d17e3e2b19ca9de990b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4459443.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986582/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0305-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["novel viruses","fecal material","fecal associated viruses","presence of novel","divergent viruses","putative novel member","viral populations","Meles meles","viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples","knowledge of viral species present","Lutra lutra","otter","mongoose","study","badger","RESULTS","gemycircularviruses","healthy carnivores","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene","true host species","Nodaviridae family","wild animals","interpretation","gut","Herpestes ichneumon","BACKGROUND","Portugal","risk of zoonotic diseases","order","great caution","CONCLUSIONS","addition"],"language":"en"},

The classically and alternatively activated (M1 and M2, respectively) macrophage phenotypes are defined by the specific molecular characteristics induced in response to prototypic pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. In this study, we used LPS/IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 to stimulate porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro and investigated the expression changes of several novel markers during macrophage polarization. Notably, we found that LPS/IFN-\u03B3-stimulated PAMs express prototypical M1 molecules, whereas IL-4-stimulated PAMs express M2 molecules. We also demonstrated that replication of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain HuN4 was effectively suppressed in LPS/IFN-\u03B3-stimulated M1 PAMs (M1 type), but not IL-4 stimulated M2 PAMs. However, this was not observed with the classic, less pathogenic CH-1a strain. Moreover, we found that M2 marker expression gradually increased after PAM infection with PRRSV, whereas no significant changes were found with M1 marker expression, suggesting that PRRSV infection may skew macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype. Finally, we found that anti-viral cytokine expression was significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages or nonpolarized controls. In summary, our results show that PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs, which may serve as a foundation for further understanding of the dynamic phenotypic changes during macrophage polarization and their effects on viral infection.","publish_time":"2017-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"WANG, Longtao; HU, Shouping; LIU, Qiang; LI, Yiru; XU, Lu; ZHANG, Zhuo; CAI, Xuehui; HE, Xijun","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08079db5747d09016612f319e154ff81c4d9aef5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5709573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28924090/; https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.17-0258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stimulated M1 PAMs","M1 macrophages","stimulated M2 PAMs","M2 macrophages","Macrophage polarization","M1 marker expression","M1 type","M2 marker expression","stimulated PAMs express M2 molecules","PRRSV infection","expression changes","M2 phenotype","prototypical M1 molecules","PRRSV replication","IFN-\u03B3","macrophage phenotypes","LPS","viral infection","porcine alveolar macrophages","response","significant changes","dynamic phenotypic changes","anti-viral cytokine expression","PAM infection","strain HuN4","pathogenic CH","respiratory syndrome virus","functional profile","specific molecular characteristics","novel markers","effects","anti-inflammatory cues","microenvironmental signals","process","nonpolarized controls","results","classic","summary","study","foundation"],"language":"en"},

Paracetamol is as an analgesic and antipyretic; chlorphenamine is an antihistamine; and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor and decongestant. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and flu-like syndrome in adults. METHODS: This study enrolled 146 individuals aged 18 to 60 years who had moderate to severe flu-like syndrome or common cold. After clinical examination and laboratory tests, individuals were randomly assigned to receive the fixed-dose combination (73) or placebo (73), five capsules per day for 48 to 72 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of the scores of 10 symptoms on a four-point Likert-type scale. To evaluate treatment safety, the occurrence of adverse events was also measured. RESULTS: Mean age was 33.5 (\u00B19.5) years in the placebo group and 33.8 (\u00B111.5) in the treatment group. There were 55 women and 18 men in the placebo group, and 46 women and 27 men in the treatment group. Comparison of overall symptom scores in the two groups revealed a significantly greater reduction in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p = 0.015). Analysis at the first 13 dose intervals (\u00B1 66 h of treatment) showed a greater reduction of symptom scores in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p \u003C 0.05). The number and distribution of adverse events were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: A fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine was safe and more effective than placebo in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold or flu-like syndrome in adults.

A custom test setup was designed, manufactured and used in 8 bone sawing experiments, using a particle counter to determine the production of aerosol particles while varying the 5 chosen parameters. The number of counted particles was highest with higher saw blade frequencies, lower saw blade contact loads, in dry completely skeletonized bone compared to fresh bone, and using an electrical oscillating saw compared to hand-sawing. Under all conditions, the high amount of aerosol counted posed potential health risks. The ventilation system that we tested was adequate in removing the produced particles, but these high-tech systems are not always available in developing countries or emergency situations. The production of aerosols can be reduced by optimizing the sawing parameters.

The SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates membrane fusion events during virus entry and virus-induced cell-to-cell fusion. To delineate functional domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, single point mutations, cluster-to-lysine and cluster-to-alanine mutations, as well as carboxyl-terminal truncations were investigated in transient expression experiments. Mutagenesis of either the coiled-coil domain of the S glycoprotein amino terminal heptad repeat, the predicted fusion peptide, or an adjacent but distinct region, severely compromised S-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, while intracellular transport and cell-surface expression were not adversely affected. Surprisingly, a carboxyl-terminal truncation of 17 amino acids substantially increased S glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion suggesting that the terminal 17 amino acids regulated the S fusogenic properties. In contrast, truncation of 26 or 39 amino acids eliminating either one or both of the two endodomain cysteine-rich motifs, respectively, inhibited cell fusion in comparison to the wild-type S. The 17 and 26 amino-acid deletions did not adversely affect S cell-surface expression, while the 39 amino-acid truncation inhibited S cell-surface expression suggesting that the membrane proximal cysteine-rich motif plays an essential role in S cell-surface expression. Mutagenesis of the acidic amino-acid cluster in the carboxyl terminus of the S glycoprotein as well as modification of a predicted phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster revealed that this amino-acid motif may play a functional role in the retention of S at cell surfaces. This genetic analysis reveals that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains extracellular domains that regulate cell fusion as well as distinct endodomains that function in intracellular transport, cell-surface expression, and cell fusion.","publish_time":"2005-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petit, Chad M.; Melancon, Jeffrey M.; Chouljenko, Vladimir N.; Colgrove, Robin; Farzan, Michael; Knipe, David M.; Kousoulas, K.

Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients. Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself. The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Mancia, Giuseppe; Dell\u2019Oro, Raffaella; Grassi, Guido","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f366229ee963f4e585acb6512f7c2e9286412696.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217779.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820312147?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104906; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820312147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prognosis of COVID","CVD","prevalence of hypertension","higher susceptibility of patients","uncontrolled hypertension","role of hypertension","significant prevalence of arterial hypertension","adverse outcome","lethal outcome","RAAS inhibitors","coronavirus disease","comorbidities","effect of treatment","novel coronavirus","infection of coronavirus","underlying disease","Recent data","cardiac function deterioration","renal function impairment","cardiovascular diseases","aldosterone system","adjustment","progression","renin-angiotensin","independent predictors","demographic parameters","association","review article","disadvantages","uncertain benefits","relationship","questions","baseline","influence","short period of time","small population","results","world","aim","evaluation","complications","investigations"],"language":"en"},

After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation.

Moreover, lung cells that have ACE2 expression may be the main target cells during 2019-nCoV infection. However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems. Through scRNA-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection.

Specific antibodies to M. haemolytica, BRSV and PI3V and mean values of IgA, IgG concentrations were significantly higher in the experimental calves compared with the controls. However, specific antibody titres to adenovirus type 3, BHV1 and BVDV in the experimental calves had constant levels while the control group levels changed. The IgM, Hp and SAA concentrations generally increased until week 8 in the experimental group, but the control group titres became higher after week 9. This study demonstrates that specific immunisation of cows pre-partum significantly stimulated parameters associated with immunity and it also controlled the acute phase response intensity in their offspring. Therefore the vaccination of dams may provide additional antibody protection against infection to their offspring.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dudek, Katarzyna; Bednarek, Dariusz; Ayling, Roger D.; Szacawa, Ewelina","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/804295e0173e403f91824b8f8a1886aa4c67fb32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126404.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881400112X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815344/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881400112X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental group","experimental calves","offspring","control group titres","control group levels","specific antibody titres","BRSV","newborn calves","Specific antibodies","specific immunisation of cows pre-partum","PI3V infections","Mannheimia haemolytica","constant levels","IgG concentrations","SAA concentrations","vaccination of dams","additional antibody protection","effect of vaccinating pregnant cows","inactivated vaccine","mean values of IgA","BVDV","adenovirus type","BHV1","selected immune responses","stimulated parameters","acute phase response intensity","immunity","weeks","IgM","Hp","study","Blood samples","controls"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to investigate the existence of enteric viruses in two Egyptian farms with a history of recurrent diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected from 25 diarrheic calves. RNA was extracted and tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, torovirus, coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Overall, 76 % (19/25) of samples tested positive for one or more viruses. Rota-, noro- and astroviruses were detected in 48 %, 24 % and 32 % of tested samples, respectively. About 37 % (7/19) of positive samples had two different viruses. One-month-old calves were the group most vulnerable to infections. Based on phylogenetic analysis, bovine rotaviruses were of genotypes G6 and G10, bovine noroviruses were in GIII.2, and bovine astroviruses were in the BAstV lineage 1. Astrovirus sequences showed a high level nucleotide sequence similarity with the Brazilian BAstV sequences available in GenBank. We believe this is the first report of bovine norovirus and bovine astrovirus circulating among calves in Egypt. Further epidemiological studies are recommended to investigate their presence on a wider scale, to predict their association with NCD, and to design appropriate diagnostic and control methods.

Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation. Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against COVID-19. The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (\u201CSpanish flu\u201D 1918, \u201CAsian flu\u201D 1956 and \u201Cthe Hong Kong flu\u201D 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines. The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4\u002B memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response. According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4\u002B memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting \u201Clung crash\u201D until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the COVID-19 will occur.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ietto, Giuseppe","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db45f2007d78df7576da75c82b8b5068479cf47f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175879.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109779; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720304242?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720304242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["immune system readier","rate of transmission","coronaviruses","distribution of mortality rate","virus specific immunity","scattered immunity","significative higher mortality rate","distribution of death rate","severe clinical presentation","diphtheria toxoids","CD4","development of respiratory severe illness","Spanish flu","community","severe lung injury","Asian flu","age groups","contact","novel coronavirus COVID","hypothesis vaccine formulations","Hong Kong flu","Bordetella pertussis","transmission route","virus responsible","memory T cell recall","faster spread","memory exploiting","lung crash","younger people","introduction of vaccines","immunological support","non-self antigens","use of oncolytic vaccines","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","full-blown ARDS","worldwide outbreak","tetanus","order","transit","historical pandemics","inactivated bacteria","ability of past vaccinations","ongoing anti-tumour response","recent studies","phenomenon","malignancies","immunotherapy","infected patients","infection","Possible explanation","Children","fact","administration"],"language":"en"},

Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern. This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent. In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe. As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.

As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. RESULTS: In this study we highlighted the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (\u224819 kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, \u22482 kb long) gene. We have quantified changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compared these to theoretical expectations.

In response to the international threat of WPV transmission and changes in the national vaccination policy, we established an environmental surveillance system to monitor the circulation of wild and vaccine-related poliovirus in Taiwan. From July 2012 to December 2013, we collected sewage specimens every month from 10 sewage treatment plants located throughout Taiwan. The specimens were concentrated by the two-phase separation method and then inoculated into L20B, RD, and A549 cells for virus isolation. Viral isolates were identified and serotyped by immunofluorescence assay or molecular analysis. A total of 300 sewage samples were collected, and the results showed 163 samples (54.3%) were positive for virus, and 268 isolates were identified. Among these, 75 samples (25%) were positive for enterovirus (EV), but no poliovirus was found. In addition, 92 isolates were identified as enteroviruses and the most common serotypes were coxsackievirus B4, coxsackievirus B3, and coxsackievirus B2. Interestingly, 102 (34%) and 82 (27.3%) specimens were positive for mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) and adenovirus, respectively. This study confirmed that sewage surveillance can be a useful additional modality for monitoring the possible presence of wild-type or vaccine-derived poliovirus in wastewater, and can indicate the current types of viruses circulating in the population. Furthermore, since MRV was found in children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy and meningitis, the high incidence of MRV detected by environmental surveillance warrants further investigation.","publish_time":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Matthew C.

Based on updated field investigation and in-depth interviews between 2008 and 2012, the study argues that the Greater PRD has undergone dramatic restructuring of regional governance since mid 2000s, reflected by rescaling attempts initiated by Guangdong provincial government and bottom-up resistance from local residents in Hong Kong. The interaction of the rescaling dynamics has engendered the contested geopolitics of the cross-boundary governance as the regional integration intensified. Notably, the complexity of cross-boundary governance has been heightened by emerging conflicts, resulted from the increasing number of mainlanders as \u2018individual visitors\u2019 to Hong Kong since the implementation of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the first bilateral free trade agreement between Hong Kong and China effective from 2004.

Many infections are observed upon travel and migration, and the clinical spectrum is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe septic shock. The severity of infection depends on the etiology and timeliness of diagnosis. While assessing the etiology of severe infection in travelers and migrants, it is important to acquire a detailed clinical history; geography, dates of travel, places visited, type of transportation, lay-overs and intermediate stops, potential exposure to exotic diseases, and activities that were undertaken during travelling and prophylaxis and vaccines either taken or not before travel are all important parameters. Tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, visceral leishmaniasis, enteric fever and hemorrhagic fever are the most common etiologies in severely infected travelers and migrants. The management of severe sepsis and septic shock in migrants and returning travelers requires a systematic approach in the evaluation of these patients based on travel history. Early and broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for the management of septic shock comprising broad spectrum antibiotics, source control, fluid therapy and hemodynamic support, corticosteroids, tight glycemic control, and organ support and monitoring. We here review the diagnostic and therapeutic routing of severely ill travelers and migrants, stratified by the nature of the infectious agents most often encountered among them.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alp, E.; Erdem, H.; Rello, J.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f04bc07b4158b33260f0b390b2371dd520b9312.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-016-2575-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26825315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["migrants","severe septic shock","travel history","management of septic shock","etiology of severe infection","ill travelers","infected travelers","dates of travel","clinical spectrum","management of severe sepsis","asymptomatic infection","severity of infection","infectious diseases","detailed clinical history","source control","hemodynamic support","hemorrhagic fever","enteric fever","organ support","fluid therapy","broad-spectrum therapy","exotic diseases","important parameters","borderless world","infectious agents","developed world","tight glycemic control","broad spectrum antibiotics","visceral leishmaniasis","corticosteroids","potential exposure","overs","intermediate stops","pneumonia","geography","common etiologies","global human movement","places","therapeutic routing","past decade","malaria","type of transportation","evaluation","systematic approach","patients","migration","diagnostic","Tuberculosis","activities","monitoring","nature","timeliness of diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

Communities in which bat guano is mined from caves have extensive exposure to bat excreta, often harvest bats for consumption, and are at risk for bat-borne diseases. METHODS: This rapid ethnographic study was conducted in four provinces of Thailand (Ratchaburi, Sakaeo, Nakorn Sawan, and Phitsanulok), where bat guano was mined and sold during the period April\u2013August 2014. The aim of this study was to understand behaviors and risk perceptions associated with bat conservation, exposure to bats and their excreta, and bat consumption. Sixty-seven respondents playing various roles in bat guano mining, packaging, sale, and use as fertilizer participated in the study. Data were collected through interviews and/or focus group discussions. RESULTS: In spite of a bat conservation program dating back to the 1980s, the benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption were not clear and infrequently articulated by study respondents. DISCUSSION: Since bat consumption continues, albeit covertly, the risk of bat-borne diseases remains high. There is an opportunity to reduce the risk of bat-borne diseases in guano-mining communities by strengthening bat conservation efforts and raising awareness of the health risks of bat consumption. Further research is suggested to test behavior change strategies for reducing bat consumption.","publish_time":"2016-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suwannarong, Kanokwan; Schuler, Sidney","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/541efff1146fcb123189ad615099b67769ed41c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4724787.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3402/iee.v6.29941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26806167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["risk of bat","bat excreta","bat guano mining","health risks of bat consumption","bat conservation efforts","bat conservation program","Human consumption of bats","diseases","study respondents","guano-mining communities","risk perceptions","benefits of conserving bats","rapid ethnographic study","extensive exposure","increasing public health threat","Sakaeo","awareness","caves","various roles","Ratchaburi","Phitsanulok","sale","packaging","Nakorn Sawan","provinces of Thailand","spite","behaviors","interviews","METHODS","BACKGROUND","strategies","group discussions","fertilizer","RESULTS","opportunity","Data","research","aim","period"],"language":"en"},

Renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) is known to function in the development of PAH. Losartan, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a well-known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a recently found regulator of RAS. To determine the effect of losartan on smoke-induced PAH and its possible mechanism, rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6months in the absence and in the presence of losartan. Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreased ACE2 levels were observed in smoke-exposed-only rats. Losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibited the smoke-induced RVSP and Ang II elevation and partially reversed the ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. In cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from 3- and 6-month smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3-month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Consistent with the in vivo study, in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 reduction in rat PASMCs. The results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH and ACE2 may be involved as part of its mechanism. Our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.","publish_time":"2010-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Su-Xia; He, Guang-Ming; Wang, Tao; Chen, Lei; Ning, Yun-Ye; Luo, Feng; An, Jin; Yang, Ting; Dong, Jia-Jia; Liao, Zeng-lin; Xu, Dan; Wen, Fu-Qiang","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52ef40cbfbd93f506eb4d57a15a7fac62a43e778.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103128.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X10000608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178811/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2010.02.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X10000608","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Losartan"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["smoke-induced PAH","month smoke-exposed rats","month exposed rats","smoke-induced RVSP","ACE2 reduction","ACE2 inhibitor","presence of losartan","control rats","development of PAH","losartan pretreatment","Losartan administration","effect of losartan","cigarette smoke extract","decreased ACE2 levels","pulmonary vascular remodeling","PAH smokers","increased angiotensin","specific angiotensin","rat PASMCs","angiotensin system","pulmonary arterial hypertension","thickened wall of pulmonary arteries","chronic smoking","induced cell proliferation","Abstract Chronic cigarette smoking","study","cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells","rat lungs","possible mechanism","presence of DX600","regulator of RAS","development of new therapeutic interventions","apparent medial hypertrophy","receptor antagonist","CSE","well-known antihypertensive drug","potential role","ventricular systolic pressure","insight","absence","elevation","Renin","months","enzyme","unknown mechanisms","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a PDCoV isolate, CHN-SC2015, was isolated from Sichuan Province in southwest China. The isolate was characterized by a cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. CHN-SC2015 titers in LLC-PK cells ranged from 10(4.31) to 10(8.22) TCID(50)/mL during the first 30 passages. During serial passage, 11 nucleotide mutations occurred in the S gene, resulting in nine amino acid changes. A whole genome sequencing analysis demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 shares 97.5%\u201399.1% identity with 59 reference strains in GenBank. Furthermore, CHN-SC2015 contained 6-nt deletion and 9-nt insertion in the ORF1ab gene, 3-nt deletion in the S gene and 11-nt deletion in its 3\u2032UTR compared with other reference strains available in GenBank. A phylogenetic analysis showed that CHN-SC2015 is more closely related to other PDCoV strains in China than to the strains from Southeast Asia, USA, Japan, and South Korea, indicating the diversity of genetic relationships and regional and epidemic characteristics among these strains. A recombination analysis indicated that CHN-SC2015 experienced recombination events between SHJS/SL/2016 and TT-1115. In vivo infection demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 is highly pathogenic to sucking piglets, causing diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death. Virus was shed daily in the feces of infected piglets and upon necropsy, was found distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and in multiple organs.

DESIGN: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. METHODS: The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations. RESULTS: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure \u226565 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7\u20139 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a Pao (2)/Fio (2) ratio of \u2264100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao (2)/Fi o (2) \u003C150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are \u003E180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose \u2264180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5\u201310 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven \u201Cabsolute\u201D\u2019 adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Decrease of cellular mRNA is observed during ASFV infection, suggesting that inhibition of cellular proteins is due to an active mRNA degradation process. ASFV carries a gene (Ba71V D250R/Malawi g5R) that encodes a decapping protein (ASFV-DP) that has a Nudix hydrolase motif and decapping activity in vitro. Here, we show that ASFV-DP was expressed from early times and accumulated throughout the infection with a subcellular localization typical of the endoplasmic reticulum, colocalizing with the cap structure and interacting with the ribosomal protein L23a. ASFV-DP was capable of interaction with poly(A) RNA in cultured cells, primarily mediated by the N-terminal region of the protein. ASFV-DP also interacted with viral and cellular RNAs in the context of infection, and its overexpression in infected cells resulted in decreased levels of both types of transcripts. This study points to ASFV-DP as a viral decapping enzyme involved in both the degradation of cellular mRNA and the regulation of viral transcripts. IMPORTANCE Virulent ASFV strains cause a highly infectious and lethal disease in domestic pigs for which there is no vaccine. Since 2007, an outbreak in the Caucasus region has spread to Russia, jeopardizing the European pig population and making it essential to deepen knowledge about the virus. Here, we demonstrate that ASFV-DP is a novel RNA-binding protein implicated in the regulation of mRNA metabolism during infection, making it a good target for vaccine development.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quintas, Ana; P\u00E9rez-N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Daniel; S\u00E1nchez, Elena G.; Nogal, Maria L.; Hentze, Matthias W.; Castell\u00F3, Alfredo; Revilla, Yolanda","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb44482e84ab91364682dfbcdb7ee5c9dd394f74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5709586.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00990-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV"],"locations":["Caucasus","Russia"],"keyphrases":["ASFV-DP","ASFV infection","decapping protein","cellular protein synthesis","viral protein synthesis","degradation of cellular mRNA","IMPORTANCE Virulent ASFV strains","context of infection","cellular RNAs","viral decapping enzyme","regulation of viral transcripts","ribosomal protein L23a","novel RNA-binding protein","inhibition of cellular proteins","regulation of mRNA metabolism","decapping activity","active mRNA degradation process","infected cells","African swine fever virus","cultured cells","progressive decrease","Caucasus region","types of transcripts","vaccine development","N-terminal region","concomitant increase","endoplasmic reticulum","decreased levels","Malawi g5R","subcellular localization typical","colocalizing","Russia","cap structure","gene","Ba71V D250R","overexpression","poly","Nudix hydrolase motif","lethal disease","domestic pigs","capable of interaction","European pig population","good target","mechanism","early times","study points","outbreak","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Design Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. Setting Wuxi, Eastern China. Participants Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. Main outcomes measures Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. Results The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. Conclusions The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person. The transmissibility was limited and non-sustainable.","publish_time":"2013-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Xian; Qian, Yan-Hua; Bao, Chang-Jun; Guo, Xi-Ling; Cui, Lun-Biao; Tang, Fen-Yang; Ji, Hong; Huang, Yong; Cai, Pei-Quan; Lu, Bing; Xu, Ke; Shi, Chao; Zhu, Feng-Cai; Zhou, Ming-Hao; Wang, Hua","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3805478.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f4752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23920350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern China"],"keyphrases":["avian H7N9","patients","close contacts","person","rRT-PCR","unprotected exposure","novel avian influenza H7N9 virus","negative results","history of exposure","known exposure","index patient","haemagglutination inhibition assays","haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific","days","daughter","isolated strains","father","poultry","results of laboratory testing of pathogens","Paired serum samples","serological testing","family cluster","relevant environments","analyses of phylogenetic trees","unprotected bedside care","real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","analysis of sequences","viral culture","Clinical data","hospital","onset of illnesses","Main outcomes","Genome sequence","Design Epidemiological investigations","mild illness","viruses","Participants","Wuxi","Eastern China","transmissibility","Conclusions","infection","symptoms","Objective","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

It is argued that none of these accounts of a physician\u2019s professional obligations unequivocally supports the incompatibility thesis.","publish_time":"2008-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wicclair, Mark R.","journal":"Theor Med Bioeth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de455c57110a09ce5e82b881557f490cb9779fd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089235.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11017-008-9075-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18752039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physician\u2019s professional obligations","professional obligations of physicians","incompatibility thesis","accounts","medical services","general ethical theories","non-essentialist conceptions","rights-based theories","contractarianism","internal morality","reciprocal justice","conscientious objection","underlying assumption","consequentialism","social contract","article","religious beliefs","response"],"language":"en"},

By a simple impregnation procedure, TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized firmly onto the surface of a cordierite foam substrate through high-temperature (500\u00B0C) calcination. The strong bactericidal performance of the fabricated foam was evaluated by a newly developed test method for complex three-dimensional through-pore structures. This method could trace 5\u20136log units of decrease in bacterial cell numbers in an air environment, thus meeting the criteria of both the JIS and ISO standard test methods. With 0.25mWcm\u22122 of UV-A irradiation for 24h, the bactericidal rate of the TiO2/cordierite foam exceeded 99.9% for five types of airborne or droplet-based infectious pathogens: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The results of repeat testing, where the same sample was used three times, revealed that the bactericidal rate for E. coli was maintained at 99.9% in the second and third use, indicating that the TiO2/cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action. The TiO2/cordierite foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation capability on gaseous acetaldehyde, which is associated with sick building syndrome, and volatile organic compounds to generate CO2 and H2O. The results demonstrated that TiO2-coated cordierite foam has great potential for use in air-cleaning filters with not only high bactericidal performance to remove pathogens in the air and in droplets, but also strong decontaminating and deodorizing functionality.","publish_time":"2011-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Yanyan; Ochiai, Tsuyoshi; Ishiguro, Hitoshi; Nakano, Ryuichi; Kubota, Yoshinobu","journal":"Applied Catalysis B: Environmental","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2332b42c6c135193ad38e0d6d6b22aaa469c845b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127110.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926337311002967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288263/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337311002967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","E. coli"],"organizations":["H2O"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TiO2-coated cordierite foam","cordierite foam substrate","fabricated foam","TiO2 nanoparticles","bactericidal rate","novel titanium dioxide-coated cordierite foam","high bactericidal performance","strong bactericidal performance","use","air environment","air cleaners","long-term bactericidal action","high-temperature","air-cleaning filters","Escherichia coli","developed test method","high photocatalytic degradation capability","infectious pathogens","strong decontaminating","Legionella pneumophila","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Klebsiella pneumoniae","results of repeat testing","ISO standard test methods","bacterial cell numbers","great potential","volatile organic compounds","gaseous acetaldehyde","sick building syndrome","log units of decrease","JIS","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","MRSA","CO2","criteria","simple impregnation procedure","droplets","surface","pore structures","types of airborne","UV","sample","H2O","deodorizing functionality","irradiation","times","calcination","mWcm"],"language":"en"},

Although Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is characterized by a risk of nosocomial transmission, the detailed mode of transmission and period of virus shedding from infected patients are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to investigate the potential role of environmental contamination by MERS-CoV in healthcare settings and to define the period of viable virus shedding from MERS patients. Methods. We investigated environmental contamination from 4 patients in MERS-CoV units of 2 hospitals. MERS-CoV was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viable virus was isolated by cultures. Results. Many environmental surfaces of MERS patient rooms, including points frequently touched by patients or healthcare workers, were contaminated by MERS-CoV. Viral RNA was detected up to five days from environmental surfaces following the last positive PCR from patients\u2019 respiratory specimens. MERS-CoV RNA was detected in samples from anterooms, medical devices, and air-ventilating equipment. In addition, MERS-CoV was isolated from environmental objects such as bed sheets, bedrails, IV fluid hangers, and X-ray devices. During the late clinical phase of MERS, viable virus could be isolated in 3 of the 4 enrolled patients on day 18 to day 25 after symptom onset. Conclusions. Most of touchable surfaces in MERS units were contaminated by patients and health care workers and the viable virus could shed through respiratory secretion from clinically fully recovered patients. These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices, and sufficient isolation period based on laboratory results rather than solely on clinical symptoms.","publish_time":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bin, Seo Yu; Heo, Jung Yeon; Song, Min-Suk; Lee, Jacob; Kim, Eun-Ha; Park, Su-Jin; Kwon, Hyeok-il; Kim, Se mi; Kim, Young-il; Si, Young-Jae; Lee, In-Won; Baek, Yun Hee; Choi, Won-Suk; Min, Jinsoo; Jeong, Hye Won; Choi, Young Ki","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c9247f45d1753097c240b772fff1d0fd97a12a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26679623/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ1020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","RNA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS patients","MERS-CoV units","MERS-CoV RNA","MERS units","environmental surfaces of MERS patient rooms","period of virus","period of viable virus","recovered patients","enrolled patients","infected patients","late clinical phase of MERS","environmental objects","potential role of environmental contamination","strict environmental surface hygiene practices","respiratory secretion","healthcare workers","laboratory results","touchable surfaces","sufficient isolation period","patients\u2019 respiratory specimens","positive PCR","medical devices","healthcare settings","X-ray devices","clinical symptoms","Viral RNA","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","detailed mode of transmission","health care workers","risk of nosocomial transmission","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","need","fluid hangers","bed sheets","bedrails","anterooms","samples","points","air-ventilating equipment","study","days","hospitals","symptom onset","cultures","addition","aims","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The overall objective of this study was to explore FIV-induced alterations in cell counts and cytokine gene expression in the pulmonary compartment during the acute stage infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were collected from FIV-infected and control cats at 0, 4, 10, and 16 weeks post-FIV infection for phenotype and cytokine analysis. The major change in BAL cellular populations following FIV-infection was the development of a neutrophilia. Total BAL cell counts and relative numbers of alveolar macrophages (AM), eosinophils, and lymphocytes remained similar in both groups. The RT-qcPCR analyses of AM purified from BAL showed constitutive expression of TNF\u03B1, IL6 and IL10 mRNAs that peaked during the acute stage of infection then declined. The TNF\u03B1 and IL6 bioactive protein secretion showed a similar response. In contrast, IFN\u03B3 expression increased progressively with time after infection and paralleled a progressive increase in FIV-gag mRNA in AM. The IL12 p40 expression also differed from the other cytokines in that there was a progressive decrease in the number of cats with AM IL12 expression following FIV infection. Infection of AM in vitro with FIV also caused an increase in TNF\u03B1 and IL6 mRNA and bioactive protein suggesting that the increased cytokine response by AM following infection of cats with FIV is an intrinsic characteristic of FIV-infected AM. In summary, pulmonary immune changes seen in FIV-infected cats are similar to those seen in HIV-infected human patients.","publish_time":"2001-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ritchey, Jerry W; Levy, Julie K; Bliss, Susan K; Tompkins, Wayne A.F; Tompkins, Mary B","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abd20e33c3e08a2d1beed89375fcae1e510dd99a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172897.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242701002501; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242701002501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIV-infection","FIV-infected cats","infection of cats","weeks post-FIV infection","FIV-gag mRNA","FIV-induced alterations","intrinsic characteristic of FIV","acute stage infection","acute stage of infection","IL12 expression","cytokine gene expression","constitutive expression of TNF\u03B1","IFN\u03B3 expression","IL12 p40 expression","IL6 mRNA","number of cats","similar response","pulmonary immunodeficiency","control cats","Total BAL cell","increased cytokine response","IL6 bioactive protein secretion","pulmonary compartment","cytokine analysis","BAL cellular populations","progressive increase","HIV-infected human patients","pulmonary immune changes","progressive decrease","feline immunodeficiency virus","phenotype","relative numbers of alveolar macrophages","IL10 mRNAs","summary","cells","major change","eosinophils","study","time","Evidence","lymphocytes","Bronchoalveolar lavage","development","RT-qcPCR analyses","overall objective","groups","contrast","neutrophilia","cytokines"],"language":"en"},

In particular, H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry. Ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains. RESULTS: Transcriptomic sequencing of lung and ileum tissue samples from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has allowed us to compare the early host response to these infections in both these species. Chickens (but not ducks) lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135. These differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks. We reveal very different patterns of expression of members of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family in ducks and chickens. In ducks, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion. We also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. In particular, avian IFITM1 showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 protein family and RIG-I all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.

Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calder, Philip C; Carr, Anitra C; Gombart, Adrian F; Eggersdorfer, Manfred","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12041181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recommended Dietary Allowance","RDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vitamins C","immune system","public health officials","Public health practices","omega","impact of infections","supplementation","fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid","optimal immune function","docosahexaenoic acid","specific nutrients","Acute respiratory tract infections","disease burden","Recommended Dietary Allowance","global burden of infection","recommended upper safety limits","zinc","vaccinations","complementary roles","low-cost strategy","iron","trace elements","folate","example","RDA","consequence","handwashing","B12","B6","clinical data","selenium","magnesium","additional measures","status","nutritional strategies","spread","increase","recommendations","micronutrients","wealth of mechanistic","Inadequate intake","copper","decrease","resistance","role nutrition","background","following conclusions","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Bluetongue virus is the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), a disease of ruminants, mostly transmitted by competent Culicoides species. In Israel, BTV-3 circulation was first detected in 2013 from a sheep showing classical BT clinical signs. It was also evidenced in 2016, and, since then, it has been regularly detected in Israeli livestock. Between 2013 and 2017, BTV-3 outbreaks were limited in sheep flocks located in the southern area only. In 2018, BTV-3 was instead found in the Israeli coastal area being one of the dominant BTV serotypes isolated from symptomatic sheep, cattle and goats. In Israeli sheep, BTV-3 was able to cause BT classical clinical manifestations and fatalities, while in cattle and goats infection ranged from asymptomatic forms to death cases, depending on either general welfare of the herds or on the occurrence of viral and bacterial co-infections. Three different BTV-3 strains were identified in Israel between 2013 and 2018: ISR-2019/13 isolated in 2013, ISR-2153/16 and ISR-2262/2/16 isolated in 2016. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of these strains showed more than 99% identity by segment (Seg) 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 sequences. In contrast, a wide range of diversity among these strains was exhibited in other viral gene segments, implying the occurrence of genome reassortment between these local circulating strains and those originating from Africa. The genome sequences of the BTV-3 isolated in 2017 and 2018 were most closely related to those of the ISR-2153/16 strain suggesting their common ancestor. Comparison of BTV-3 Israeli strains with those recently detected in the Mediterranean region uncovered high percentage identity (98.19\u201398.28%) only between Seg-2 of all Israeli strains and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. A 98.93% identity was also observed between Seg-4 sequences of ISR-2019/13 and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. This study demonstrated that BTV-3 has been circulating in the Mediterranean region at least since 2013, but, unlike the other Mediterranean strains, Israeli BTV-3 were able to cause clinical signs also in cattle.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Golender, Natalia; Bumbarov, Velizar; Eldar, Avi; Lorusso, Alessio; Kenigswald, Gabriel; Varsano, Joseph Seffi; David, Dan; Schainin, Shani; Dagoni, Ilan; Gur, Iosef; Kaplan, Alon; Gorohov, Anna; Koren, Ori; Oron, Eldad; Khinich, Yevgeny; Sclamovich, Ily; Meir, Abraham; Savini, Giovanni","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90637e4f46c7466511a622cb1cce5ed3c8eb4f3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211429/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00112","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kimron Veterinary Institute (Beit Dagan","BT"],"locations":["Israel","Africa","Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["Israeli BTV","Comparison of BTV","different BTV","Israeli strains","Mediterranean strains","dominant BTV serotypes","Israeli sheep","sequences of ISR","Israeli livestock","local circulating strains","cattle","Israeli coastal area","symptomatic sheep","sheep flocks","classical BT clinical signs","TUN2016 strain","Mediterranean region","genome sequences","BT classical clinical manifestations","occurrence of viral","Bluetongue virus serotype","Zarzis","occurrence of genome reassortment","causative agent of bluetongue","high percentage identity","goats infection","southern area","viral gene segments","fatalities","asymptomatic forms","diagnostic activities","death cases","Beit Dagan","Kimron Veterinary Institute","results","herds","bacterial co-infections","wide range of diversity","general welfare","disease of ruminants","contrast","Sequencing","phylogenetic analysis","outbreaks","competent Culicoides species","common ancestor","paper","Africa","circulation","study"],"language":"en"},

Of 678 patients who underwent HSCT during the study period, 112 (17%) developed HCoV infection, making HCoV the fourth most common respiratory viral infection. Thirty-four (30%) HCoV-infected patients progressed to proven or probable lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).

Flavivirus NS1 is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in blood, is displayed on the surface of infected cells, and has been hypothesized to have immune evasion functions. Herein, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation by directly interacting with C4. Binding of NS1 to C4 reduced C4b deposition and C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. Although NS1 bound C4b, it lacked intrinsic cofactor activity to degrade C4b, and did not block C3 convertase formation or accelerate decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Instead, NS1 enhanced C4 cleavage by recruiting and activating the complement-specific protease C1s. By binding C1s and C4 in a complex, NS1 promotes efficient degradation of C4 to C4b. Through this mechanism, NS1 protects DENV from complement-dependent neutralization in solution. These studies define a novel immune evasion mechanism for restricting complement control of microbial infection.","publish_time":"2010-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avirutnan, Panisadee; Fuchs, Anja; Hauhart, Richard E.; Somnuke, Pawit; Youn, Soonjeon; Diamond, Michael S.; Atkinson, John P.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5da7614b7c0356227846a0e1b168a7e6efd67c93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2856034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308361/; https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20092545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Binding of NS1","NS1 bound C4b","Flavivirus NS1","NS1 enhanced C4 cleavage","complement system","C4b deposition","efficient degradation of C4","complement-dependent neutralization","DENV","dengue virus","C3 convertase formation","complement-specific protease C1s","binding C1s","complement control of microbial infection","novel immune evasion mechanism","West Nile virus","yellow fever virus","immune evasion functions","intrinsic cofactor activity","essential protective role","WNV","decay","YFV","complex","initial defense","secreted nonstructural glycoprotein","lectin pathway activation","C4b2a","blood","studies","C5 convertases","solution","surface of infected cells","microorganisms"],"language":"en"},

As with all animal production systems, it is subject to the risk of outbreak of transboundary diseases. In the present overview, evaluations of the perceived risk of selected transboundary animal diseases of pigs, as collated from the willing participants from the provincial veterinary services of South Africa, are presented. A scenario tree revealed that infected but undetected pigs were the greatest perceived threat. The provincial veterinary services, according to participants in the study, face certain difficulties, including the reporting of disease and the flow of disease information amongst farmers. Perceived strengths in surveillance and disease monitoring include the swiftness of sample despatch to the national testing laboratory, as well as the ease of flow of information between the provincial and national agricultural authorities. The four factors were identified that were perceived to most influence animal health-service delivery: transport, access, livestock policy and resources. African swine fever was perceived to be the most important pig disease in South Africa. Because the decentralisation of veterinary services in South Africa was identified as a potential weakness, it is recommended that national and provincial veterinary services need to work together and interdependently to achieve centrally controlled surveillance systems.

This pathogen may survive in the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. Infection Transmission occurs via the faecal\u2013oral route. Indirect contact is the most common route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. Disease signs Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high \u2013 over 90% in kittens. Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (in kittens only) and abortion. Diagnosis Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. Vaccination recommendations All cats \u2013 including indoor cats \u2013 should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8\u20139 weeks of age and 3\u20134 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16\u201320 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more. Modified-live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnant queens or in kittens less than 4 weeks of age.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Truyen, Uwe; Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f28d99f0bdfb16c5fa56764d922953ab797bfc8e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001144; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kittens","indoor cats","Infection Transmission","weeks of age","Disease signs Cats","FPV","adult cats","high infection pressure","infection of neonates","common route of infection","Signs of disease","Intrauterine virus transmission","Abstract Overview Feline panleukopenia virus","faeces","Diagnosis Feline panleukopenia virus antigen","live virus vaccines","Mortality rates","Vaccination recommendations","disinfectants","sodium hydroxide","sodium hypochlorite","Disease management Supportive therapy","pregnant queens","oral route","high vaccine-induced antibody levels","Subsequent booster vaccinations","good nursing","peracetic acid","formaldehyde","bleach","transient","cat shelters","parenteral administration","thrombocytopenia","anaemia","PCR testing","neutropenia","immunosuppression","lymphopenia","environments","breeding catteries","cerebellar ataxia","diarrhoea","clothing","felids","ages","cases of enteritis","broad-spectrum antibiotic","raccoons","mink","Specialised laboratories","intervals","available test kits","Indirect contact","blood","fomites","months","foxes","shoes","risk","Serological tests","pathogen","years","injections","abortion"],"language":"en"},

Infectious prion proteins are causative agents of many mammalian TSEs, including scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; in cattle), and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD; in humans). BSE, better known as mad cow disease, is among the many recently discovered zoonotic diseases. BSE cases were first reported in the United Kingdom in 1986. Variant CJD (vCJD) is a disease that was first detected in 1996, which affects humans and is linked to the BSE epidemic in cattle. vCJD is presumed to be caused by consumption of contaminated meat and other food products derived from affected cattle. The BSE epidemic peaked in 1992 and decreased thereafter; this decline is continuing sharply owing to intensive surveillance and screening programs in the Western world. However, there are still new outbreaks and/or progression of prion diseases, including atypical BSE, and iatrogenic CJD and vCJD via organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This paper summarizes studies on prions, particularly on prion molecular mechanisms, BSE, vCJD, and diagnostic procedures. Risk perception and communication policies of the European Union for the prevention of prion diseases are also addressed to provide recommendations for appropriate government policies in Korea.","publish_time":"2013-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jeongmin; Kim, Su Yeon; Hwang, Kyu Jam; Ju, Young Ran; Woo, Hee-Jong","journal":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/146b172b4d58fc5acb9d061649f4a925f477e37c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f956e0b68eaf7bac8fa50f0d1a9859938a96f8ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3747681.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221090991200104X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24159531/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2012.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221090991200104X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["BSE epidemic","vCJD","atypical BSE","BSE cases","progression of prion diseases","prevention of prion diseases","Jakob disease","zoonotic diseases","prion molecular mechanisms","Infectious prion proteins","iatrogenic CJD","chronic wasting disease","Variant CJD","affected cattle","mad cow disease","humans","mammalian TSEs","communication policies","bovine spongiform encephalopathy","transmissible spongiform encephalopathies","appropriate government policies","lead","deer","elk","causative agents","organ transplantation","European Union","food products","screening programs","neurological dysfunction","prions","recommendations","sheep","intensive surveillance","animals","Korea","scrapie","blood transfusion","Creutzfeldt","consumption of contaminated meat","Western world","Risk perception","studies","diagnostic procedures","new outbreaks","paper","United Kingdom","decline"],"language":"en"},

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as an isothermal gene amplification technique, has been explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. METHODS: A real-time reverse transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of canine distemper virus (CDV) using primers and exo probe targeting the CDV nucleocapsid protein gene was developed. A series of other viruses were tested by the RT-RPA.Thirty-two field samples were further tested by RT-RPA, and the resuts were compared with those obtained by the real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The RT-RPA assay was performed successfully at 40 \u00B0C, and the results were obtained within 3 min\u201312 min. The assay could detect CDV, but did not show cross-detection of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), demonstrating high specificity. The analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA was 31.8 copies in vitro transcribed CDV RNA, which is 10 times lower than the real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was validated by testing 32 field samples and compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-RPA and a reference real-time RT-PCR method. Both assays provided the same results, and R(2) value of the positive results was 0.947. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the RT-RPA assay offers an alternative tool for simple, rapid, and reliable detection of CDV both in the laboratory and point-of-care facility, especially in the resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jianchang; Wang, Jinfeng; Li, Ruiwen; Liu, Libing; Yuan, Wanzhe","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd9c2af38cd8dd7a06b25e2cd2233a74a48a37cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5558738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28810858/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1180-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV","RT-RPA","Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-RPA assay","detection of canine distemper virus","reference real-time RT-PCR method","analytical sensitivity of RT","canine parainfluenza virus","real-time reverse transcription RPA","reliable detection of CDV","canine coronavirus","canine parvovirus","positive results","pseudorabies virus","assay performance","Newcastle disease virus","transcribed CDV RNA","CDV nucleocapsid protein gene","cross-detection","field samples","molecular detection of diverse pathogens","isothermal gene amplification technique","fatal systemic disease","Recombinase polymerase amplification","exo probe","PRV","CPIV","primers","alternative tool","NDV","CCoV","times lower","copies","captive carnivores","point","laboratory","CPV","METHODS","excellent correlation","care facility","value","resource-limited settings","high specificity","viruses","BACKGROUND","resuts","series","assays","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction: Humanity is facing a global pandemic at the start of 2020. The health systems of each country are reorganizing to cope with an influx of patients. This crisis reorganization is the source of psychological tension that can lead to symptomatic manifestations in many caregivers. This situation is similar in many points to that encountered by soldiers on external operations (loss of usual bearings, feeling of threat, focusing of attention on the crisis, deterioration of living conditions with limitation of the possibility of taking breaks). The aim of this work is to describe at the hospital level the changes in the professional and personal environment linked to the crisis likely to cause stress and then to describe the clinical manifestations observed both on an individual and collective level. Analysis of the situation: In this chapter, after having described the reorganization of the hospital in which we operate, we try to identify various factors likely to have psychological repercussions such as: the perceived urgency of the situation, the achievement of privacy, the reorganization of the work tool and the exercise of unusual tasks in newly formed teams, but also the fear of lack, the anxiety linked to contamination, the uncertainties linked to the threat. Clinical Description: In this chapter, we describe the clinical manifestations observed in the caregivers of the hospital in reaction to the crisis. Rather than decompensations, they are mainly anxious manifestations characterized by an increase in somatic concerns, an accentuation of verification rituals, an increase in snacking and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances (coffee, tobacco) and for certain people a character stiffening. On a collective level, it was mainly the misuse of social networks reflecting the group\u0027s anxieties (search for meaning and responsibility, need for certainty) that was observed. Conclusion: We then conclude with a description of the approach that led to the establishment of a support system by offering a graduated response, re-assessable over time, compatible with the maintenance of usual activity while maintaining a therapeutic distance.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilles, Thomas","journal":"Annales M\u00E9dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1144db41f908b9c3a0011f8798a99b620509aeb8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301578; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301578?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Les","Dans","Entre"],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["pr\u00E9paration \u00E0","clinical manifestations","faire face \u00E0","crisis reorganization","symptomatic manifestations","anxious manifestations","hospital level","\u00E9quipes hospitali\u00E8res sont soumises \u00E0","Entre l\u2019angoisse li\u00E9e \u00E0","\u00EAtre th\u00E9rapeutique et participer efficacement \u00E0","nous rapprocher","normal et","Clinical Description","collective level","mise en mot","nous avons interrompu","nouvelles \u00E9quipes et","soin sont appel\u00E9s \u00E0 se mobiliser afin","l\u2019exception nous para\u00EEt en effet \u00EAtre","sont marqu\u00E9s en France par une situation","mise en place d\u2019un dispositif","stress que nous avons observ\u00E9s","manifestations psychopathologiques individuelles et collectives constat\u00E9es lors","crise sanitaire exceptionnelle","increase","contamination","caregivers","chapter","threat","patients Covid afin","soutien psychologique adapt\u00E9","therapeutic distance","certain people","psychological repercussions","work tool","influx of patients","cette psychopathologie ordinaire","loss of usual bearings","maintenance of usual activity","source of psychological tension","pr\u00E9alable indispensable au maintien d\u2019une distance n\u00E9cessaire","Psychiatre exer\u00E7ant au sein d\u2019un h\u00F4pital d\u2019instruction","cette p\u00E9riode si particuli\u00E8re","consumption of certain psychoactive substances","diff\u00E9rents facteurs","d\u00E9crire","services susceptibles d\u2019accueillir","notre activit\u00E9 programm\u00E9e","arm\u00E9es","l\u2019ann\u00E9e","majeure partie","apr\u00E8s avoir fait l\u2019inventaire","r\u00E9organis\u00E9","leur proposer","graduated response","time","l\u2019ensemble","tobacco","snacking","coffee","formation","effort d\u2019adaptation majeur","personnelle","accentuation of verification rituals","ce propos","premiers mois","incertitudes concernant","exercise of unusual tasks","group\u0027s anxieties","limitation","r\u00E9am\u00E9nagement","external operations","menace","travail","deterioration of living conditions","somatic concerns","modifications","changes","formed teams","misuse of social networks","Humanity","search","possibility","support system","soldiers","l\u2019outil","anxiety","personal environment","perceived urgency","achievement of privacy","global pandemic","Dans l\u2019urgence","fear of lack","responsibility","establishment","L\u2019objet","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","character stiffening","various factors","points","uncertainties","attention","reaction","Abstract Introduction","health systems","country","start","breaks","approach","decompensations","certainty","aim","Analysis","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Host cell factors required for viral spread but not for cellular survival are attractive targets for novel approaches to antiviral intervention. The cleavage activation of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. However, it is unknown which proteases activate influenza viruses in mammals. Several candidates have been identified in cell culture studies, leading to the concept that influenza viruses can employ multiple enzymes to ensure their cleavage activation in the host. Here, we show that deletion of a single HA-activating protease gene, Tmprss2, in mice inhibits spread of mono-basic H1N1 influenza viruses, including the pandemic 2009 swine influenza virus. Lung pathology was strongly reduced and mutant mice were protected from weight loss, death and impairment of lung function. Also, after infection with mono-basic H3N2 influenza A virus body weight loss and survival was less severe in Tmprss2 mutant compared to wild type mice. As expected, Tmprss2-deficient mice were not protected from viral spread and pathology after infection with multi-basic H7N7 influenza A virus. In conclusion, these results identify TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor essential for viral spread and pathogenesis of mono-basic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatesuer, Bastian; Bertram, Stephanie; Mehnert, Nora; Bahgat, Mahmoud M.; Nelson, Peter S.; P\u00F6hlman, Stefan; Schughart, Klaus","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4070000cd4a0880ff387df1d1a42f5f45f34e015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3857797.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24348248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus hemagglutinin","swine influenza virus","mono-basic H3N2 influenza","mono-basic H1N1 influenza viruses","viral spread","multi-basic H7N7 influenza","Annual influenza epidemics","host cell proteases","Host cell factors","Tmprss2 mutant","mutant mice","Tmprss2-deficient mice","host cell factor essential","viral infectivity","virus body weight loss","pathogenesis of mono","infection","cell culture studies","wild type mice","cleavage activation","Lung pathology","cellular survival","severe threat","single HA","impairment of lung function","novel approaches","attractive targets","occasional pandemics","multiple enzymes","death","concept","protease gene","antiviral intervention","results","human health","mammals","deletion","conclusion","candidates"],"language":"en"},

Contrary to all precautions and efforts the use of biological material in vaccine development and production may lead to potential contamination of the vaccines with known and unknown extraneous agents (EAs). In veterinary field official lists of EAs have been compiled as legal framework to describe the potential agents, which must be tested during manufacture of vaccines. Nevertheless, detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a common duty for manufacturers and authorities of both veterinary and human field sharing similar needs of special technical approaches. State-of-art molecular methods such as randomly primed PCR combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS) or microarrays may open new perspectives in extraneous agent testing. The robustness and efficacy of this technical approach in vaccine control was clearly demonstrated on a human vaccine example when porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine. The consequences and implications are reviewed hereby from a veterinary regulatory point of view.","publish_time":"2012-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farsang, Attila; Kulcs\u00E1r, G\u00E1bor","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdc06acb5635da09978b60894c373dc644e826a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575785/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2012.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104510561200067X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104510561200067X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human vaccine example","human rotavirus vaccine","human field","vaccine development","vaccine control","manufacture of vaccines","unknown extraneous agents","safety of commercial vaccines","potential contamination","potential agents","veterinary field official lists of EAs","unknown contaminants","veterinary regulatory point of view","extraneous agent testing","similar needs of special technical approaches","primed PCR","porcine circovirus type","use of biological material","microarrays","production","authorities","massive parallel sequencing","new perspectives","common duty","efforts","MPS","PCV1","manufacturers","Rotarix","art molecular methods","precautions","efficacy","legal framework","profound importance","State","robustness","quality","detection"],"language":"en"},

Ames, the virulent strain of B. anthracis, contains two plasmids that encode the antiphagocytic poly-\u03B3-d-glutamic acid capsule and the lethal toxin. The attenuated Sterne strain of B. anthracis, which lacks the plasmid encoding capsule, is widely adapted as a vaccine strain. Although differences in the outcome of infection with the two strains may have originated from the presence or absence of an anti-phagocytic capsule, the disease pathogenesis following infection will be manifested via the host responses, which is not well understood. To gain understanding of the host responses at cellular level, a microarray analysis was performed using primary rhesus macaque AMs infected with either Ames or Sterne spores. Notably, 528 human orthologs were identified to be differentially expressed in AMs infected with either strain of the B. anthracis. Meta-analyses revealed genes differentially expressed in response to B. anthracis infection were also induced upon infections with multiple pathogens such as Francisella Novicida or Staphylococcus aureus. This suggests the existence of a common molecular signature in response to pathogen infections. Importantly, the microarray and protein expression data for certain cytokines, chemokines and host factors provide further insights on how cellular processes such as innate immune sensing pathways, anti-apoptosis versus apoptosis may be differentially modulated in response to the virulent or vaccine strain of B. anthracis. The reported differences may account for the marked difference in pathogenicity between these two strains.","publish_time":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langel, Felicia D.; Chiang, Chih-Yuan; Lane, Douglas; Kenny, Tara; Ojeda, Jenifer F.; Zhong, Yang; Che, Jianwei; Zhou, Yingyao; Ribot, Wilson; Kota, Krishna P.; Bavari, Sina; Panchal, Rekha G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8679d8c149ea6d25afb92e8a4f4b622dadcd872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3917846.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Francisella Novicida"],"organizations":["Sterne"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anthracis infection","Bacillus anthracis","virulent strain of","vaccine strain of","attenuated Sterne strain of","host responses","chemokines","anti-apoptosis","anti-phagocytic capsule","host factors","Ames","outcome of infection","strains","certain cytokines","cellular processes","cellular level","d-glutamic acid capsule","microarray analysis","pathogen infections","primary rhesus macaque AMs","Sterne spores","reported differences","activation of innate immunity","innate immune sensing pathways","production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","common molecular signature","protein expression data","Francisella Novicida","antiphagocytic poly-\u03B3","insights","inhalation","disease pathogenesis","multiple pathogens","marked difference","lethal toxin","presence","absence","Staphylococcus aureus","Alveolar macrophages","existence","pathogenicity","plasmids","understanding","Meta-analyses","human orthologs"],"language":"en"},

Some evidence about the antiviral properties of lithium began in the early 1970s, when some reports found a reduction of labial-herpetic recurrences. The present review aims to present most of the pre-clinical and clinical evidence about lithium\u0027s ability to inhibit DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae, as well as the possible pathways and mechanisms involved in such antiviral activity. MAIN BODY Despite a broad number of in vitro studies, the rationale for the antiviral activity of lithium failed to translate into methodologically sound clinical studies demonstrating its antiviral efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of lithium as an antiviral agent should be addressed. In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid. Yet lithium reaches heterogeneous but bioequivalent concentrations in different tissues, and the anatomical compartment of the viral infection might underpin a different, lower need for tolerability concerns which need to be addressed. CONCLUSIONS Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings. In addition, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of lithium may provide an insight for its possible use as antiviral agent targeting specific pathways.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murru, Andrea; Manchia, Mirko; Hajek, Tomas; Nielsen, Ren\u00E9 E; Rybakowski, Janusz K; Sani, Gabriele; Schulze, Thomas G; Tondo, Leonardo; Bauer, Michael","journal":"International journal of bipolar disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435920/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-020-00191-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CONCLUSIONS Lithium"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of lithium","antiviral properties of lithium","tolerability of lithium","CONCLUSIONS Lithium","antiviral agent","antiviral efficacy","possible uses of lithium treatment","clear antiviral activity","clinical evidence","possible pathways","clinical settings","sound clinical studies","conditions different","different tissues","addition","line treatment option","tolerability concerns","specific pathways","lower need","present review","pleiotropic mechanisms of action","lithium\u0027s ability","naturalistic observations","DNA","serum levels","continuous monitoring","acute toxicity","modern medicine","introduction","anatomical compartment","recurring affective disorders","bioequivalent concentrations","insight","rationale","RNA viruses","broad number of","viral infection","reduction of labial","reports","effects","Coronaviridae","preclinical level","herpetic recurrences","MAIN BODY","BACKGROUND","fact","kidney","thyroid"],"language":"en"},

Present study shows that NNV perturbs mitochondrial dynamics by promoting Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission, which attenuates MAVS mediated downstream signaling. NNV infected SISS cells revealed induction in Drp1 expression and subsequent translocation into mitochondria. The level of MAVS expression was up-regulated over a period of 24 hpi and declined with the progression of NNV infection at 48 and 72 hpi confirmed by western blot and mRNA transcript analysis. Drp-1 displayed its association with fragmented mitochondria and the transcript abundance was significant post infection along with Mff. Expression levels of IRF-3 IFN-1 and Mx followed a similar pattern with abundant expression at 48 hpi and diminished expression during the further period. Importantly, silencing of Drp1 caused significant elevation in the RLR downstream molecules and reduction in viral RNA expression. These results suggest that NNV-induced mitochondrial fission serve to attenuate host RLR signaling.

Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others\u2019 views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions.

In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L","journal":"J Particip Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13ca3c0ac118c5e4f5ee9e63cca69ebd14247dbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Maryland","Central Texas","United States"],"keyphrases":["Central Texas residents","Maryland study","Maryland participants","influenza pandemic","Central Texas deliberants","health authorities","pandemic situation","public engagement study","pandemic planners","central consideration","ethical allocation framework","global health threat","pandemic-related public engagement exercises","ethical apportionment of scarce health resources","projected health needs","preferences of Maryland residents","current capacity of health care","local contexts","local history","practical implications","United States","deliberative democracy process","public policy matter","fairness of allocation decisions","communication of allocation frameworks","supplies of ventilators","Existing pandemic ethics discussions","family","diverse participants","fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment","ethical frames of reference","different regions","earlier research","moderated process","community members","cultural perspectives","role of community","cultural competence","finite supply of mechanical ventilators","scarcity dilemmas","intrastate variation","severe global outbreak of influenza","different ways of thinking","ethnic core value","place","policymakers","administration","responses","clear eligibility criteria","obligation of persons","extended families","inflected lens","Stark gaps","medical countermeasure systems","values","facts","concern","evidence of sameness","project team","inclusivity","culture","principal","protocol","attachment","interstate differences","experts","substance","benefits of transparency","themes","CONCLUSIONS","death matters","national levels","strong identification","previous exploration","BACKGROUND","important finding","half","Conveners","following questions","OBJECTIVE","advantage","METHODS","others\u2019 views","Latino","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Agarose gel electrophoresis of three diarrheic fecal samples yielded from the 25 samples desired amplicons that were 488 base pairs and sequencing substantiated that have BCoV. The sequence alignment indicated that nucleotide and amino acid sequences, the three TWD isolated in Thailand, were more quite homologous to each other (amino acid at position 39 of TWD1, TWD3 was proline, but TWD2 was serine) and closely related to OK-0514-3strain (virulent respiratory strain; RBCoV).The amino acid sequencing identities among TWD1, TWD2,TWD3, and OK-0514-3 strain were 96.0 to 96.6%, those at which T3I, H65N, D87G, H127Y, andQ136R were changed. In addition, the phylogenetic tree of the hypervariable region S1subunit spike glycoprotein BCoV gene was composed of three major clades by using the 54 sequences generated and showed that the evolutionally distance, TWD1, TWD2, and TWD3 were the isolated group together and most similar to OK-0514-3 strain (98.2 to 98.5% similarity).

Furthermore, we present a model and strategies that allow the government to reach the flattening of the power-law curves. We found that besides the social distancing of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate can help to flatten the power-laws.

Data Sources We retrieved review articles and original research from MEDLINE, OVID, and PubMed (1950-June 2009) that addressed our topic of interest, using the terms respiratory virus, asthma, IgE, atopy, and viral-induced wheeze. Study Selection Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma. Results Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic disease. We provide information from our mouse model that suggests that dendritic cells, IgE, and Fc\u025BRI are critical to the induction of atopy. Studies of patients taking antiviral agents (eg, ribavirin or palvizumab) support the notion that interfering with respiratory viral infections may decrease the development of atopy. Conclusions Many studies suggest strongly that viral infections may predispose patients to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases. Further, mechanistic studies are necessary to allow for the development of targeted therapeutics to prevent the translation of viral into atopic disease.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Amit; Grayson, Mitchell H.","journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma \u0026 Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1332cb1b4ba3b3ead4d99e2630da70ffb67f940.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120610601780; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120610601780; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1081-1206(10)60178-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral role","development of asthma","respiratory viral infections","translation of viral","Studies of patients","mechanistic studies","support","viral hypothesis of atopic disease","preexisting asthma","development of atopy","Epidemiologic studies","viral-induced wheeze","role of viruses","atopic diseases","terms respiratory virus","respiratory syncytial virus","IgE","Data Sources","development of targeted therapeutics","induction of atopy","review articles","Study Selection Articles","MEDLINE","theory","rhinovirus","original research","family size","dendritic cells","Fc\u025BRI","factors","surrogates","notion","antiviral agents","mouse model","OVID","ribavirin","relevance","large volume of literature","palvizumab","inflammatory cascade","information","PubMed","Objective","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Of the four Parainfluenza virus serotypes, Parainfluenza 4 is least well characterised from both the clinical, epidemiological and genetic perspectives. METHODS: Flocked nose or throat swabs from a previous study investigating viral prevalence in community-based adults suffering from influenza like illness were used as the basis for this study. Samples in which no virus was detected using a 16 viral respiratory pathogen real-time PCR panel were barcoded and pyrosequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. The sequences were analysed using the VirusHunter bioinformatic pipeline. Sanger sequencing was used to complete the detected Parainfluenza 4 coding region. RESULTS: A variant Parainfluenza 4 subtype b strain (QLD-01) was discovered in an otherwise healthy adult who presented with influenza like illness. Strain QLD-01 shared genomic similarities with both a and b subtypes. The extent of divergence of this genome from the 5 available whole Parainfluenza 4 genomes impacted the predicted binding efficiencies of the majority of published Parainfluenza 4 PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support a possible role for Parainfluenza 4 in the aetiology of adult respiratory disease within the community setting, and highlight the caution needed to be used in designing PCR assays from limited sequence information or in using proprietary commercial PCR assays.","publish_time":"2014-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; McVernon, Jodie; Nolan, Terry; Lambert, Stephen B; Zhao, Guoyan; Wang, David; Nissen, Michael D; Sloots, Theo P","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/594bdb5618d6e5e6abde1f955ab294362d7e4df8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4038074.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["Parainfluenza","PCR","Roche"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected Parainfluenza","variant Parainfluenza","Parainfluenza virus serotypes","majority of published Parainfluenza","Human Parainfluenza viruses","proprietary commercial PCR assays","viral respiratory pathogen real-time PCR panel","Strain QLD","illness","aetiology of adult respiratory disease","subtype b strain","viral prevalence","community setting","lower respiratory tract infections","previous study","healthy adult","b subtypes","community-based adults","throat swabs","common cause","limited sequence information","predicted binding efficiencies","genomes","shared genomic similarities","Flocked nose","Roche","GS FLX Titanium chemistry","METHODS","possible role","findings","genetic perspectives","children","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","coding region","VirusHunter bioinformatic pipeline","sequences","extent of divergence","caution","basis","Sanger sequencing","CONCLUSIONS","Samples"],"language":"en"},

We previously showed that transgenic mice that overexpress human ApoD show a better resistance against paraquat or OC43 coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we identified several nuclear factors from the cortex of control and OC43-infected mice which bind a fragment of the proximal ApoD promoter in vitro. Of interest, we detected apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Human ApoE consists of three isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) with the E4 and E2 alleles representing a greater and a lower risk for developping AD, respectively. Our results show that ApoE is located in the nucleus and on the ApoD promoter in human hepatic and glioblastoma cells lines. Furthermore, overexpression of ApoE3 and ApoE4 isoforms but not ApoE2 significantly inhibited the ApoD promoter activity in U87 cells (E3/E3 genotype) cultured under normal or different stress conditions while ApoE knock-down by siRNA had a converse effect. Consistent with these results, we also demonstrated by ChIP assay that E3 and E4 isoforms, but not E2, bind the ApoD promoter. Moreover, using the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization database, we observed an inverse correlation between ApoD and ApoE mRNA expression during development and in several regions of the mouse brain, notably in the cortex, hippocampus, plexus choroid, and cerebellum. This negative correlation was also observed for cortex layers IV\u2013VI based on a new Transcriptomic Atlas of the Mouse Neocortical Layers. These findings reveal a new function for ApoE by regulating ApoD gene expression.

Over the following 25 years, 14 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials produced widely differing results with about one-half showing success and the remainder showing failure. Positively charged, ionic zinc (iZn), but not bound zinc, is strongly astringent, antirhinoviral, increases interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) 10-fold, inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and inhibits the release of vasoactive ingredients from mast cell granules. Solution equilibrium chemistry analytical techniques showed lozenge iZn fraction varying from 0% to 100% of total lozenge zinc between trials, with zinc acetate (ZA) releasing 100% iZn, zinc gluconate (ZG) releasing 72% iZn and other zinc compounds releasing much less or none at physiologic pH 7.4. Since only iZn has in vitro benefits, iZn variations are hypothesized to have produced the widely varying clinical results. In support of the iZn hypothesis, lozenge iZn and total daily iZn in trials were found highly correlated with reductions in common cold durations with statistical significance for mean duration (P \u003C 0.001) and median duration (P \u003C 0.004), while total zinc (iZn plus bound) showed no correlation with changes in duration. Duration reductions (mean 0 days, median 0.43 days) for multi-ligand ZG and ZA lozenges differed significantly from duration reductions (mean 3.37 days, median 2.9 days) for single ligand ZA and ZG lozenges (P \u003C 0.001) showing that additive ligands as flavor-masks damaged or eliminated efficacy. Five of 6 trials with lozenges whose zinc compositions had a first stability constant of 1.7 or less succeeded, while only 2 of 9 trials of lozenges with higher stability succeeded (P \u003C 0.02). From the strong, multiple statistical relationships found, it is inferred that iZn is the active ingredient in zinc lozenges for colds, as it is in vitro against rhinoviruses, and that solution chemistry analytical techniques used at physiological pH are correct means for lozenge iZn analysis. Zinc lozenges slowly dissolving in the mouth over a 20\u201330 min period releasing adequate iZn (\u2A7E18 mg) used each 2 h are hypothesized to shorten common colds by 6\u20137 days, which is a cure for the common cold. Due to inadequate lozenge iZn very few of more than 40 different brands of zinc lozenges on the US market are expected to have any effect on the duration or severity of common colds.","publish_time":"2009-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eby, George A.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce92fe0c0c17b92962a9570197cae36bc43fed78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173295.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19906491/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987709006963; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987709006963; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2009.10.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iZn hypothesis","iZn variations","adequate iZn","total zinc","bound zinc","lozenge iZn fraction","lozenge iZn analysis","inadequate lozenge iZn","total lozenge zinc","trials of lozenges","zinc compositions","zinc acetate","ionic zinc","zinc compounds","total daily iZn","zinc gluconate throat lozenges","ZA lozenges","ZG lozenges","different brands of zinc lozenges","duration of common colds","days","median duration","Duration reductions","mean duration","severity of common colds","randomized clinical trials","common cold durations","solution chemistry analytical techniques","single ligand ZA","multi-ligand ZG","varying clinical results","Solution equilibrium chemistry analytical techniques","one-half showing success","statistical significance","physiological pH","differing results","stability constant","higher stability","physiologic pH","multiple statistical relationships","correct means","fold","flavor-masks damaged","placebo","release of vasoactive ingredients","mast cell granules","interferon-gamma","additive ligands","intercellular adhesion molecule","IFN-\u03B3","remainder","antirhinoviral","US market","correlation","day reduction","years","ICAM","efficacy","failure","effect","rhinoviruses","changes","support","cure","benefits","period","Eby","mouth"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, the majority of patients treated with AIs eventually develop resistance, inevitably resulting in patient relapse and, ultimately, death. The mechanism by which resistance occurs is still not completely known, however, recent studies suggest that impaired/defective interferon signaling might play a role. In the present study, we assessed the functional role of IFITM1 and PLSCR1; two well-known interferon response genes in AI resistance. METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to assess mRNA and protein levels of IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-7 in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on tissue microarrays consisting of normal breast tissues, primary breast tumors, and AI-resistant recurrence tumors. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular IFN\u03B1 level. Neutralizing antibody was used to block type 1 interferon receptor IFNAR1 signaling. Small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, IRF-7, and IFN\u03B1 expression. RESULTS: We found that IFITM1 and PLSCR1 were constitutively overexpressed in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-resistant tumors and that siRNA knockdown of IFITM1 significantly inhibited the ability of the resistant cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade. Interestingly, suppression of IFITM1 significantly enhanced estradiol-induced cell death in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells and markedly increased expression of p21, Bax, and Noxa in these cells. Significantly elevated level of IFN\u03B1 was detected in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells compared to parental MCF-7 cells and suppression of IFN\u03B1 dramatically reduced IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells. Lastly, neutralizing antibody against IFNAR1/2 and knockdown of STAT1/STAT2 completely suppressed IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells, thus confirming the involvement of the canonical IFN\u03B1 signaling pathway in driving the overexpression of IFITM1 and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the resistant cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of ISGs enhances the progression of AI-resistant breast cancer and that suppression of IFITM1 and other ISGs sensitizes AI-resistant cells to estrogen-induced cell death.

We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission.

METHODS: We compared electronically monitored facility-wide HH frequency in the weeks immediately prior to outbreaks of acute respiratory or gastrointestinal infections versus control weeks in a 137-bed pediatric LTCF from October 2012-August 2015. Control weeks were the 8-14 day (control 1) and 15-21 day (control 2) periods prior to the onset of each outbreak. RESULTS: There was no difference in HH frequency in the weeks leading up to the outbreaks versus control weeks (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 1 and OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings differed from those in adult LTFCs, possibly because of the greater contact between residents and staff in the pediatric setting, increased susceptibility to viral pathogens because of immunologic immaturity, or differences in the types of pathogens prevalent in each setting. Although HH may be important for limiting the number of residents infected during outbreaks, we found no association between HH frequency and subsequent outbreak onset.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Bevin; Murray, Meghan; Jia, Haomiao; Jackson, Olivia; Saiman, Lisa; Neu, Natalie; Hutcheon, Gordon; Larson, Elaine","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d14338dbc13d014f4066aa98c7e74673f3d58e5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7a14c9ee046c688ac5c625f6e62f15f188c3d9ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5135613.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655316306228; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2016.06.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655316306228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27566873/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5135613?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control weeks","pediatric LTCFs","pediatric setting","facility-wide HH frequency","epidemiology of viral pathogens","viral outbreak reduction","Studies","subsequent outbreak onset","day","outbreaks of acute respiratory","types of pathogens prevalent","bed pediatric LTCF","adult LTFCs","number of residents","confidence interval CI","adult long-term care facilities","increased susceptibility","differences","immunologic immaturity","staff","gastrointestinal infections","association","greater contact","hand hygiene","BACKGROUND","correlation","periods","odds ratio","findings","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The tissue localization of DPP4 in humans, bats, camelids, pigs, and rabbits generally correlates with MERS-CoV tropism, highlighting the role of DPP4 in virus pathogenesis and transmission. However, MERS-CoV S1(A) does not indiscriminately bind to all \u03B12,3-sialic acids, and the species-specific binding and tissue distribution of these sialic acids in different MERS-CoV-susceptible species have not been investigated. We established a novel method to detect these sialic acids on tissue sections of various organs of different susceptible species by using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1(A). We found that the nanoparticles specifically bound to the nasal epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes in human lungs, and the intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats. Desialylation by neuraminidase abolished nanoparticle binding and significantly reduced MERS-CoV infection in primary susceptible cells. In contrast, S1(A) nanoparticles did not bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species, nor did they bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Both pigs and rabbits have been shown to shed less infectious virus than dromedary camels and do not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes. Our results depict species-specific colocalization of MERS-CoV entry and attachment receptors, which may be relevant in the transmission and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV uses the S1(B) domain of its spike protein to attach to its host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The tissue localization of DPP4 has been mapped in different susceptible species. On the other hand, the S1(A) domain, the N-terminal domain of this spike protein, preferentially binds to several glycotopes of \u03B12,3-sialic acids, the attachment factor of MERS-CoV. Here we show, using a novel method, that the S1(A) domain specifically binds to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels, alveolar epithelium of humans, and intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats. In contrast, it does not bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs or rabbits, nor does it bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species. This finding supports the importance of the S1(A) domain in MERS-CoV infection and tropism, suggests its role in transmission, and highlights its potential use as a component of novel vaccine candidates.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widagdo, W.; Okba, Nisreen M.

Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment and mean 47% (\u00B116%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone. Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE. MSSPE is simple, low cost, fast and deployable on either benchtop or portable nanopore sequencers, making this method directly applicable for diagnostic laboratory and field use.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xianding; Achari, Asmeeta; Federman, Scot; Yu, Guixia; Somasekar, Sneha; B\u00E1rtolo, In\u00EAs; Yagi, Shigeo; Mbala-Kingebeni, Placide; Kapetshi, Jimmy; Ahuka-Mundeke, Steve; Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Ahmed, Asim A.; Ganesh, Vijay; Tamhankar, Manasi; Patterson, Jean L.; Ndembi, Nicaise; Mbanya, Dora; Kaptue, Lazare; McArthur, Carole; Mu\u00F1oz-Medina, Jos\u00E9 E.; Gonzalez-Bonilla, Cesar R.; L\u00F3pez, Susana; Arias, Carlos F.; Arevalo, Shaun; Miller, Steve; Stone, Mars; Busch, Michael; Hsieh, Kristina; Messenger, Sharon; Wadford, Debra A.; Rodgers, Mary; Cloherty, Gavin; Faria, Nuno R.; Th\u00E9z\u00E9, Julien; Pybus, Oliver G.; Neto, Zoraima; Morais, Joana; Taveira, Nuno; R.

The augmentation of the basis sets with diffuse functions showed a marked effect on the profile and barriers of the NO(2) torsional potential. Depending on the applied model chemistry, the heterocyclic ring in some 2-NPOs has proved to be non-planar. The non-planarity of the ring was characterized by Cremer\u2013Pople puckering amplitude Q. The disruption of the ring planarity in some NPOs was accounted for the distinctive reactivity and impact sensitivity of these heterocycles. Consistently, the NBO and the AIM analyses furnished clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of the C\u2013NO(2) bond and provided evidence for the electronic interplay between the NO(2) group, the fluorine substituent and the heterocyclic ring. Deletion of all off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR) to separate hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions from steric interactions was used. The effect of nitration and fluorination on the aromaticity of the studied 2-NPOs was investigated by using the NICS descriptors NICS(1) and NICS(1)(zz). These NICS indices have shown that the fluorination in para position to the nitro group exhibits the highest degree of aromaticity within the fluorinated 2-NPOs.

Wheezy illness has increasingly been recognised as an important cause of morbidity in African children, but there is little information on the contribution of HRV to this. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HRV as a cause of acute wheezing in South African children. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty children presenting consecutively at a tertiary children\u0027s hospital with a wheezing illness from May 2004 to November 2005 were prospectively enrolled. A nasal swab was taken and reverse transcription PCR used to screen the samples for HRV. The presence of human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus and human coronavirus-NL63 was assessed in all samples using PCR-based assays. A general shell vial culture using a pool of monoclonal antibodies was used to detect other common respiratory viruses on 26% of samples. Phylogenetic analysis to determine circulating HRV species was performed on a portion of HRV-positive samples. Categorical characteristics were analysed using Fisher\u0027s Exact test. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 128 (58.2%) of children, most (72%) of whom were under 2 years of age. Presenting symptoms between the HRV-positive and negative groups were similar. Most illness was managed with ambulatory therapy, but 45 (35%) were hospitalized for treatment and 3 (2%) were admitted to intensive care. There were no in-hospital deaths. All 3 species of HRV were detected with HRV-C being the most common (52%) followed by HRV-A (37%) and HRV-B (11%). Infection with other respiratory viruses occurred in 20/128 (16%) of HRV-positive children and in 26/92 (28%) of HRV-negative samples. CONCLUSION: HRV may be the commonest viral infection in young South African children with acute wheezing. Infection is associated with mild or moderate clinical disease.","publish_time":"2011-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smuts, Heidi E; Workman, Lesley J; Zar, Heather J","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c883fc2c4774529ce853012e339acf2aadc53454.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3065410.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21401965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-positive children","species of HRV","portion of HRV","contribution of HRV","role of HRV","HRV-C","HRV-B","HRV-negative samples","circulating HRV species","young children","positive samples","young South African children","wheezing illness","cause of acute wheezing","human bocavirus","human rhinoviruses","important triggers of wheezing","presence of human metapneumovirus","human coronavirus-NL63","common respiratory viruses","Wheezy illness","commonest viral infection","important cause of morbidity","negative groups","hospital deaths","reverse transcription PCR","tertiary children\u0027s hospital","PCR-based assays","HRVs","general shell vial culture","pool of monoclonal antibodies","little information","Infections","Phylogenetic analysis","Fisher\u0027s Exact test","Categorical characteristics","nasal swab","moderate clinical disease","BACKGROUND","study","ambulatory therapy","CONCLUSION","symptoms","years of age","intensive care","aim","METHODS","RESULTS","treatment"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: The 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date. Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks. This is due to Ebola\u0027s highly contagious nature and high mortality rate. RESULTS: When an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered. Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities. The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: General lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care.","publish_time":"2008-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, Ryan C.W.; Hall, Richard C.W.; Chapman, Marcia J.","journal":"Gen Hosp Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6372b5d19486a70ddbc4798e2140aa504526bc05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132410.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834308000777; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834308000777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18774428/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.05.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Democratic Republic","Congo"],"keyphrases":["Kikwit Ebola outbreak","staff","General lessons","general community","lethal viral epidemic","future viral outbreaks","intravenous medications","hesitance","natural disasters","beneficial psychological insight","patients","limited physical examinations","well-defined triage procedures","Democratic Republic","contagious nature","closure of supporting hospital facilities","importance","high mortality rate","bioterrorist attacks","modern hospitals","situations","Ebola\u0027s","biological crisis","unknowns","Congo","need","Changes","CONCLUSIONS","METHOD","basic practice of medicine","studied epidemics","date","sustained effort","care","Zaire","physicians","OBJECTIVE","article","fear","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4\u002B T cells from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), active TB and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay and four lncRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based approaches were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by the differentially expressed mRNAs. Results LncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4\u002B T cells were involved in LTBI and active TB disease. Compared with healthy controls, 449 lncRNAs and 461 mRNAs were deregulated in LTBI group, 1,113 lncRNAs and 1,490 mRNAs were deregulated in active TB group, as well as 163 lncRNAs and 187 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both LTBI and active TB group. It was worth noting that 41 lncRNAs and 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups. Most deregulated lncRNAs were from intergenic regions (\u223C50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (\u223C20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (\u223C10%). Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. Conclusions The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4\u002B T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection. Future studies are needed to further elucidate potential roles of these deregulated lncRNAs in LTBI and its reactivation.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Zhengjun; Li, Jianhua; Gao, Kunshan; Fu, Yurong","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa5a1e0edbabc717935a4ac5ec31857d4e5290b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975173/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445314001947; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445314001947; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2014.06.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene"],"organizations":["LTBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deregulated lncRNAs","deregulated mRNAs","Results LncRNAs","active TB group","latent TB infection","active TB disease","CD4","LTBI group","Methods Expression profiles of lncRNAs","T cells response","protein-coding loci","healthy controls","pathways","cytokine receptor interaction","non-coding RNAs","latent tuberculosis","mitogen-activated protein kinase","intronic antisense","host immune response","real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction","individuals","Genomes","MAPK","Toll","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","approaches","KEGG","validation","RT-qPCR","Conclusions","report","microarray assay","potential roles","biological functions","study","intergenic regions","reactivation","Gene ontology","Summary Objective","Future studies","groups"],"language":"en"},

However, only little is known about the humoral immune response against these viruses. Our aim was to establish virus-specific serological assays and to determine the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against these three viruses in the general population. METHODS: The capsid proteins VP1 of WUPyV and KIPyV and VP2 of HBoV were cloned into baculovirus vectors and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. IgG antibodies against WUPyV VP1, KIPyV VP1, and HBoV VP2 were determined by immunofluorescence assays in 100 plasma samples of blood donors. RESULTS: The median age of the blood donors was 31 years (range 20 - 66 yrs), 52% were male. 89% of the samples were positive for WUPyV IgG (median age 31 yrs, 49.4% male), 67% were positive for KIPyV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 46.3% male), and 76% were positive for HBoV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 51.3% male). For WUPyV and HBoV, there were no significant differences of the seropositivity rates with respect to age groups or gender. For KIPyV, the seropositivity rate increased significantly from 59% in the age group 20 - 29 years to 100% in the age group \u003E 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalences of antibodies against WUPyV, KIPyV, and HBoV were found in plasma samples of healthy adults.

These studies are part of a broad category termed two-phase studies. Common examples include the nested case-control and the case-cohort designs. For two-phase studies, appropriate weighted survival estimates have been derived; however, no estimator of cumulative incidence accounting for competing events has been proposed. This is relevant in the presence of multiple types of events, where estimation of event type specific quantities are needed for evaluating outcome. METHODS: We develop a non parametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function of events accounting for possible competing events. It handles a general sampling design by weights derived from the sampling probabilities. The variance is derived from the influence function of the subdistribution hazard. RESULTS: The proposed method shows good performance in simulations. It is applied to estimate the crude incidence of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in groups defined by a genotype not available for everyone in a cohort of nearly 2000 patients, where death due to toxicity acted as a competing event. In a second example the aim was to estimate engagement in care of a cohort of HIV patients in resource limited setting, where for some patients the outcome itself was missing due to lost to follow-up. A sampling based approach was used to identify outcome in a subsample of lost patients and to obtain a valid estimate of connection to care. CONCLUSIONS: A valid estimator for cumulative incidence of events accounting for competing risks under a general sampling design from an infinite target population is derived.","publish_time":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rebora, Paola; Antolini, Laura; Glidden, David V.; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia","journal":"BMC Med Res Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c3ebae910203c1f867fad1b2c14c555fc3e263c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4710022.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-015-0103-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26754746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcome","cumulative incidence of events accounting","cumulative incidence function of events accounting","possible competing events","estimator of cumulative incidence accounting","cohort of HIV patients","two-phase studies","general sampling design","competing risks","valid estimator","sampling probabilities","case-cohort designs","subsample of lost patients","crude incidence of relapse","presence of multiple types of events","parametric estimator","sampling based approach","care","valid estimate of connection","influence function","proposed method","nested case-control","estimation of event type specific quantities","childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia","groups","resource limited setting","appropriate weighted survival estimates","weights","infinite target population","good performance","simulations","engagement","broad category","toxicity","Common examples","aim","RESULTS","subdistribution hazard","genotype","CONCLUSIONS","variance","death","information","covariates","selected subsamples","METHODS","BACKGROUND","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

Since the re\u2010emergence of massive PEDV outbreaks in South Korea in 2013\u22122014, domestic pig farms have continued to experience PED epidemics or endemics. This study represents the molecular characterization of PEDV isolates identified in diarrhoeic animals collected across the country in 2017. Initial sequencing analysis of the full\u2010length S genes revealed that 70% of the 2017 isolates (7/10) belong to the G2b subgroup, while the remaining isolates were classified as G1b. The data indicated that both variant G1b and global epidemic G2b strains were responsible for current PED outbreaks in South Korea. The 2017 G1b and G2b isolates shared 98.7%\u201399.4% and 98.1%\u201399.2% amino acid sequence identity at the S gene level and 99.3% and 99.0%\u201399.6% nucleotide sequence homology at the genome level compared to the corresponding Korean prototype G1b and G2b strains, respectively. In an interesting manner, one G2b\u2010like KNU\u20101705 strain was found to possess a large 39\u2010nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a region theoretically encoding nonstructural protein 3. Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome and spike protein sequences indicated that the 2017 isolates were most closely related to other global G1b or G2b strains but formed different branches within the same genogroup. These results indicate that PEDVs undergo continuous evolution in the field. In addition, one 2017 PEDV strain, KOR/KNU\u20101705/2017, was successfully isolated and propagated in Vero cells. The antisera raised against the Korean prototype 2014 G2b strain efficiently neutralized KNU\u20101705 virus infection, suggesting antigenic homology between the 2014 and 2017 PEDV strains.

Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. Material and Methods This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. Results Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4\u002BT lymphocytes, CD8\u002BT lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR=7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P=0.027), eosinopenia (OR=5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P=0.049) and worse one-month outcome (OR=8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P=0.048). Conclusion Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Da-wei; Zhang, Dong; Tian, Run-hui; Li, Yang; Wang, Yu-shi; Cao, Jie; Tang, Ying; Zhang, Nan; Zan, Tao; Gao, Lan; Huang, Yan-zhu; Cui, Chang-lei; Wang, Dong-xuan; Zheng, Yang; Lv, Guo-yue","journal":"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a65832fca707c9fbadbf3eef04b75e9bab4a27a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120302242?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417210/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120302242","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients of severe type","severe COVID","patients of non-severe type","counts of lymphocytes","sentinel of COVID","underlying changes of PBICs","study group","discharged group","PBICs alterations","PBICs analysis","treatment","decreased counts of total T lymphocytes","control group","disease progression","eosinopenia","underlying changes of peripheral blood inflammatory cells","predictors of disease severity","disease-associated phases","increased counts of neutrophils","blood routine","NK cells","retrospective study","main cohort","secondary cohort","clinical classifications","risk factors","recovery phase","Conclusion Lymphopenia","aggravated phase","month outcomes","inflammatory cell levels","CD4","basophils","predicting role","cohorts","eosinophils","CD8","Abstract Background","Methods","Material","lymphocyte subsets","weeks","cellular immunity","Results","attention"],"language":"en"},

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, HAdV often is detected together with other virus species, even in healthy controls. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare molecular detection of HAdV with culture, and to examine the associations of various methods to RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from 4319 children admitted with RTI and from 361 controls. The NPAs were examined for 23 viral and bacterial pathogens, using inhouse real-time PCR-assays based on TaqMan probes, in addition to bacterial and viral culture. HAdV concentration was evaluated semi-quantitatively from the Ct-value and quantitatively by use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene\u00AE. Results HAdV-DNA was detected in 6.1% patient samples and in 10.5% controls (p\u003C 0.001). Compared to controls, patients had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.4\u201310.3) for mono-detection of HAdV DNA, and an OR of 5.1 (95% CI 2.0\u201313.4) for HAdV-positive samples grew adenovirus by culture. HAdV DNA loads from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct \u003C 30 and \u003E106 copies/ml) and one cluster with low viral loads, whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads (OR 7.8, 95% CI 2.2\u201327.1). In 61 available plasma samples, 16.4% were positive for HAdV DNA, all were from patients. Conclusion The detection of HAdV DNA per se by qualitative PCR is not useful as a diagnostic test. Detection of HAdV by use of viral culture and a high viral HAdV DNA load are the two methods most strongly associated with RTI in children.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schjelderup Nilsen, Hans-Johnny; Nordb\u00F8, Svein Arne; Krokstad, Sidsel; D\u00F8llner, Henrik; Christensen, Andreas","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae0e1cdeb2ba23048ccbeaf411b0834177e3860a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106418.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218303160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594701/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.12.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218303160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAdV DNA loads","detection of HAdV DNA","Results HAdV-DNA","HAdV concentration","high viral HAdV DNA load","molecular detection of HAdV","HAdV-positive samples","RTI","use of viral culture","high viral loads","low viral loads","children","healthy controls","double-stranded DNA virus","mono-detection","qualitative PCR","patient samples","patients","use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene","available plasma samples","inhouse real-time PCR-assays","bacterial pathogens","Abstract Background Human adenovirus","virus species","Ct-value","associations of various methods","Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates","respiratory tract infections","TaqMan probes","tests","addition","clusters","polymerase chain reaction","Conclusion","diagnostic test","Objectives","aim","copies","NPAs"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba Epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and BMAL1 in BMSCs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. ALP and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were also performed. Icariin promoted BMSC proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMAL1. In addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were upregulated by BMAL1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMAL1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. Finally, ARS staining of BMAL1(\u2212/\u2212) BMSCs revealed that BMAL1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMAL1-BMP2 signaling in BMSCs. The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Zengfa; Wei, Hui; Wang, Xiang; Xiao, Jianwei; Li, Zuoqin; Xie, Yuanliang; Hu, Yun; Li, Xiang; Wang, Zheng; Zhang, Shutong","journal":"Mol Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c4444ada7a386ec68c8180c998e0b2ec44824d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7002972.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32016461/; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2020.10954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cell Counting","ALP","Alizarin red S","OC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs","BMAL1-BMP2","BMAL1 deficiency","BMAL1 overexpression","sromotes osteogenic differentiation","osteogenic genes BMP2","ARS staining of BMAL1","upregulated expression of osteogenic genes","treatment of osteogenic disorders","ALP","osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","novel target of icariin","expression of brain","RUNX2","expression of bone morphogenetic protein","association","cell proliferation","present study","circadian clock genes","BMSC proliferation","RUNX family transcription factor","reverse transcription-quantitative PCR","potential applications","essential intermediary","matrix mineralization","Alizarin red S","osteocalcin","Herba Epimedii","western blotting","alkaline phosphatase","assay","muscle ARNT","aim","results","drugs","addition","Kit","research","conclusion","mechanism","toxicants"],"language":"en"},

The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch\u0027s postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, D.

BALB/c mice vaccinated with 5 or 10\u03BCg of rNTD protein demonstrated a significant humoral immune response (serum IgG and neutralizing activity). Additionally, according to the enzyme-linked immunospot, intracellular cytokine staining, and cytometric bead array assays, significant and functional T-cell immunity was induced by 10\u03BCg of the rNTD vaccination with aluminum and CpG adjuvant. Furthermore, rNTD-immunized mice showed reduced lung abnormalities in a MERS-CoV-challenge mouse model transfected with an adenoviral vector expressing human DPP4, showing protection consistent with that found with rRBD vaccination. These data show that rNTD induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and that it demonstrated protective capacity against a viral challenge, indicating that rNTD is a vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiaming, Lan; Yanfeng, Yao; Yao, Deng; Yawei, Hu; Linlin, Bao; Baoying, Huang; Jinghua, Yan; Gao, George F.; Chuan, Qin; Wenjie, Tan","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0c8e2e83670f588fa1673bb2234b520aa4f8242.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115548.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16311355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899228/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16311355; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.11.064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","rNTD vaccination","effective MERS-CoV vaccine","rNTD-immunized mice","\u03BCg of rNTD protein","spike protein of MERS","vaccine candidate","c mice","spike proteins","neutralizing activity","protective potential","viral challenge","protective capacity","rRBD vaccination","potent cellular immunity","challenge mouse model","receptor-binding domain","significant humoral immune response","antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies","functional T-cell immunity","recombinant N-terminal domain","persistent public health threat of infection","intracellular cytokine staining","cytometric bead array assays","serum IgG","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reduced lung abnormalities","adenoviral vector","human DPP4","protection consistent","aluminum","enzyme-linked immunospot","need","CpG adjuvant","immunogenicity","data","BALB","Previous studies"],"language":"en"},

The association of respiratory viruses in children with KD was investigated using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tissue Doppler echocardiography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 138 KD patients were included from January 2010 to June 2013. We compared 3 groups (group 1: n=94, KD without respiratory symptoms; group 2: n=44, KD with respiratory symptoms; and group 3: n=50, febrile patients with respiratory symptoms). Laboratory data were obtained from each patient including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic measurements were compared between group 1 and group 2. RT-PCR was performed using nasopharyngeal secretion to screen for the presence of 14 viruses in groups 2 and 3. RESULTS: The incidence of KD with respiratory symptoms was 31.8%. The duration of fever was significantly longer, and coronary artery diameter was larger in group 2 than in group 1. Tei index was significantly higher and coronary artery diameter larger in group 2 than group 1. Coronary artery diameter, C-reactive protein levels, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, and NT-pro BNP levels were significantly higher and albumin levels lower in group 2 compared with group 3. CONCLUSION: NT-pro BNP was a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating KD from other febrile viral respiratory infections. Some viruses were more frequently observed in KD patients than in febrile controls. Tei index using tissue Doppler imaging was increased in KD patients with respiratory symptoms.","publish_time":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Seul Bee; Choi, Han Seul; Son, Sejung; Hong, Young Mi","journal":"Korean Circ J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4776a30b2dc8da97b0c419d7577dd959231bbd61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4521110.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2015.45.4.317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory symptoms","KD patients","differentiating KD","incidence of KD","association of respiratory viruses","febrile patients","febrile viral respiratory infections","NT-pro BNP levels","coronary artery diameter larger","alanine aminotransferase levels","albumin levels lower","NT-proBNP","children","RT-PCR","febrile controls","Tei index","groups","C-reactive protein levels","tissue Doppler imaging","tissue Doppler echocardiography","N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide","platelet count","multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","valuable diagnostic tool","presence","nasopharyngeal secretion","Kawasaki disease","CONCLUSION","SUBJECTS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","acute phase","Laboratory data","RESULTS","Echocardiographic measurements","duration of fever"],"language":"en"},

However, at the time of initial presentation, most patients\u2019 viral status is unknown. Determination of factors that predict initial and subsequent need for intensive care (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are critical for resource planning and allocation. We describe our experience with 4,404 persons under investigation (PUI) and explore predictors of ICU care and IMV at a NY COVID-19 epicenter. Methods We conducted a retrospective COHORT of all persons under investigation (PUI) presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in NYS with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. The association between patient predictor variables and SARS-CoV-2 status, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality were explored with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Between March 12-April 14, 2020 we saw 4,404 PUI patients of whom 68% were discharged home, 29% were admitted to a regular floor and 3% to an ICU. 1,651 of 3,369 patients tested were SARS-CoV-2 positive to date. Of regular floor admits, 13% were subsequently upgraded to the ICU after a median (IQR) of 62 (28-106) hrs. 50 patients required IMV in the ED, 4 required prehospital IMV, and another 167 subsequently required IMV in a median (IQR) of 60 (26-99) hours after admission. Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and lower oxygen saturations were associated with need for ICU, IMV and death. High respiratory rates were associated with the need for ICU care. Conclusions PUI for COVID-19 contribute significantly to the healthcare burden beyond those ruling in for SARS-CoV-2. For every 100 admitted PUI, 9 will require ICU and/or IMV upon arrival and another 12 within 2-3 days of hospital admission, especially PUIs with lower oxygen saturations and positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs. This information should help hospitals stay ahead of the pandemic curve.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singer, Adam J.; Morley, Eric J.; Meyers, Kristen; Fernandes, Rafael; Rowe, Alison L.; Viccellio, Peter; Thode, Henry C.; Bracey, Alexander; Henry, Mark C.","journal":"Ann Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37cf11581ff8b69ec40900dc666d29d03bb979d8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019606442030353X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019606442030353X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["ICU","IMV","NY","NYS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive SARS-CoV","prehospital IMV","PUI patients","predictors of ICU care","positive patients","admitted PUI","Conclusions PUI","NY COVID","intensive care unit","lower oxygen saturations","invasive mechanical ventilation","subsequent need","investigation","symptoms suggestive of COVID","persons","median","IQR","regular floor","days of hospital admission","patients\u2019 viral status","time of initial presentation","PUIs","large academic medical center emergency department","NYS","patient predictor variables","reports","retrospective COHORT","association","resource planning","mortality","ABSTRACT Study objective","hospitals","allocation","Determination of factors","swabs","death","High respiratory rates","multivariate analyses","pandemic curve","Methods","epicenter","experience","date","arrival","healthcare burden","information","hours","Results"],"language":"en"},

Boars, as an important disseminator, shed PPV to sows via semen. PPV infects and numerously replicates in boar testicle, which results in damage of swine testicle in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mediator of cell apoptosis, play a crucial role in the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. However, whether PPV infection induces ST cells apoptosis and ROS accumulation is still unclear. METHODS: To determine the effects of PPV infection on the apoptosis, we detected morphological changes, DNA ladder, activities of caspases, and expression of PARP in PPV-infected ST cells. Moreover, aiming to investigate the effect of PPV infection on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and ROS accumulation, we detected the \u0394\u03C8m, apoptosis-related genes, and ROS. To investigate the role of ROS in the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the ST cells were infected with PPV and treated with the ROS antioxidants. The ROS level was measured using Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit and the \u0394\u03C8m, expression level of Bcl-2, translocation of Bax, and redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c were tested. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that PPV infection could induce apoptosis that was characterized by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspases. Moreover, PPV infection suppressed Bcl-2 expression, enhanced Bax expression and translocation to mitochondria, decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and triggered the release of cytochrome c, which caused the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and initiation of apoptosis. However, during the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of Fas and FasL were not affected. Further studies showed that PPV infection caused ROS accumulation. Inhibition of ROS could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and could significantly block ST cells apoptosis via suppressing Bax translocation, cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: All these results suggest that PPV-induced ROS accumulation mediates apoptosis in ST cells, which provided theoretical basis for the molecular pathogenesis of PPV infection.","publish_time":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaomin; Xiang, Hailing; Bai, Xiaoyuan; Fei, Naijiao; Huang, Yong; Song, Xiangjun; Zhang, Hongling; Zhang, Liang; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e3f518b27782ac9cc19e7556d74100ff23d972b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4755023.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880103/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0480-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPV","ST","ROS","Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["process of PPV","PPV-induced ROS accumulation","shed PPV","effects of PPV infection","effect of PPV infection","PPV-infected ST cells","ST cells apoptosis","induced apoptosis","molecular pathogenesis of PPV infection","ROS level","role of ROS","initiation of apoptosis","Inhibition of ROS","ROS antioxidants","mediator of cell apoptosis","apoptosis-related genes","results","translocation of Bax","Bax translocation","enhanced Bax expression","expression level of Bcl","expression of PARP","redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c","activation of caspases","mitochondria apoptotic pathway","mitochondrial apoptotic pathway","mitochondrial transmembrane potential","release of cytochrome c","subsequent activation of caspase","\u0394\u03C8m","morphological changes","damage of swine testicle","Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit","DNA ladder","DNA fragmentation","activities of caspases","crucial role","boar testicle","host cell death","reproductive failure of pregnant swine","theoretical basis","protein levels of Fas","important disseminator","Porcine parvovirus","FasL","BACKGROUND","study","studies","Boars","semen","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The influenza virus has different RNA segments, which can reassert to make new virus strain with the possibility to create an outbreak in unimmunized people. Gene reassortment is a process through which new strains are emerging in pigs, as it has specific receptors for both human influenza and avian influenza viruses. H1N1 binds specifically with an \u03B1-2,6 glycosidic bond, which is present in human respiratory tract cells as well as in pigs. Considering the fact of fast multiplication of viruses inside the living cells, rapid detection methods need an hour. Currently, WHO recommended methods for the detection of swine flu include real-time PCR in specific testing centres that take 3\u20134 h. More recently, a number of methods such as Antigen\u2013Antibody or RT-LAMP and DNA biosensors have also been developed that are rapid and more sensitive.

PROCEDURE: Medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at North Carolina State University\u0027s College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU\u2010CVM) or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, NC between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were cats that had complete diagnostic workups, including clinical, clinicopathological, serological, and histopathological data, as well as imaging modalities. Serology was consistently completed for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty cats met the inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of FeLV (2.7%), FIV (7.3%), FCoV (34.7%), T. gondii (23.7%), and Bartonella spp. (43.2%) was observed, with a combined seroprevalence of 59.2%. Nineteen cats (15.8%) were diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) based on clinical, hematological, serological, histopathological, and necropsy findings. The average age of all cases was 7.62 years, while the average age of cats diagnosed with FIP was 1.82 years. Neoplasia was diagnosed in six cats (5.0%). No underlying etiology was found in 49 cats (40.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Both idiopathic and neoplastic causes of uveitis were less prevalent than previously reported in studies, while seropositivity was higher than previously reported for the study area. This may be due to improved diagnostic capabilities or that cats with infectious disease were more likely to be referred. Because of the high prevalence of FIP, young cats with uveitis should be evaluated for hyperglobulinemia and FCoV serology should be performed as minimal diagnostics.","publish_time":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jinks, Maggie R.; English, Robert V.; Gilger, Brian C.","journal":"Vet Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39dd6a09bfbc61e303aa732acca3a0ff1a8a19ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559384/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Animal Eye Care Associates"],"locations":["North Carolina"],"keyphrases":["young cats","average age of cats","Medical records of cats","causes of endogenous uveitis","feline coronavirus","FCoV serology","feline immunodeficiency virus","neoplastic causes of uveitis","feline leukemia virus","feline infectious peritonitis","FIV","years","Inclusion criteria","Seroprevalence of FeLV","Bartonella","high prevalence of FIP","histopathological data","infectious disease","Toxoplasma gondii","combined seroprevalence","complete diagnostic workups","improved diagnostic capabilities","North Carolina State University\u0027s College of Veterinary Medicine","CVM","NCSU","Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary","clinicopathological","referral ophthalmology clinics","RESULTS","studies","CONCLUSIONS","necropsy findings","PROCEDURE","cases","hyperglobulinemia","imaging modalities","minimal diagnostics","seropositivity","underlying etiology","study area","OBJECTIVE","Neoplasia"],"language":"en"},

The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections.

Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease\u2013behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease\u2013behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years.","publish_time":"2015-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhen; Andrews, Michael A.; Wu, Zhi-Xi; Wang, Lin; Bauch, Chris T.","journal":"Phys Life Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50fa01990b8405f86066ae116511615d2ab3a01c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105224.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064515001372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2015.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26211717/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1571064515001372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","behavior dynamics","Human behavior","social dynamics","surprising behavior of disease","disease prevalence","coupled disease","complex networks","ways","social distancing","behavioral processes","statistical physics","field","growing literature","area","transmission of infection","growing sources of digital data","network-based approaches","key component of successful infection control efforts","policy makers","better design effective prevention strategies","two-way interaction","concepts","precautions","use of analysis methods","turn","real-world scenarios","spatial structure","nonlinear system","cases","population","researchers","predictions","coming years","pitfalls","models"],"language":"en"},

It shares the functionally conserved CD225 domain and multiple critical amino acid residues (Y19, F74, F77, R86 and Y98) with its human ortholog, which are essential for antiviral activity. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 significantly inhibited non-enveloped foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, sIFITM3 blocked FMDV infection at early steps in the virus life cycle by disrupting viral attachment to the host cell surface.

Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcome of respiratory viruses in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, include patients aged between 0 and 18 who fulfilled Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HAP. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. All included patients were monitored until discharge to collect data on the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. All-cause 30-day mortality was also ascertained. Results: Four thousand three hundred twenty-seven patients were followed for 42,658 patient-days and 5,150 ventilator-days. Eighty-eight patients (2.03%) met the CDC criteria for HAP, 63 patients were included, and clinical and epidemiological characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between patients with virus associated healthcare-associated pneumonia (VAHAP) and those with non-viral healthcare-associated pneumonia (NVHAP). At least one respiratory virus was detected in 65% [95% CI (53\u201377)] of episodes of HAP, with a single viral pathogen observed in 53.9% and coinfection with 2 viruses in 11.1% of cases. The outcome in terms of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and the 30-day mortality did not show a significant difference between groups. Conclusions: In two-thirds of the patients a respiratory virus was identified. There was no difference in mortality or the rest of the clinical outcome variables. About half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, which emphasizes the importance of considering these pathogens in nosocomial infections, since their identification can influence the decrease in hospital costs and be taken into account in infection control policies.","publish_time":"2019-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres-Garc\u00EDa, Margarita; P\u00E9rez M\u00E9ndez, Brenda Berenice; S\u00E1nchez Huerta, Jos\u00E9 Luis; Villa Guill\u00E9n, M\u00F3nica; Rementer\u00EDa Vazquez, Virydiana; Castro Diaz, Arturo Daniel; L\u00F3pez Martinez, Briceida; Laris Gonz\u00E1lez, Almudena; Jim\u00E9nez-Ju\u00E1rez, Rodolfo Norberto; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07177128e49e7d7440cebca1eb70294a3fc27cbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31157191/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention","CDC","HAP","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included patients","virus associated healthcare-associated pneumonia","clinical outcome of respiratory viruses","day mortality","Healthcare-associated infections","mechanical ventilation","non-viral healthcare-associated pneumonia","clinical data","clinical outcome variables","detection of respiratory viruses","episodes of HAP","CDC criteria","terms of ICU admission","significant differences","nosocomial infections","hospital costs","Diseases Control","All-cause","ventilator-days","patient-days","important cause of morbidity","single viral pathogen","infection control policies","intensive care unit","need","Prevention","VAHAP","account","rest","incidence","identification","epidemiological characteristics","discharge","thirds","NVHAP","prospective cohort study","common adverse events","nasopharyngeal swab specimen","pathogens","decrease","Centers","Introduction","half","importance","Methods","coinfection","groups","Conclusions","objective","cases","Results"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bovine SDP (BovSDP) in the pig diet on acute porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection. A total of 16 3-wk-old conventional crossbred pigs were used and divided into three groups. Treatments included 1) a negative control group fed a commercial diet and sham inoculated with commercial liquid porcine plasma (n = 3), 2) a positive control group fed a commercial diet and inoculated with PEDV-spiked porcine plasma (PEDV; n = 8), and 3) a third group of pigs fed the commercial diet with inclusion of 5% spray-dried bovine plasma and inoculated with PEDV-spiked porcine plasma (BovSDP; n = 5). Although clinical signs associated with PEDV infection were mild in the BovSDP group, two of eight pigs in the PEDV group developed moderate clinical disease and had to be euthanized. The PEDV IgG and IgA antibody levels and prevalence rates were significantly (P \u003C 0.05) higher in the PEDV\u2013BovSDP group compared with the PEDV group at 7 d postinoculation. The average fecal PEDV RNA shedding time was 7.2 \u00B1 1.0 d for the PEDV\u2013BovSDP group and 9.3 \u00B1 1.1 d for the PEDV group with an overall time to clearance of PEDV shedding of 11 d for PEDV\u2013BovSDP pigs and at least 14 d for PEDV pigs, which was not different (P = 0.215).

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high morbidity and mortality in piglets, is an enteropathogenic coronavirus with economic importance. Here, we demonstrated that both recombinant porcine IFN-L1 (rpIFN-L1) and rpIFN-L3 have powerful antiviral activity against PEDV infection of both Vero E6 cells and the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2). Both forms of rpIFN-L inhibited two genotypes of PEDV (strain CV777 of genotype 1 and strain LNCT2 of genotype 2). rpIFN-L1 primarily controlled viral infection in the early stage and had less antiviral activity in IPEC-J2 than in rpIFN-L3 cells infected with PEDV. In addition, rpIFN-L1 exhibited greater antiviral activity against PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells than that of porcine IFN-alpha. Consistent with this finding, rpIFN-L1 triggered higher levels of certain antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (ISG15, OASL, and MxA) in IPEC-J2 cells than porcine IFN-alpha. Although IPEC-J2 cells responded to both IFN-alpha and lambda, transcriptional profiling of ISGs (specifically ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITMs) differed when induced by either IFN-alpha or rpIFN-L. Therefore, our data provide the experimental evidence that porcine IFN-L suppresses PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells, which may offer a promising therapeutic for combating PED in piglets.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lin; Fu, Fang; Xue, Mei; Chen, Weiye; Liu, Jin; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Bu, Zhigao; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c051ae3e13770b683df8beca5ae92f808aa9f907.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28109912/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216302996; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.01.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216302996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPEC-J2 cells","rpIFN-L1","rpIFN-L3 cells","porcine IFN-alpha","PEDV infection of IPEC","recombinant porcine IFN-L1","forms of rpIFN","mucosal epithelial cells","genotypes of PEDV","robust antiviral activity","greater antiviral activity","powerful antiviral activity","Vero E6 cells","various types of cells","intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2","higher levels of certain antiviral IFN-stimulated genes","viral infection","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","ISG15","piglets","OASL","MxA","strain CV777 of genotype","strain LNCT2 of genotype","interferon lambda","mucosal surface","transcriptional profiling of ISGs","organs","interferons","early stage","enteropathogenic coronavirus","mortality","high morbidity","finding","data","experimental evidence","economic importance","addition","Abstract","contrast","IFITMs"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Infected wild-type and 4-1BB-knockout (KO) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, JEV-specific T cell, and type I/II IFN (IFN-I/II) innate responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway significantly increased resistance to JE and reduced viral burden in extraneural tissues and the CNS, rather than causing a detrimental effect. In addition, treatment with 4-1BB agonistic antibody exacerbated JE. Furthermore, JE amelioration and reduction of viral burden by blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway were associated with an increased frequency of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(\u002B) Th1 cells as well as increased infiltration of mature Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the inflamed CNS. More interestingly, DCs and macrophages derived from 4-1BB KO mice showed potent and rapid IFN-I innate immune responses upon JEV infection, which was coupled to strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7), and antiviral ISG genes (ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). Further, the ablation of 4-1BB signaling enhanced IFN-I innate responses in neuron cells, which likely regulated viral spread in the CNS. Finally, we confirmed that blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) played a dominant role in ameliorating JE. In support of this finding, HSC-derived leukocytes played a dominant role in generating the IFN-I innate responses in the host. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway ameliorates JE via divergent enhancement of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(\u002B) Th1 cells and mature Ly-6C(hi) monocyte infiltration, as well as an IFN-I innate response of myeloid-derived cells. Therefore, regulation of the 4-1BB signaling pathway with antibodies or inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of JE.","publish_time":"2015-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Seong Bum; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Han, Young Woo; Eo, Seong Kug","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/458c9e598bc8757d58a592739384d70ae4560a50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4657197.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0438-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JE","CNS","NK","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of JE","JE amelioration","ameliorating JE","pathway","BB-knockout","regulation of JE progression","derived cells","BB KO mice","rapid IFN","enhanced IFN","innate responses","zoonotic JE virus","murine JE model","Th1 cells","myeloid cells","increased frequency of IFN","BB agonistic antibody","neuron cells","divergent enhancement of IFN","reduction of viral burden","viral spread","hematopoietic stem cells","increased infiltration of mature Ly","immune responses","inflamed CNS","HSC-derived leukocytes","major cause of viral encephalitis","infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes","increased resistance","neuroinflammation","dominant role","monocyte infiltration","CD4","NK","addition","response of myeloid","JEV infection","therapeutic strategies","Japanese encephalitis","valuable therapeutic strategy","Infected wild-type","JEV-specific T cell","IRF7","immunomodulatory tools","inhibitors","antiviral ISG genes","increasing threat","MDA5","ISG49","ISG54","HSCs","extraneural tissues","RIG","global health","welfare","mortality","cytokine expression","finding","antibodies","strong induction of PRRs","transcription factors","clinical signs","ISG56","METHODS","monocytes","BACKGROUND","report","support","macrophages","detrimental effect","DCs","host","ablation","CONCLUSIONS","date","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA. This strategy was shown to successfully result in the specific generation of antibodies to the encoded information of the viral cDNA. Furthermore, this method has general applicability in the generation and characterization of antibodies directed against proteins encoded in cDNAs.","publish_time":"1989-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zoltick, Philip W.; Leibowitz, Julian L.; DeVries, James R.; Weinstock, George M.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7520dadc8662d0c0d1f3ef1c439d1a484d59e91.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111989904344; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0378111989904344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral protein","viral cDNA","viral recombinant vector","viral specificity","MHV-A59 polymerase proteins","MHV-A59 portion","tripartite protein","RecA protein","expression vector","expressed viral DNA","characterization of antibodies","recombinant proteins","fusion protein","prokaryotic vector","pGem vector","expression of cDNA","specific generation of antibodies","putative polymerase","pGE374","frame","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter","N terminus","C terminus","cat gene","novel method","encoded information","cell-free synthesis","active \u03B2-galactosidase","middle","coronaviral sequences","construct","general applicability","segment","infection","lacZ genes","antiserum","Rabbits","cDNAs","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Presently there are concerns whether the major initiatives that have boosted global health in the last 20 years will continue to grow and attract sufficient funding. But the more pertinent question is whether they are still suited to address the major concerns global health faces between now and 2030. In addition many of the global health challenges can only be addressed through actions in sectors other than health and by facing the inherently political nature of health as well as strong opposition from parts of the private sector. A well-financed and rules based governance system \u2014 adapted to complex multilateralism \u2014 is needed to manage, complement and integrate the many issue-based initiatives. The next era of global health will be judged by its political capacity to ensure global health security, build universal health coverage, address the commercial determinants of non-communicable diseases and reduce global health inequalities.

Serological screening was carried out on 303 samples from animals slaughtered between 2005 and 2008, and random-effect logistic regression models were developed for pathogens with a \u2018non-zero\u2019 prevalence. The apparent animal prevalence for PPV, PCV2, and L. intracellularis was 46.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41\u201352%), 51.1% (95% CI 45\u201357%) and 59.2% (95% CI 54\u201365%), respectively. Apparent farm seroprevalence rates for PPV, PCV2 and Lawsonia intracellularis were 56.3% (95% CI, 39\u201373%), 21.9% (95% CI, 8\u201336%) and 78.1% (95% CI, 64\u201392%), respectively. No antibodies were detected against SIV, ADV, CSFV, SVDV, TGEV, PRSSV, Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., or M. hyopneumoniae. Increasing herd size, proximity to dense populations of domestic swine and later sampling times within the survey period were found to be risk factors. Overall, the seroprevalence of these pathogens in farmed wild boar was similar to that in the farmed domestic pig population in Finland. However, it is possible that the rearing of wild boars in fenced estates may predispose them to particular infections, as reflected in higher antibody titres.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4lli, Outi; Ala-Kurikka, Eve; Nokireki, Tiina; Skrzypczak, Teresa; Raunio-Saarnisto, Mirja; Peltoniemi, Olli A.T.; Heinonen, Mari","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69eb669bc39469bb2b7c34b2e1a1e145510709e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110512.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023312001049; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516920/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023312001049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leptospira","M. hyopneumoniae"],"organizations":["SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine influenza virus","swine vesicular disease virus","PPV","PCV2","farmed wild boar","classical swine fever virus","Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus","porcine parvovirus","farmed European wild boars","Lawsonia intracellularis","respiratory syndrome virus","rearing of wild boars","dense populations of domestic swine","SVDV","CSFV","ADV","TGEV","porcine circovirus type","pathogens","SIV","Leptospira","Brucella","apparent animal prevalence","risk factors","national record of wild boar farmers","range of common porcine viral","farmed domestic pig population","bacterial infections","particular infections","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","Apparent farm seroprevalence rates","sampling frame","later sampling times","PRRSV","proximity","coronavirus","fenced estates","transmissible gastroenteritis","PRSSV","random-effect logistic regression models","survey period","herd size","Finland","higher antibody titres","study","non-zero","farms","samples","antibodies","confidence interval","Serological screening","animals","aim"],"language":"en"},

In the early 1980s, human insulin was prepared in recombinant bacteria and it is now used by all patients suffering from diabetes. Several other proteins and particularly human growth hormone are also prepared from bacteria. This success was limited by the fact that bacteria cannot synthesize complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies or coagulation blood factors which must be matured by post-translational modifications to be active or stable in vivo. These modifications include mainly folding, cleavage, subunit association, \u03B3-carboxylation and glycosylation. They can be fully achieved only in mammalian cells which can be cultured in fermentors at an industrial scale or used in living animals. Several transgenic animal species can produce recombinant proteins but presently two systems started being implemented. The first is milk from farm transgenic mammals which has been studied for 20 years and which allowed a protein, human antithrombin III, to receive the agreement from EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) to be put on the market in 2006. The second system is chicken egg white which recently became more attractive after essential improvement of the methods used to generate transgenic birds. Two monoclonal antibodies and human interferon-\u03B21a could be recovered from chicken egg white. A broad variety of recombinant proteins were produced experimentally by these systems and a few others. This includes monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, blood factors, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, milk proteins, collagen, fibrinogen and others. Although these tools have not yet been optimized and are still being improved, a new era in the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins was initiated in 1987 and became a reality in 2006. In the present review, the efficiency of the different animal systems to produce pharmaceutical proteins are described and compared to others including plants and micro-organisms.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Houdebine, Louis-Marie","journal":"Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c523ce14e004c183127e99f57098bb122aa8ccb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112688.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957107001300; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957107001300; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2007.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMEA (European Agency","Medicinal Products"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["milk proteins","complex proteins","Abstract Proteins","production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins","broad variety of recombinant proteins","recombinant bacteria","monoclonal antibodies","human insulin","growth factors","human antithrombin","human growth hormone","coagulation blood factors","human interferon-\u03B21a","different animal systems","transgenic animal species","chicken egg white","transgenic birds","farm transgenic mammals","post-translational modifications","hormones","enzymes","cytokines","European Agency","methods","efficiency","vaccines","\u03B3-carboxylation","subunit association","industrial scale","agreement","Evaluation of Medicinal Products","EMEA","cleavage","collagen","pharmaceuticals","new era","fermentors","living animals","essential improvement","glycosylation","pig pancreas","fibrinogen","present review","mammalian cells","patients","diabetes","plants","micro-organisms","years","success","market","tools","reality"],"language":"en"},

Hence, there is an urgency to understand the response mechanisms of marine organisms to adverse environment. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes, their roles in stress responses still remain unclear. Here, differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified as responses to environmental stresses in the economically important sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, and their potential roles were explored. Based on a total of 159, 355 and 495 significantly upregulated genes and 230, 518 and 647 significantly downregulated genes identified in the thermal, hypoxic and combination thermal \u002B hypoxic stress treatments, respectively, we constructed DE-lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks. Among the networks, eight shared pairs were identified from the three treatments, and based on the connectivity degree, MSTRG.27265, MSTRG.19729 and MSTRG.95524 were shown to be crucial lncRNAs. Among all the significantly changed lncRNAs identified by RT-qPCR and sequencing data, binding sites were found in four other lncRNAs (MSTRG.34610, MSTRG.10941, MSTRG.81281 and MSTRG.93731) with Aja-miR-2013-3p, a key miRNA that responds to hypoxia in sea cucumbers. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03B1) was also shown as the possible targeted mRNA of Aja-miR-2013-3p. As indicated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system, \u201CHIF-1\u03B1 gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.34610\u201D network and the \u201CHIF-1\u03B1 gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.10941\u201D network may play important roles in sea cucumbers under environmental stresses. Moreover, environmental stress altered the expression of multiple lncRNAs and mRNAs, thus affecting various biological processes in A. japonicus, including immunity, energy metabolism and the cell cycle. At the molecular level, more comprehensive responses were elicited by the combined thermal/hypoxic stress treatment than by individual stresses alone in sea cucumbers. This study lays the groundwork for future research on molecular mechanisms of echinoderm responses to thermal and hypoxic stress in the context of global climate changes.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huo, Da; Sun, Lina; Storey, Kenneth B.; Zhang, Libin; Liu, Shilin; Sun, Jingchun; Yang, Hongsheng","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/308b85a5c3d4cad71564cb5f7612c515f393af9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144348.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969719360413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31905562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719360413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSTRG","stress responses","hypoxic stresses","hypoxic stress treatments","Aja-miR","environmental stresses","sea cucumbers","crucial lncRNAs","combined thermal","combination thermal","HIF","expression of multiple lncRNAs","important roles","comprehensive responses","individual stresses","\u03B1 gene","important sea cucumber","molecular mechanisms of echinoderm responses","mRNAs","potential roles","possible targeted mRNA of Aja","various biological processes","Apostichopus japonicus","molecular level","adverse environment","global warming","downregulated genes","aquatic environment","upregulated genes","DE-lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks","hypoxia-inducible factor","response mechanisms of marine organisms","context of global climate changes","future research","sequencing data","energy metabolism","dual-luciferase reporter assay system","immunity","groundwork","RT-qPCR","binding sites","cell cycle","key miRNA","study","non-coding RNAs","connectivity degree","shared pairs","urgency","total"],"language":"en"},

Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an essential virulence factor of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and of the apoptosis associated with the pathogenesis of H5N1. Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein is able to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. However, it remains unclear whether the intrinsic pathway is also associated with this apoptosis. The present study used a clone of the NS1 gene from avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 and observed the localization of the NS1 protein and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was detected using an MTT assay and the number of apoptotic cells was counted using a flow cytometer. Following the isolation of mitochondria, western blotting was performed to compare cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in cells before and after apoptosis. The change of MMP was detected using JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the results reveal that the majority of the NS1 protein was localized in the cell nucleus, and that it may induce apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells. The apoptosis occurred with marked cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a change of the MMP. This indicated that the NS1 protein may be associated with apoptosis induced by an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.","publish_time":"2017-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bian, Qian; Lu, Jing; Zhang, Li; Chi, Ying; Li, Yan; Guo, Hongxiong","journal":"Exp Ther Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/854545208a6bc7cafa8744604899e32237ff2047.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5647739.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2017.5056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS1 protein","NS1 gene","change of MMP","apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells","Non-structural protein","marked cytochrome c release","isolation of mitochondria","intrinsic pathway","pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus","Outbreaks of avian influenza","lung cancer cells","intrinsic mitochondrial pathway","pathogenesis of H5N1","number of apoptotic cells","extrinsic pathway","change of mitochondrial membrane potential","virus infection","significant health","clone","essential virulence factor","economic consequences","MTT assay","western blotting","Jiangsu","localization","JC","majority","present study","flow cytometer","cell nucleus","Previous studies","Cytotoxicity","staining","results"],"language":"en"},

These projects have played an important role by complementing national efforts in the fight against HIV/AIDS in China. Methods The diverse characteristics of these projects followed three phases over 20 years. Initially, stand-alone projects provided technical support in surveillance, training or advocacy for public awareness. As the epidemic spread across China, projects became a part of the comprehensive and integrated national response. Currently, international best practices encourage the inclusion of civil society and non-governmental organizations in an expanded response to the epidemic. Results Funding from international projects has accounted for one-third of the resources provided for the HIV/AIDS response in China. Beyond this strong financial support, these programmes have introduced best practices, accelerated the introduction of AIDS policies, strengthened capacity, improved the development of grassroots social organizations and established a platform for communication and experience sharing with the international community. However, there are still challenges ahead, including integrating existing resources and exploring new programme models. The National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS) in China is consolidating all international projects into national HIV prevention, treatment and care activities. Conclusion International cooperation projects have been an invaluable component of China\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS, and China has now been able to take this information and share its experiences with other countries with the help of these same international programmes.","publish_time":"2010-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Jiangping; Liu, Hui; Li, Hui; Wang, Liqiu; Guo, Haoyan; Shan, Duo; Bulterys, Marc; Korhonen, Christine; Hao, Yang; Ren, Minghui","journal":"Int J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14c6f99cf0ec54c78447ad5a8403e3ee2708176f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2992613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21113032/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion International"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["international projects","international organizations","AIDS response","international programmes","Conclusion International cooperation projects","stand-alone projects","AIDS epidemic","international community","international best practices","national HIV prevention","integrated national response","introduction of AIDS policies","national efforts","National Centre","expanded response","epidemic spread","years","invaluable component of China\u2019s response","non-governmental organizations","technical support","development of grassroots social organizations","existing resources","strong financial support","surveillance","inclusion of civil society","training","STD Control","treatment","advocacy","platform","capacity","fight","care activities","new programme models","NCAIDS","help","communication","important role","public awareness","diverse characteristics","experiences","Methods","phases","Results Funding","USD","information","countries","Background"],"language":"en"},

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides and branched fucosylated structures. It is now clear that the biological role of DC-SIGN is two-fold. It is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and mediates important functions necessary for the induction of successful immune responses that are essential for the clearance of microbial infections, such as the capture, destruction, and presentation of microbial pathogens to induce successful immune responses. Yet, on the other hand, pathogens may also exploit DC-SIGN to modulate DC functioning thereby skewing the immune response and promoting their own survival. This chapter presents an overview of the structure of DC-SIGN and its expression pattern among immune cells. The current state of knowledge of DC-SIGN-carbohydrate interactions is discussed and how these interactions influence dendritic cell functioning is examined. The molecular aspects that underlie the selectivity of DC-SIGN for mannose-and fucose-containing carbohydrates are detailed. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the role of DC-SIGN in dendritic cell biology and how certain bacterial pathogens exploit DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geurtsen, Jeroen; Driessen, Nicole N.; Appelmelk, Ben J.","journal":"Microbial Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c12d9e98eeda8568eab644122b1ecdfeeb5cfbd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150001.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123745460000341; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123745460000341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC-SIGN","DC functioning","selectivity of DC","structure of DC","biological role of DC","immune cells","dendritic cell functioning","dendritic cells","immune surveillance","dendritic cell biology","induction of successful immune responses","presentation of microbial pathogens","chapter","Publisher Summary Dendritic cell-specific ICAM","certain bacterial pathogens","carbohydrate interactions","high-mannose oligosaccharides","clearance of microbial infections","important functions necessary","C-type lectin receptor","expression pattern","capture","destruction","current state of knowledge","nonintegrin","fucosylated structures","fucose","overview","molecular aspects","carbohydrates","survival","hand","fold"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Sera albumin, Evans blue, and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1-week-old C57BL/6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein. VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer, an in vitro BBB model. Tight junction protein claudin-5 was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1. In contrast, VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin, which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody. Vimentin expression in the VP1-treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF-\u03B2/Smad-3 and NF-\u03BAB signal pathways. Moreover, vimentin over-expression was accompanied with compromised BBB. From these studies, we conclude that EV-A71 virus capsid protein VP1 disrupted BBB and increased virus receptor vimentin, which both may contribute to the virus entrance into brain and EV-A71 CNS infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wenjing; Sun, Jiandong; Wang, Nan; Sun, Zhixiao; Ma, Qiyun; Li, Jun; Zhang, Mingshun; Xu, Juan","journal":"J Neurovirol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a89d01436c87dbd802431eb574ed0dd486d4d6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7040057.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-019-00800-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera","Evans"],"organizations":["BBB","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV-A71 virus capsid protein VP1","EV-A71 capsid protein VP1","roles of VP1","VP1-treated brain endothelial cells","VP1 recombinant protein","brain parenchyma","brain barrier","brain tissues","VP1 neutralization antibody","brain endothelial cells monolayer","expression of virus receptor vimentin","increased virus receptor vimentin","Vimentin expression","virus attachment","virus entrance","EV-A71 CNS infection","Enterovirus A71","EV-A71pathogenesis","vimentin over-expression","compromised BBB","BBB model","Tight junction protein claudin","permeability of blood","mouth diseases","nervous system diseases","J mice","important virulence factor","major cause of severe hand-foot","encephalitis","dextran","Evans blue","week-old C57BL","TGF-\u03B2","Smad","NF-\u03BAB signal pathways","Sera albumin","HFMD","contrast","study","studies"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence and clinical characteristics of hMPV were determined in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children in Changsha, China. Reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 1,165 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to August 2008. All PCR products were sequenced, and demographic and clinical data were collected from all patients. Seventy\u2010six of 1,165 (6.5%) specimens were positive for hMPV, of which 85.5% (65/76) occurred in the winter and spring seasons. The hMPV coinfection rate was 57.9% (44/76), and human bocavirus was the most common virus detected in conjunction with hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 94.7% of the hMPV detected were of subgroup A2, 5.3% were subgroup B2, and none belonged to either the A1 or B1 subgroups.

METHOD: From January 2013 to December 2017, children admitted with respiratory tract infection at the Department of Pediatrics in Chung\u2010Ang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from patients and tested for hPIV types by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We retrospectively reviewed subject medical records, focusing on epidemiological and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 12 423 NPA specimens, 8,406 were positive by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine respiratory viruses, and 1,018 were positive for one of the four types of hPIV: 1,018 specimens led to the detection of 1,029 hPIVs; 3ss (31.3%) were positive for hPIV1, 120 (11.7%) were positive for hPIV2, 356 (34.6%) were positive for hPIV3, and 231 (22.4%) were positive for hPIV4. Of the hPIV\u2010positive patients, the mean age was 2.3 years (range, 0.1\u201312.7 years), 225 (97.4%) had no underlying disease, and 178 (77.1%) had a fever with a duration of 4.1 \u00B1 2.3 days and a peak temperature of 39.0 \u00B1 0.7 \u2103. The most common diagnosis in hPIV4 infection was pneumonia (44.2%), followed by bronchiolitis (26.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (24.3%). Only 2.2% of patients were diagnosed with croup. Although the most prevalent overall type of hPIV was hPIV3, hPIV4 generally caused acute respiratory tract infection in summer and early fall in an irregular annual pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Human parainfluenza virus type 4 is an important common pathogen of respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients in Korea.","publish_time":"2020-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Young E.; Park, Ji Y.; Lee, Mi K.; Lim, In S.","journal":"Pediatr Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b19dfcb9191e3cad442366cefc8b66f59456348.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31705838/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chung\u2010Ang University Hospital"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["positive patients","hPIV4 infection","characteristics of hPIV4","acute respiratory tract infection","upper respiratory tract infection","respiratory viruses","hPIV types","types of hPIV","pediatric patients","characteristics of human parainfluenza virus type","important common pathogen of respiratory tract infections","prevalent overall type of hPIV","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","hPIV3","clinical characteristics","NPA specimens","Korea","years","Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens","common diagnosis","early fall","summer","Department of Pediatrics","mean age","Ang University Hospital","Chung","irregular annual pattern","range","CONCLUSIONS","pneumonia","subject medical records","days","detection","ss","BACKGROUND","children","duration","peak temperature","hPIVs","study","RESULTS","underlying disease","fever","bronchiolitis","croup","hPIV1","hPIV2","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

Both are composed of a closed membrane, which is lined with coat proteins and encases cargo. Transmembrane proteins inserted into the membrane define the target membrane area with which the vesicle or virus is destined to fuse. Here we discuss recent insight into the functioning of enveloped viruses in the framework of the \u201Cfunctional module\u201D concept. Vesicular transport is an exemplary case of a functional module, as defined as a part of the proteome that assembles to perform a specific autonomous function in a living cell. Cellular vesicles serve to transport cargo between membranous organelles inside the cell, while enveloped viruses can be seen as carriers of the viral genome delivering their cargo from an infected to an uninfected cell. The turnover of both vesicles and viruses involves an analogous series of submodular events. This comprises assembly of elements, budding from the donor compartment, uncoating and/or maturation, docking to and finally fusion with the target membrane to release the cargo. This modular perception enables us to define submodular building blocks so that mechanisms and elements can be directly compared. It will be analyzed where viruses have developed their own specific strategy, where they share functional schemes with vesicles, and also where they even have \u201Chijacked\u201D complete submodular schemes from the cell. Such a perspective may also include new and more specific approaches to pharmacological interference with virus function, which could avoid some of the most severe side effects.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thaa, Bastian; Hofmann, Klaus Peter; Veit, Michael","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64f741f97bb3f597b1ada7ce3eaecdc0be546578.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114299.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488910000121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488910000121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100522/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transport cargo","cellular transport vesicles","Cellular vesicles","functioning of enveloped viruses","Abstract Enveloped viruses","functional schemes","functional module","functional properties","living cell","uninfected cell","closed membrane","target membrane area","specific approaches","Vesicular transport","specific strategy","specific autonomous function","complete submodular schemes","virus function","submodular building blocks","analogous series of submodular events","assembly of elements","coat proteins","Transmembrane proteins","pharmacological interference","exemplary case","framework","membranous organelles","mechanisms","carriers","donor compartment","viral genome","recent insight","uncoating","maturation","modular perception","concept","turnover","effects","perspective","proteome"],"language":"en"},

A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, further developed by NewLink Genetics Corp. and Merck \u0026 Co., and is now in final stages of registration by Merck. The vaccine is attenuated by deletion of the principal virulence factor of VSV (the G protein), which also removes the primary target for anti-vector immunity. The V920 vaccine caused no toxicities after intramuscular (IM) or intracranial injection of nonhuman primates and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in a rat model. In multiple studies, cynomolgus macaques immunized IM with a wide range of virus doses rapidly developed ZEBOV-specific antibodies measured in IgG ELISA and neutralization assays and were fully protected against lethal challenge with ZEBOV virus. Over 20,000 people have received the vaccine in clinical trials; the vaccine has proven to be safe and well tolerated. During the first few days after vaccination, many vaccinees experience a mild acute-phase reaction with fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia of short duration; this period is associated with a low-level viremia, activation of anti-viral genes, and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines. Oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence, and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited. V920 vaccine was used in a Phase III efficacy trial during the West African Ebola epidemic in 2015, showing 100% protection against Ebola Virus Disease, and it has subsequently been deployed for emergency control of Ebola outbreaks in central Africa. The template provided here provides a comprehensive picture of the first rVSV vector to reach the final stage of development and to provide a solution to control of an alarming human disease.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monath, Thomas P.; Fast, Patricia E.; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Clarke, David K.; Martin, Brian K.; Fusco, Joan; Nichols, Richard; Heppner, D.

It is a powerful antiviral strategy that has been widely employed to protect hosts from viral infection. Hepatitis E (HE) is an acute fulminant hepatitis in adults that has particularly high mortality in pregnant women. At this point in time, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment that is effective against the infectious agent, HEV. The nonstructural polyprotein region possesses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. RdRp is therefore regarded as one of the most attractive candidates for RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, the high efficiency and specificity of siRNA were evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays. Protective effects against HEV infection were achieved in A549 cells and in piglets. In piglets treated with a shRNA-RdRp-1 expression plasmid prior to HEV inoculation, HEV antigens were significantly reduced in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were clearly decreased. These results suggested that RNAi is a potentially effective antiviral strategy against HEV replication and infection.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Fen; Hua, Xiuguo; Yang, Shixing; Yuan, Congli; Zhang, Wen","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa02a3f41850de40403ef867e2c83ba488836011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114333.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209003775; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19576249/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209003775","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEV infection","HEV replication","HEV antigens","HEV inoculation","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNAi","Abstract RNA interference","viral RNA genome","viral infection","effective antiviral strategy","antiviral treatment","shRNA-RdRp","powerful antiviral strategy","piglets","expression plasmid","aspartate aminotransferase","high efficiency","high mortality","Hepatitis E","silencing expression of aberrant","activities of alanine aminotransferase","acute fulminant hepatitis","Real-Time quantitative PCR","AST","ALT","specificity of siRNA","Western blot assays","adults","total bilirubin","natural mechanism","kidneys","foreign genes","vaccine","nonstructural polyprotein region","A549 cells","attractive candidates","present study","infectious agent","liver","TBIL","pregnant women","Protective effects","spleen","hosts","point","results"],"language":"en"},

H7 hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in influenza entry and thus HA presents an attractive target for antivirals. Previous studies have suggested that the small molecule tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) inhibits the entry of influenza H3 HA by binding to the stem loop of HA and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation of HA, thereby disrupting the membrane fusion step. Based on amino acid sequence, structure and immunogenicity, H7 is a related Group 2 HA. In this work we show, using a pseudovirus entry assay, that TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry, as well as H3 HA-mediated entry, with an IC50\u223C6 \u00B5M. Using NMR, we show that TBHQ binds to the H7 stem loop region. STD NMR experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of TBHQ makes extensive contact with the H7 HA surface. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that TBHQ inhibits influenza entry by stabilizing the H7 HA neutral pH conformation. Together, this work suggests that the stem loop region of H7 HA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and that TBHQ, which is a widely used food preservative, is a promising lead compound.","publish_time":"2013-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antanasijevic, Aleksandar; Cheng, Han; Wardrop, Duncan J.; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e3a5143a77a6faeb480c65a23137616c14e7bad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3806803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","TBHQ"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H7 HA-mediated entry","H7 HA surface","entry of influenza H3 HA","stem loop of HA","H3 HA-mediated entry","stem loop region of H7 HA","influenza entry","H7 HA neutral pH conformation","neutral pH conformation of HA","H7 hemagglutinin","H7 stem loop region","aromatic ring of TBHQ","pseudovirus entry assay","attractive target","work","recent outbreak of H7N9 influenza","STD NMR experiments","Limited proteolysis experiments","China","immunogenicity","extensive contact","binding","small molecule tert-butyl hydroquinone","high concern","structure","critical role","amino acid sequence","therapeutic intervention","related Group","promising lead compound","food preservative","public health","IC50","antivirals","membrane fusion step","Previous studies","\u00B5M"],"language":"en"},

Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex.

The available literature demonstrates that classifiable members of the genus Ranavirus enter cells via multiple and complicated routes. Here, we demonstrated the underlying cellular entry mechanism of soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) using green fluorescence tagged recombinant virus. Treatment with chlorpromazine, sucrose, ethyl-isopropyl amiloride, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 all significantly decreased STIV infection, suggesting that STIV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis to enter cells via a pH-dependent pathway. Depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin significantly inhibited STIV entry, but neither filipin III nor nystatin did, suggesting that STIV entry was cholesterol dependent but caveola independent. Treatment with dynasore, genistein, ML-7 or cytochalasin D all significantly inhibited STIV infection, indicating that Rac GTPase and myosin II activity were required for the macropinocytosis-like pathway as well as actin polymerization.

All too often in such times, scant attention is paid to what\u2019s between the top line and the bottom line of the income statement. Worse, most business owners, in my experience, give little more than a cursory nod to the balance sheet. Why does this matter? When a recession lands on their doorstep with a sudden thud, as it apparently just has, many of these same people will find themselves having sailed too close to the wind, with cash running out and a dearth of tools to help them weather the storm and understand what has gone wrong. But it need not be so, for there are four simple tools to help any business owner answer these four important questions: (1) Where is cash going in my business, and where is it coming from? (2) To what extent are my profit margins improving or declining, and why? (3) To what extent am I effectively managing the cash-flow relationships with my customers and my suppliers? (4) What, if anything, can I do to better manage the cash that flows into and out of my business?

However, this bioactivity mechanism is not much known. Here, the role of sialic acid in OVM anti-virus activity has been studied by ELISA with lectin or ligand. Structural changes of OVM after removing sialic acid were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. OVM could be binding to the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza viruses H(5)N(1) and H(1)N(1), this binding was specific and required the involvement of sialic acid. When sialic acid was removed, the binding was significantly reduced 71.5% and 64.35%, respectively. Therefore, sialic acid was proved as a recognition site which avian influenza virus bound to. Meanwhile, the endogenous fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity of OVM removing sialic acid were increased and the secondary structure tended to shift to random coil. This indicated that OVM molecules were in an unfolded state and spatial conformation disorder raising weakly. Remarkably, free sialic acid strongly promoted OVM binding to HA and thereby enhanced the interaction. It may contribute to the inhibition of host cell infection, agglutinate viruses.

In neonates, the infection is non-viremic, have very short incubation period, and manifests profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration. Concurrent infection with secondary pathogens may augment the disease severity. Diarrhea occurs due to virus-mediated destruction of absorption efficient enterocytes, activation of enteric nervous system, or due to a rotavirus enterotoxin. Diagnosis of the infection relies on conventional techniques like isolation in MA 104 cell lines, electron microscopy, electro-pherotyping, and various serological tests. Presently, diagnosis and molecular typing is performed using serotype specific RT-PCR, sequencing or genomic hybridization techniques. As the rotaviruses are known to exhibit extreme genetic diversity and outplay disinfection procedures, eradication of the pathogen is often difficult. Hence, for prevention, good management practices coupled with vaccination of dam for protecting young ones, has to be practiced. Recently, new generation prophylactic strategies including DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs) and edible vaccines have been found to induce sufficient levels of passive immunity. Aside to the infection in animals, zoonotic significance of the animal rotaviruses has to be further unearthed. In this review, efforts have been made to highlight the importance and prevalence of the disease in bovines, its pathogenesis along with preventive measures, salient features of rotaviruses and their inter-species transmission abilities, zoonotic implications, and a concise account of the infection in various domestic animals and poultry.","publish_time":"2008-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhama, K.; Chauhan, R.

Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical.

A 33.5 kilobase (kb) nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is in the 100\u2013300 kb range. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps towards DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of the size constraints on RNP entities and the role of genome size in virus adaptation. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20\u201334 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with the acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in a monophyletic subset of nidoviruses. However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region including unannotated domains, and overall 41.1-kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, as well as key replicative domains. These domains may include functionally relevant substitutions rarely or never before observed in highly conserved sites of RdRp, NiRAN, ExoN and 3CLpro. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts, e.g. Ankyrin and Fibronectin type II, which might modulate virus-host interactions. PSCNV\u0027s greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features\u2013impressive in themselves\u2013attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.","publish_time":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saberi, Amir; Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.; Brubacher, John L.; Newmark, Phillip A.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/845b2c4662c9d7db919b0f257acecf15d97dfc81.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bfcd50d713b8f61b51563ec3abc1afcedf01f931.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6211748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383829/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSCNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA genome size","role of genome size","larger RNA genomes","known RNA genomes","size of ORF1b","viral RNA genomes","studies of larger RNA viruses","known RNA-protein","RNP entities","size constraints","minimal cellular DNA genome","contemporary DNA-RNP","typical of large DNA viruses","large ORF1b","DNA-based life","upper size limit","primordial RNP","canonical nidoviral genome organization","key replicative domains","novel nidovirus","ExoN","multi-ORF nidoviruses","large difference","unannotated domains","monophyletic subset of nidoviruses","positive-stranded nidoviruses","virus-host interactions","key replicative enzymes","entities capable of autonomous replication","planarian secretory cell nidovirus","virus adaptation","apparent constraints","unconventional single ORF","permissive host environment","hosts","expression","transitional steps","understanding","aa polyprotein","proteomic complexity","daunting gap","NiRAN","additional genes","Ankyrin","open reading frame","presumed limits","unique features","acquisition","coronaviruses","emergence","region","conserved sites of RdRp","Fibronectin type","proofreading exoribonuclease","PSCNV\u0027s","expansion","likelihood","discovery","example","evolutionary analysis","CLpro","relevant substitutions","kilobase","range"],"language":"en"},

Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao(2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission.

Despite this, the pathogenic role of the HBoV is under discussion. The main objectives of the study were: to determine the incidence of HBoV in hospitalized children; to describe the main clinical features of the positive children; and to compare the data with those from other viral infections in the same population. A prospective study was performed between 2005 and 2013 including children up to 14\u2010year old with respiratory infection admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from 3,275 patients and were tested for HBoV and other 15 respiratory viruses by RT\u2010nested PCR. HBoV was detected in 319 patients (9.9%); 80 cases as a single pathogen, and 239 cases (75%) as coinfections with other viruses. The HBoV was the fourth most common virus detected, behind respiratory syncytial virus (39.8%), rhinovirus (30.6%), and adenovirus (15%). The most common clinical diagnosis, in cases that HBoV was detected as a single pathogen was asthma exacerbation followed by pneumonia. A seasonal distribution was shown, with higher positivity rates in December and January. Children affected by HBoV were older than children infected by other viruses. Differences in terms of clinical diagnosis were found, bronchiolitis diagnosis was lower compared with the other viruses, and HBoV was associated with diagnosis of pneumonia, with increased use of antibiotics (41.8%), and radiographic infiltrates (47%).

Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV belongs to the coronavirus family and can induce severe respiratory symptoms in humans, with an average case fatality rate of 35% according to the World Health Organization. Spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV is immunogenic and can induce neutralizing antibodies, thus is a potential major target for vaccine development. Here we constructed a chimeric virus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which the G gene was replaced by MERS-CoV S gene (VSV\u0394G-MERS). The S protein efficiently incorporated into the viral envelope and mediated cell entry through binding its receptor, human DPP4. Knockdown of clathrin expression by siRNA drastically abrogated the infection of VSV\u0394G-MERS in Vero cells. Furthermore, in animal studies, the recombinant virus induced neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses in rhesus monkeys after a single intramuscular or intranasal immunization dose. Our findings indicate the potential of the chimeric VSV\u0394G-MERS as a rapid response vaccine candidate against emerging MERS-CoV disease.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Renqiang; Wang, Jinliang; Shao, Yu; Wang, Xijun; Zhang, Huilei; Shuai, Lei; Ge, Jinying; Wen, Zhiyuan; Bu, Zhigao","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa2947a0f5d1eed034895da62871b9e17ac62048.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113862.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217307301; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217307301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of MERS","MERS-CoV S gene","chimeric VSV\u0394G-MERS","emerging MERS-CoV disease","SARS-CoV","chimeric virus","S protein","neutralizing antibodies","recombinant virus","infection of VSV\u0394G","vesicular stomatitis virus","coronavirus family","vaccine development","G gene","T cell responses","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mediated cell entry","severe respiratory symptoms","potential major target","rapid response vaccine candidate","rhesus monkeys","humans","viral envelope","receptor","siRNA","intranasal immunization dose","average case fatality rate","animal studies","Knockdown of clathrin expression","Vero cells","threatening zoonotic pathogen","outbreak","Spike","human DPP4","World Health Organization","findings"],"language":"en"},

The present study evaluated the protective effect of intranasal PPRV linage 1 and bacterine vaccinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve West African Dwarf (WAD) goats aged 6 months were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of PPRV lineage 1 vaccine (Nig/75), and bacterin from Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) or Pasteurella multocida intranasally. The goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection (PI). Blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase) activities and pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde content, reduced glutathione, hydrogen peroxide generation(,) and myeloperoxidase) using spectrophotometric methods. Data were subjected to parametric statistics at \u03B1=0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 21. RESULTS: Clinically, there were pyrexia, oculonasal discharge, diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats, while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in PPRV and bacterin vaccinated goats. Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically. CONCLUSION: The mucosal vaccination of goats with PPRV vaccine and bacterine will protect against exposure and culminate in the development of protective mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses. This vaccination strategy will provide framework needed in the prevention and control of endemic caprine pneumonia in Nigeria.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarikre, Theophilus Aghogho; Taiwo, Jeremiah Olalekan; Emikpe, Benjamin Obukowho; Akpavie, Stephen Owarioro","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebc2ff4fdabfafc1ceb338e54aa4d11240efeef9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6702579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.945-950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pasteurella"],"organizations":["PPRV","Twelve West African Dwarf","PI"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["unvaccinated goats","mucosal vaccination of goats","bacterin vaccinated goats","PPRV vaccine","weeks post-vaccination","combination of PPRV lineage","current vaccination","vaccination strategy","protective effect of intranasal PPRV linage","reduced glutathione","glutathione transferase","glutathione peroxidase","Mh","weeks post-infection","increased pro-oxidants","petits ruminants virus","development of protective mucosal","bacterine vaccinations","spectrophotometric methods","days PI","continuous endemicity of pneumonia","apparent clinical signs of peste","known infected WAD goat","control of endemic caprine pneumonia","malondialdehyde content","activities","superoxide dismutase","anemia","leukopenia","antioxidants","hydrogen peroxide generation","West African Dwarf","diarrhea","prevention","cell","myriad challenges","fulminant bacterial complication","leukocytosis","oculonasal discharge","Mannheimia haemolytica","moderate neutrophilia","pyrexia","hematology","myeloperoxidase","Nigeria","sera","framework","AIM","parametric statistics","Pasteurella multocida","present study","GraphPad Prism version","MATERIALS","BACKGROUND","exposure","better response","CONCLUSION","Blood samples","immune responses","Data","months","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 \u003E 7 \u003E 8 \u003E 4; YFV: 7 \u003E 5; CVB-2: 25 \u003E 56 \u003E 18; RSV: 14 \u003E 20 \u003E 55 \u003E 38 \u003E 18 \u003E 19; HSV-1: 2.

However, there have been few reports of the problems that infectious disease clinicians encounter when dealing with the protean manifestations of this pathogen. This is a qualitative account of some of the issues faced by an infectious disease physician when identifying and treating patients with SARS as well as protecting other healthcare workers and patients, including: identification of the chain of contagion, early recognition of the disease in the absence of a reliable and rapid diagnostic test, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, and the use of isolation to prevent super-spreading events. Many issues need to be addressed if clinicians are to be able to manage the virus should it reappear.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tambyah, Paul A","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e25232a96d89aba714f301300735226af1f7392b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128902.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904011752; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904011752","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease clinicians","infectious disease physician","SARS","patients","issues","virus","use of isolation","infection control","appropriate use of personal protective equipment","rapid diagnostic test","virology of severe acute respiratory syndrome","public health measures","epidemiology","absence","chain of contagion","early recognition","identification","guidelines","problems","super-spreading events","Summary","healthcare workers","reports","protean manifestations","pathogen","times","qualitative account"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT: The genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV), genus Closterovirus family Closteroviridae, is a single-stranded (\u002B) RNA potentially encoding at least 17 proteins. One (p23), an RNA-binding protein of 209 amino acids with a putative Zn-finger and some basic motifs, displays singular features: (i) it has no homologues in other closteroviruses, (ii) it accumulates mainly in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, and in plasmodesmata, and (iii) it mediates asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNA strands, intracellular suppression of RNA silencing, induction of some CTV syndromes and enhancement of systemic infection when expressed as a transgene ectopically or in phloem-associated cells in several Citrus spp. Here, a yeast two-hybrid screening of an expression library of Nicotiana benthamiana (a symptomatic experimental host for CTV), identified a transducin/WD40 domain protein and the cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as potential host interactors with p23. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation corroborated the p23-GAPDH interaction in planta and showed that p23 interacts with itself in the nucleolus, Cajal bodies and plasmodesmata, and with GAPDH in the cytoplasm (forming aggregates) and in plasmodesmata. The latter interaction was preserved in a p23 deletion mutant affecting the C-terminal domain, but not in two others affecting the Zn-finger and one internal basic motif. Virus-induced gene silencing of GAPDH mRNA resulted in a decrease of CTV titer as revealed by real-time RT-quantitative PCR and RNA gel-blot hybridization. Thus, like other viruses, CTV seems to co-opt GAPDH, via interaction with p23, to facilitate its infectious cycle.","publish_time":"2018-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruiz-Ruiz, Susana; Span\u00F2, Roberta; Navarro, Luis; Moreno, Pedro; Pe\u00F1a, Leandro; Flores, Ricardo","journal":"Plant Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ddceef7fc5e3dce7e3b7f716b74735c8c8d2e1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088584.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11103-018-0783-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CTV RNA","CTV","GAPDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p23-GAPDH interaction","CTV syndromes","RNA-binding protein","p23 deletion mutant","plasmodesmata","asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNA strands","decrease of CTV titer","intracellular suppression of RNA silencing","genome of citrus tristeza virus","Virus-induced gene silencing of GAPDH mRNA","phosphate dehydrogenase","unique protein","RNA gel-blot hybridization","WD40 domain protein","Cajal bodies","nucleolus","putative Zn-finger","viral infectious cycle","cytosolic glyceraldehyde","cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde","basic motifs","symptomatic experimental host","potential host interactors","C-terminal domain","internal basic motif","induction","real-time RT-quantitative PCR","expression library of Nicotiana benthamiana","amino acids","genus Closterovirus family Closteroviridae","multiple functional roles","co-option","enhancement of systemic infection","hybrid screening","transgene","KEY MESSAGE","Bimolecular fluorescence complementation","transducin","planta","phloem-associated cells","singular features","yeast","ABSTRACT","aggregates","homologues","closteroviruses","proteins"],"language":"en"},

However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011\u20132017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: \u003C 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60\u201379% scored 2 (moderate performance); \u226580% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. RESULTS: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simusika, Paul; Tempia, Stefano; Chentulo, Edward; Polansky, Lauren; Mazaba, Mazyanga Lucy; Ndumba, Idah; Mbewe, Quinn K.; Monze, Mwaka","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9998f6aa94bb384f3a93381c404f85506d2a8f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6958603.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931793/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4884-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISS","ISSS"],"locations":["Africa","Zambia"],"keyphrases":["overall score","overall mean score","Zambia","data quality","quality of data","reliability of established influenza surveillance systems","acceptability","weak performance","moderate performance","good performance","influenza viruses","Key improvements","evidence of data reliability","timeliness of samples shipments","national funds","absence of external funds","sustainability","simplicity","evaluation","stability","flexibility","evaluated attributes","information","low cost","increased cost","shipment of samples","geographic representativeness","Key strengths","African countries","policy","Centers","Prevention guidelines","remote sites","Disease Control","public health interventions","geographical coverage","shortfalls","past decade","review period","logistical complexity","pre-defined indicators","viral pathogens","scores","RESULTS","completeness","proportion","outcome","percentage","BACKGROUND","weaknesses","annum","ISSS","utility","total","calculation","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","scale"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: One hundred and seventy three stool specimens and 40 throat samples were collected from 173 hospitalized cases. Epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. RESULTS: Among the 173 cases reported in December 2010, the male\u2013female ratio was 1.88: 1; 23 cases (13.3%) were severe. The majority of patients were children aged \u003C 5 years (95.4%). Some patients developed respiratory symptoms including runny nose (38.2%), cough (20.2%), and sore throat (14.5%). One hundred and thirty eight EV71 positive cases were identified based on real time reverse-transcription PCR detection and 107 isolates were sequenced with the VP1 region. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length VP1 sequences of 107 Linyi EV71 isolates showed that they belonged to the C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype and were divided into 3 lineages (Lineage I, II and III). The two amino acid substitutions (Gly and Gln for Glu) at position 145 within the VP1 region are more likely to appear in EV71 isolates from severe cases (52.2%) than those recovered from mild cases (8.3%). CONCLUSION: This outbreak of HMFD was caused by EV71 in an atypical winter. EV71 strains associated with this outbreak represented three separate chains of transmission. Substitution at amino acid position 145 of the VP1 region of EV71 might be an important virulence marker for severe cases. These findings suggest that continued surveillance for EV71 variants has the potential to greatly impact HFMD prevention and control.","publish_time":"2014-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Nan; Xie, Jing; Qiu, Xiaoli; Jia, Leili; Wu, Zhihao; Ma, Yuhua; Wang, Zhongqiang; Li, Peng; Ren, Xingbin; Hao, Rongzhang; Wang, Ligui; Wang, Yong; Qiu, Shaofu; Song, Hongbin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de38e596838a792c4d5f3f4186ece436b58232ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3974002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMFD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["EV71 positive cases","severe cases","VP1 region of EV71","Linyi EV71 isolates","EV71 variants","EV71 strains","hospitalized cases","mild cases","outbreak of HMFD","amino acid position","amino acid substitutions","Phylogenetic analysis of full-length VP1 sequences","epidemiological characteristics","Linyi City","HFMD prevention","throat samples","majority of patients","sore throat","pathogenic molecular characteristics","laboratory testing","real time reverse-transcription PCR detection","foot","Gln","important virulence marker","Gly","mouth disease","potential","enterovirus","clinical investigations","runny nose","Shandong Province","continued surveillance","genetic analyses","respiratory symptoms","China","Glu","C4 subgenotype","C4a cluster","children","stool specimens","separate chains of transmission","findings","causal pathogen","female ratio","lineages","years","control","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","atypical winter","cough","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the epidemiology and phylogenetic status of HPyV6 must be systematically characterized. METHODS: The VP1 gene of HPyV6 was detected with an established TaqMan real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections. The HPyV6-positive specimens were screened for other common respiratory viruses with real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: The prevalence of HPyV6 was 1.7 % (15/887), and children \u2264 5 years of age accounted for 80 % (12/15) of cases. All 15 HPyV6-positive patients were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, of which influenza virus A (IFVA) (8/15, 53.3 %) and respiratory syncytial virus (7/15, 46.7 %) were most common. All 15 HPyV6-positive patients were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections, and their viral loads ranged from 1.38 to 182.42 copies/\u03BCl nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen. The most common symptoms were cough (100 %) and fever (86.7 %). The complete 4926-bp genome (BJ376 strain, GenBank accession number KM387421) was amplified and showed 100 % identity to HPyV6 strain 607a. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPyV6 was 1.7 % in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections, as analyzed by real-time PCR. Because the coinfection rate was high and the viral load low, it was not possible to establish a correlation between HPyV6 and respiratory diseases.

Influenza virus A(H2N2), which caused a pandemic of so called \u201CAsian flu\u201D in 1957 was expelled from the human population by the new pandemic virus subtype H3N2 in 1968, however, influenza A(H2) viruses continue to circulate in wild birds and poultry. The lack of immunity in human population and the continued circulation of influenza A(H2) among animals makes emergence of a new pandemic virus possible. One of the basic techniques of molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases is the realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim of this work was to design oligonucleotide primers and probes for the rapid detection of influenza A virus subtype H2 by realtime reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of 539 sequences of influenza A(H2N2) virus hemagglutinin gene from GISAID EpiFlu database revealed conservative regions suitable for use as binding sites for primers and probes. 191 probes were designed and 2 sets of primers and probes (H2-1 and H2-2) were selected for further experimental evaluation. Detection limit of RT-PCR system was 50 copies of DNA per 25 \u03BCl reaction when 10-fold dilutions of pCI-neo-H2 plasmid used as template. Analytical specificity of selected sets of primers and probes were tested on wide range of influenza strains and non-influenza respiratory viruses. H2-2 set found to have insufficient specificity detecting seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses and was excluded from further analysis. Analytical sensitivity was further tested on vaccine strain A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) and A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2), limit of detection for primers-probe set H2-1 was 3.2 (CI95%: 3.07\u20133.48) lg EID50/ml. Designed primers and probes for the realtime RT-PCR universal detection of influenza A(H2) viruses could be used in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza A(H2) and screening for H2 in cases of unsubtypeable influenza A in humans.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Komissarov, Andrey; Fadeev, Artem; Kosheleva, Anna; Sintsova, Kseniya; Grudinin, Mikhail","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c9d0ec08d504ab3c209ff0bdd7f173a3266b828.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126497.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2017.06.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850817300658; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850817300658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28652020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza virus","seasonal influenza","Abstract Influenza","sequences of influenza","virus subtype H2","probes","rapid detection of influenza","non-influenza respiratory viruses","continued circulation of influenza","cases of unsubtypeable influenza","realtime RT-PCR universal detection of influenza","neo-H2 plasmid","Designed primers","H2N2","wide range of influenza strains","oligonucleotide primers","primers-probe","limit of detection","Analytical specificity of selected sets of primers","new pandemic virus possible","Detection limit of RT","new pandemic virus subtype H3N2","realtime polymerase chain reaction","PCR system","rRT-PCR","virus hemagglutinin gene","realtime reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction","\u03BCl reaction","human population","Analysis","insufficient specificity","Analytical sensitivity","acute respiratory infections","GISAID EpiFlu database","conservative regions suitable","great concern","binding sites","public health","basic techniques of molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases","fold dilutions of pCI","emergence","excessive morbidity","copies of DNA","animals","screening","mortality","clinical trials of vaccines","H1N1","vaccine strain","lack of immunity","lg EID50","world","wild birds","California","work","template","humans","poultry","Asian flu","Japan","experimental evaluation","aim","CI95"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits.

Following the molecular detection of ECoV in the feces from the initial index cases, the remaining herdmates were closely observed for the development of clinical signs. Fecal samples were collected from sick and healthy horses for the PCR detection of ECoV. All four outbreaks involved primarily adult horses. Fifty-nine horses developed clinical signs with 12\u201316 sick horses per outbreak. The main clinical signs reported were anorexia, lethargy and fever. Four horses from 3 different outbreaks were euthanized or died due to rapid progression of clinical signs.

To reduce antimicrobial use and resistance on dairy farms, research on alternative therapies for calf diarrhea is necessary. Our laboratory previously conducted a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found in colostrum, as a treatment for calf diarrhea. The trial showed significantly reduced calf mortality in diarrheic calves that were administered lactoferrin. Thus, the objective of this study was to corroborate the results of our prior clinical trial across multiple farms and to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of preweaned calves with naturally occurring cases of diarrhea. This randomized field trial was conducted on 5 commercial dairy farms in Ohio. In total, 485 calves (\u226421 d of age) were enrolled at first diarrhea diagnosis (fecal score \u22652 defined as loose to watery) and randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of lactoferrin (3 g of lactoferrin powder dissolved in 30 mL of water) or 30 mL of water (control) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Health assessments were conducted on the day of diarrhea diagnosis (d 0) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d following diagnosis. Producer records of disease treatment and mortality were collected 120 d following diagnosis. A Poisson regression model was used to test differences between treatments in disease frequency through 35 d post-diarrhea diagnosis and the incidence risk of treatment and mortality risk 120 d post-diarrhea diagnosis; the model controlled for calf age at enrollment, farm, and treatment. Median calf age at enrollment was 11 d and ranged from 1 to 26 d of age. At study enrollment, 51.3% (123/240) and 52.2% (128/245) of calves in the control and lactoferrin treatment groups, respectively, were diagnosed with severe diarrhea (fecal score = 3). The frequency of disease (diarrhea, dehydration, depression, signs of respiratory disease) through 35 d following diarrhea diagnosis was not significantly different for calves in the lactoferrin and control groups. Overall mortality risk for enrolled calves was 9.9%, and 10.7% (22/243) and 9.1% (26/242) of calves in the lactoferrin and control groups, respectively, died or were culled in the 120 d following diarrhea diagnosis. The relative risk of death or culling did not differ between treatment groups, however. Therefore, as performed in this study, lactoferrin as a treatment for calf diarrhea was not beneficial.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pempek, J. A.; Watkins, L. R.; Bruner, C.

Six nanoliposomes differing in cationic lipids were formulated and screened in vitro and in vivo for cellular delivery functions in lung cells/tissues. Although the six nanoliposomes showed similar siRNA delivery efficiency in vitro, they exhibited significant differences in pulmonary cellular delivery functions in vivo. Among the various nanoliposomes, cationic dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol (ECL)-based nanoliposomes showed the highest pulmonary cellular delivery in vivo and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro. The delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA in ECL nanoliposomes was 26.2-fold higher than that of naked siRNA in vivo. Treatment with Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1)-specific siRNA (siMcl1) using ECL nanolipoplexes reduced target expression in B16F10 cell lines, whereas control, luciferase-specific siGL2 in ECL nanolipoplexes did not. In metastatic lung cancer mouse models induced by B16F10 or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, intratracheal administration of siMcl1 in ECL nanolipoplexes significantly silenced Mcl1 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue. Reduced formation of melanoma tumor nodules was observed in the lung. These results demonstrate the utility of ECL nanoliposomes for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic siRNA for the treatment of lung cancers and potentially for other respiratory diseases.","publish_time":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shim, Gayong; Choi, Hyun-woo; Lee, Sangbin; Choi, Junhyeok; Yu, Yong Hee; Park, Da-Eui; Choi, Yongseok; Kim, Chan-Wha; Oh, Yu-Kyoung","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/220ea2b637615dfc264482e3dc973d98c4d10cfb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d4b69ab9cf2532659e1e48964722abc74985bddf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f94ba74c761d0359e3df2b9ba4fcf8afbfc35a3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3616525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23380818/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616306554; http://www.cell.com/article/S1525001616306554/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616306554; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2013.10","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["ECL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECL nanolipoplexes","pulmonary delivery of therapeutic siRNA","utility of ECL nanoliposomes","pulmonary cellular delivery functions","pulmonary cellular delivery system","highest pulmonary cellular delivery","delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA","similar siRNA delivery efficiency","lung cells","specific siRNA","based nanoliposomes","various nanoliposomes","lung tissue","naked siRNA","treatment of lung cancers","Lewis lung carcinoma","metastatic lung cancer mouse models","cationic nanolipoplex","cationic lipids","B16F10 cell lines","cationic dioleoyl-sn","silenced Mcl1 mRNA","intratracheal administration of siMcl1","luciferase-specific siGL2","myeloid cell leukemia sequence","Reduced formation of melanoma tumor nodules","LLC","protein levels","target expression","significant differences","control","small-interfering RNA","glycero","cholesterol","ethylphosphocholine","tissues","lowest cytotoxicity","results","respiratory diseases"],"language":"en"},

Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources. In renal disease, TRIs have been most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy and TRIs. The last patient presented at 4 years of age with acute kidney injury of unclear etiology leading to chronic kidney disease. Her biopsy revealed acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with TRIs. Despite extensive evaluation in all 3 patients, including testing for HIV infection and SLE, we could not identify an underlying etiology to explain the presence of TRIs. In conclusion, renal biopsy with TRIs in the absence of underling SLE and HIV remains obscure. We propose a possible role for excess IFN triggered by an abnormal immune response to common viral infections in the formation of TRIs and renal injury.","publish_time":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elmaghrabi, Ayah; Brown, Elizabeth; Khin, Ei; Hassler, Jared; Hendricks, Allen R.","journal":"Case Rep Nephrol Dial","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/485f987d1d6344a2982cd356cc2116b4221ad3fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5567081.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000477661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["TRIs"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["renal biopsy","Formation of TRIs","presence of TRIs","renal injury","renal disease","renal biopsies","renal failure","underlying SLE","HIV infection","years of age","underlying etiology","absence of underling SLE","months of age","excess IFN","chronic kidney disease","acute kidney injury of unclear etiology","infantile nephrotic syndrome","chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis","Case reports of patients","exposure of excess interferon","human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy","electron microscopy","abnormal immune response","common viral infections","subcellular structures","focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","HIVAN","adults","testing","membranous glomerulopathy","Tubuloreticular inclusions","systemic lupus erythematosus","cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum","possible role","pediatric cases","conclusion","exogenous sources","knowledge","extensive evaluation","children"],"language":"en"},

Understanding what influences the uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand and respiratory hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing could help to inform the development of effective public health advice messages. The aim of this synthesis was to explore public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory infections. METHODS: Five online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) were systematically searched. Reference lists of articles were also examined. We selected papers that used a qualitative research design to explore perceptions and beliefs about non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission of acute respiratory infections. We excluded papers that only explored how health professionals or children viewed non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. Three authors performed data extraction and assessment of study quality. Thematic analysis and components of meta-ethnography were adopted to synthesise findings. RESULTS: Seventeen articles from 16 studies in 9 countries were identified and reviewed. Seven key themes were identified: perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions, personal and cultural beliefs about infection transmission, diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections, perceived vulnerability to infection, anxiety about emerging respiratory infections and communications about emerging respiratory infections. The synthesis showed that some aspects of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control (particularly hand and respiratory hygiene) were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take. There was ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours in some contexts due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma. Common perceived barriers included beliefs about infection transmission, personal vulnerability to respiratory infection and concerns about self-diagnosis in emerging respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: People actively evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms of their perceived necessity, efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility. To enhance uptake, it will be necessary to address key barriers, such as beliefs about infection transmission, rejection of personal risk of infection and concern about the potential costs and stigma associated with some interventions.","publish_time":"2014-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teasdale, Emma; Santer, Miriam; Geraghty, Adam W A; Little, Paul; Yardley, Lucy","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d647c6b65ee08b38ecbd2bb85de064df41f7cf0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4063987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920395/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging respiratory infections","uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions","infection transmission","aspects of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control","respiratory hygiene","transmission of acute respiratory infections","perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions","perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions","Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions","public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions","impact of acute respiratory infections","non-pandemic contexts","perceived vulnerability","rejection of personal risk of infection","perceived necessity","personal vulnerability","perceived adverse impact","Common perceived barriers","cultural beliefs","personal distancing behaviours","health professionals","hand","social distancing","social stigma","key barriers","papers","synthesis","aim","development of effective public health advice messages","effective ways","potential costs","key themes","Reference lists of articles","diagnostic uncertainty","concerns","anxiety","children","communications","MEDLINE","CINAHL","PsycINFO","terms","self-diagnosis","data extraction","EMBASE","efficacy","mask","components of meta-ethnography","qualitative research design","online databases","BACKGROUND","assessment of study quality","Thematic analysis","acceptability","isolation","People","Web of Science","authors","METHODS","studies","ambivalence","CONCLUSIONS","responsible actions","findings","feasibility","RESULTS","countries"],"language":"en"},

Eating and sharing meals together among the community\u0027s members, especially relatives and neighbours, are a common practice in both daily life and social gathering events. Fish are a significant protein source and are associated with variety of traditional recipes. Cyprinid fish are one of the most preferred fish by Isaan villagers for daily consumption because they are accessible and affordable. Consumption of these fish probably causes the persistence of high endemicity of human liver fluke infection, particularly with Opisthorchis viverrini, in northeast Thailand. Because the consumption of raw cyprinid fish is a well-documented risk factor for liver fluke infection, sharing of risky raw fish dishes may influence disease transmission through a community. Social network analysis was used to investigate fish and fish-based meal sharing among household members in Isaan villages in liver fluke endemic areas. The findings from three studies confirmed the persistence of traditional Isaan raw fish consumption and food-sharing practice. Social connections via food sharing among villagers played an important role in liver fluke infection and transmission dynamics as a risk factor. Thus these sociocultural factors should be taken into account in designing strategies for control of opisthorchiasis and other food-borne illnesses at the community level.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phimpraphai, Waraphon; Tangkawattana, Sirikachorn; Kasemsuwan, Suwicha; Sripa, Banchob","journal":"Advances in Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/627299eae35e71c737281db1c3d82596b1675db6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126829.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2018.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X18300241; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X18300241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29907257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["preferred fish","consumption of raw cyprinid fish","persistence of traditional Isaan raw fish consumption","risky raw fish dishes","culture traditional raw fish dishes","fish-based meal","food sharing","Isaan villagers","daily consumption","Isaan villages","liver fluke endemic areas","raw fish-eating habits","persistence of high endemicity of human liver fluke infection","common practice","Social connections","variety of traditional recipes","social gathering events","Social network analysis","well-documented risk factor","household members","daily life","disease transmission","transmission dynamics","community\u0027s members","community level","important role","Opisthorchis viverrini","northeastern Thai","neighbours","account","control of opisthorchiasis","relatives","illnesses","studies","significant protein source","strategies","northeast Thailand","Abstract","sociocultural factors","meals","findings"],"language":"en"},

Among many possible applications of the PRRSV infectious cDNA clones, development of genetically modified vaccines is of particular interest. Using infectious clones, the PRRSV genome has been manipulated by changing individual amino acids, deleting coding regions, inserting foreign sequences, and generating arterivirus chimeras. The limited available data suggest that all structural proteins of PRRSV are essential for replication of the virus, and that PRRSV infectivity is relatively intolerant of subtle changes within the structural proteins. The major tasks in PRRSV research are to identify virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms, and to understand the structure\u2013function relationships of individual viral proteins. Utilizing these infectious clones as tools, a new generation of safe and efficacious PRRS vaccines may be constructed.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoo, Dongwan; Welch, Siao-Kun W.; Lee, Changhee; Calvert, Jay G.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/644ae76041ba28d18572e9a5f85fe4885a2ded83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112621.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002351; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002351","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV genome","PRRSV infectious cDNA clones","structural proteins of PRRSV","infectious clones","PRRSV research","PRRSV infectivity","Abstract Full-length infectious cDNA clones","function relationships of individual viral proteins","modified vaccines","possible applications","respiratory syndrome virus","efficacious PRRS vaccines","individual amino acids","limited available data","North American genotypes of porcine reproductive","new generation of safe","coding regions","development","intolerant of subtle changes","foreign sequences","structure","virulence factors","tools","replication","defined mutant viruses","pathogenic mechanisms","arterivirus chimeras","major tasks"],"language":"en"},

Methods During October 26, 2009, and January 23, 2010, adult patients with pneumonia with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected A(H1N1) infections were observed for clinical characteristics, high-resolution chest CT scan, and lung function test changes during acute and 3-month convalescent phases. Results Of the 65 case subjects, the median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR], 28-57) years, 60.0% were men, and 55.4% had at least one underlying medical condition. Sixty-two patients started oseltamivir therapy within a median of 5 (IQR, 4-6) days from the onset of illness, and 31 received IV corticosteroids. ARDS developed in 33 patients, and 24 were treated initially with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). In this group, NPPV was successful in 13 patients (54.2%). Nine patients died at a median of 16 (IQR, 10-24) days after onset of illness. Multivariate Cox regression identified two independent risk factors for death: progressive dyspnea after resolution of fever (relative risk, 5.852; 95% CI, 1.395-24.541; P = .016) and a higher APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score on presentation (relative risk for each point, 1.312; 95% CI, 1.140-1.511; P \u003C .001).

In many cases, malnutrition is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death(2). The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure(3), cardiovascular functions(4) and SARS infections(5). Mechanistically, ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea.

There have been numerous advances in planning, biothreat countermeasure development, licensure, manufacturing, stockpiling and deployment. Increased biodefense surveillance capability has dramatically improved, while new tools and increased awareness have fostered rapid identification of new potential public health pathogens. Unfortunately, structural delays in vaccine design, development, manufacture, clinical testing and licensure processes remain significant obstacles to an effective national biodefense rapid response capability. This is particularly true for the very real threat of \u201Cnovel pathogens\u201D such as the avian-origin influenzas H7N9 and H5N1, and new coronaviruses such as hCoV-EMC. Conventional approaches to vaccine development, production, clinical testing and licensure are incompatible with the prompt deployment needed for an effective public health response. An alternative approach, proposed here, is to apply computational vaccine design tools and rapid production technologies that now make it possible to engineer vaccines for novel emerging pathogen and WMD biowarfare agent countermeasures in record time. These new tools have the potential to significantly reduce the time needed to design string-of-epitope vaccines for previously unknown pathogens. The design process\u2014from genome to gene sequence, ready to insert in a DNA plasmid\u2014can now be accomplished in less than 24 h. While these vaccines are by no means \u201Cstandard,\u201D the need for innovation in the vaccine design and production process is great. Should such vaccines be developed, their 60-d start-to-finish timeline would represent a 2-fold faster response than the current standard.","publish_time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Groot, Anne S; Einck, Leo; Moise, Leonard; Chambers, Michael; Ballantyne, John; Malone, Robert W; Ardito, Matthew; Martin, William","journal":"Hum Vaccin Immunother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfe23d64895beefb7e0fec49126c49d982ffe8da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3906351.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.25611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine development","new tools","design process","computational vaccine design tools","effective public health response","rapid identification of new potential public health pathogens","production process","new coronaviruses","novel pathogens","response capabilities","faster response","epitope vaccines","rapid production technologies","effective national biodefense rapid response capability","clinical testing","licensure processes","unknown pathogens","Increased biodefense surveillance capability","biothreat countermeasure development","integrated US Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise","great strides","increased awareness","prompt deployment","record time","current standard","novel emerging pathogen","WMD biowarfare agent countermeasures","significant obstacles","PHEMCE","manufacture","H5N1","planning","avian-origin influenzas H7N9","strategic preparedness","genome","manufacturing","need","innovation","numerous advances","gene sequence","real threat","Conventional approaches","structural delays","d start","finish timeline","hCoV-EMC","string","means","DNA plasmid","alternative approach"],"language":"en"},

Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n = 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n = 8346, were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined. The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection. And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively.

Despite the antiviral role of autophagy, many studies suggest that some positive-stranded RNA viruses exploit this pathway to facilitate their own replication. In this study, we demonstrate that the equine torovirus Berne virus (BEV), the prototype member of the Torovirus genus (Coronaviridae Family, Nidovirales Order), induces autophagy at late times post-infection. Conversion of microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) from cytosolic (LC3 I) to the membrane associated form (LC3 II), a canonical marker of autophagosome formation, is enhanced in BEV infected cells. However, neither autophagy induction, via starvation, nor pharmacological blockade significantly affect BEV replication. Similarly, BEV infection is not altered in autophagy deficient cells lacking either Beclin 1 or LC3B protein expression. Unexpectedly, the cargo receptor p62, a selective autophagy receptor, aggregates within the region where the BEV main protease (M(pro)) localizes. This finding, coupled with observation that BEV replication also induces ER stress at the time when selective autophagy is taking place, suggests that the autophagy pathway is activated in response to the hefty accumulation of virus-encoded polypeptides during the late phase of BEV infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gin\u00E9s; Diaz-Beneitez, Elisabet; Cubas-Gaona, Liliana L.; Nieves-Molina, Gliselle; Rodr\u00EDguez, Juan Ram\u00F3n; Rodr\u00EDguez, Jos\u00E9 F.; Rodr\u00EDguez, Dolores","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b6962f3ef4cb5e76d6ccd144af840b6aec67474.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6629058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306441/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy pathway","BEV replication","autophagy induction","selective autophagy receptor","antiviral role of autophagy","autophagy deficient cells","BEV infected cells","late phase of BEV infection","BEV main protease","late times post-infection","Torovirus genus","equine torovirus Berne virus","important role","hefty accumulation of virus","cargo receptor p62","LC3B protein expression","lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic macromolecules","encoded polypeptides","damaged organelles","Nidovirales Order","Beclin","region","ER stress","B light chain","Coronaviridae Family","conserved eukaryotic process","studies","prototype member","response","aggregates","place","pharmacological blockade","positive-stranded RNA viruses","canonical marker of autophagosome formation","Conversion of microtubule","starvation","elimination of intracellular pathogens","membrane","observation","study"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Acute respiratory infection is the most common disease occurring over a person\u0027s lifetime, with etiological variations determined mainly by age, environmental circumstances, the healthcare setting, and the underlying pathology. More than 200 different viruses distributed in six viral families have been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infection. These facts are generating an increasing diagnostic demand that should be incorporated into the healthcare setting without delay. To meet this demand, the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology has updated its Standard Procedure for the microbiological diagnosis of viral respiratory infection. This document contains an update primarily of infections caused by influenza viruses, and secondarily, infections due to other conventional and emerging respiratory viruses. In all cases, the methods for direct virological diagnosis (cell culture, and detection of antigens and nucleic acid) are reviewed, with special reference to techniques for molecular detection and genetic characterization.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eiros, Jos\u00E9 M.; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Ra\u00FAl; Tenorio, Alberto; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Ruiz, Guillermo; P\u00E9rez-Bre\u00F1a, Pilar","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e93531356b60a8df880aa983b8fcbd7a353a310.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103319.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X08000402; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X08000402","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola de Enfermedades Infecciosas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and the underlying pathology","and secondarily","and detection of antigens and nucleic acid","the most common","of respiratory tract infection","the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology","have been implicated in the","other conventional and emerging respiratory","the methods for direct virological diagnosis","updated its Standard Procedure for the microbiological diagnosis of viral respiratory infection","for molecular detection and genetic characterization","Abstract Acute respiratory infection","infecciones debidas","\u00E1mbito asistencial","distributed in six viral","generating an increasing diagnostic demand that should be incorporated into the healthcare setting without delay","This document contains an update primarily of infections caused by influenza","In all cases","t\u00E9cnicas de detecci\u00F3n molecular","infecciones virales respiratorias","virus respiratorios convencionales","infections due","detecci\u00F3n de ant\u00EDgenos","diagn\u00F3stico microbiol\u00F3gico","enfermedad de base","with special reference","with etiological variations determined mainly by age","m\u00E9todos de diagn\u00F3stico virol\u00F3gico directo","cell","occurring over a person\u0027s lifetime","reviewed","cultivo celular","Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","different","Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola","These facts","Enfermedades Infecciosas","patogenia","procedimiento","demanda diagn\u00F3stica","More than","familias implicados","particular","\u00E1cido nucleico","lugar","circunstancias medioambientales","incorporaci\u00F3n","primer t\u00E9rmino","meet","infecci\u00F3n respiratoria aguda","caracterizaci\u00F3n gen\u00E9tica","variaci\u00F3n","puesta","d\u00EDa","tracto respiratorio","etiolog\u00EDa condicionada","vida","hechos","casos","gripe"],"language":"es"},

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children 0 to 10 years of age (n = 277) presenting to Manhi\u00E7a District Hospital with clinical pneumonia. Blood samples were collected for HIV and malaria testing, blood culture and full blood counts, and a chest X\u2010ray was performed. A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by seminested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74.4%) children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia. RV was the most common virus identified in both HIV\u2010infected (17 of 38, 44.7%) and HIV\u2010uninfected (74 of 237, 31.2%; P = 0.100) children.

Examining the issue in light of the 2013 detection of polio in Israeli sewage","doi":"10.1186/s13584-017-0182-z","pmcid":"PMC5661933","pubmed_id":"29084599","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The detection of wild poliovirus in Israeli sewage in May 2013 led the health authorities to decide that children who had been vaccinated with IPV would also be vaccinated with OPV. The decision sought to protect vulnerable Israeli individuals who were either not vaccinated with IPV or who suffered from an immune deficiency, to preserve Israel\u2019s status as a polio-free country, to prevent the virus\u2019 \u201Cexportation\u201D into vulnerable polio-free countries, and to participate in the global efforts toward the eradication of polio. After a massive public persuasion campaign, 79% of the children born after 2004 were vaccinated as well as 69% of the children residing in central Israel. A 2014 State Comptroller Report stated that the Ministry of Health should draw conclusions from the low compliance rates in certain Israeli regions. GOALS: The article seeks to examine the legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination in the service of eradicating a contagious disease (as opposed to preventing a pandemic outbreak), which was one of the objectives in the 2013 Polio case. It more specifically relates to current Israeli law as well as to a hypothetical new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination and enforce this through the use of criminal sanctions. METHOD: Qualitative content analysis through the interpretation of court judgements, laws, legislative protocols, health ministry guidelines and documented discussions of the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization. MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A mandatory vaccination backed by criminal sanctions in the service of the eradication of contagious diseases would probably be perceived as infringing on the constitutional right to autonomy to a greater extent than necessary according to Israeli law and case law precedents. There may be some added value inherent in a new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination where nonrestrictive measures have been ineffective. However, the law should also specify a variety of sanctions to accompany the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations which would be formulated from least to most restrictive according to the \u201Cintervention ladder\u201D concept. The law should also describe the circumstances which would justify the implementation of each and every sanction as well as the procedural safeguards designed for established decisions and fairness toward the individual(s) whose rights are infringed by the application of these sanctions.","publish_time":"2017-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamin-Friedman, Shelly","journal":"Isr J Health Policy Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7461fe0adbb9a865f8a79e994c6cd8b8ebdd4e78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5661933.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-017-0182-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPV","OPV","State Comptroller Report","the Advisory Committee","Infectious Diseases and Immunization"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["Ministry of Health","health officials","current Israeli law","health authorities","hypothetical new public health law","health ministry guidelines","case law precedents","Israeli sewage","eradication of polio","Polio case","children","vulnerable Israeli individuals","variety of sanctions","certain Israeli regions","polio-free country","use of criminal sanctions","legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination","vulnerable polio-free countries","service","eradication of contagious diseases","IPV","enforcement of mandatory vaccinations","Infectious Diseases","massive public persuasion campaign","legislative protocols","laws","documented discussions","Advisory Committee","interpretation of court judgements","low compliance rates","autonomy","greater extent","Israel\u2019s status","fairness","established decisions","Qualitative content analysis","detection of wild poliovirus","conclusions","added value inherent","procedural safeguards","constitutional right","nonrestrictive measures","infringing","Immunization","exportation","immune deficiency","MAIN FINDINGS","State Comptroller Report","intervention ladder","rights","article","METHOD","BACKGROUND","global efforts","implementation","concept","central Israel","application","circumstances","objectives","pandemic outbreak","GOALS","OPV"],"language":"en"},

Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred, which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain, being the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV infection in dairy cattle herds of S\u00E3o Paulo State, Brazil, using serological and risk factors analyses. For that, 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test (VNT). RESULTS: VNT results showed high BRSV prevalence in dairy cattle herds, reaching 79.5% of seropositivity. The BRSV seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100%. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV, while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in herds. The high BRSV prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally, the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV seroprevalence.","publish_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoppe, Ingrid Bortolin Affonso Lux; Medeiros, Andr\u00E9a Souza Ramos de; Arns, Clarice Weis; Samara, Samir Issa","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/923eca0b4175d09814a117b685e434c2f93bc25c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6020315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29945679/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1535-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["high BRSV prevalence","high seroprevalence of BRSV","high BRSV seroprevalence","higher prevalence of BRSV","epidemiology of BRSV infection","important risk factor","important management","possible risk factors","analysis of risk factors","bovine herpesvirus","bovine viral diarrhea virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bovine production chain","cattle industry","BoHV","VNT results","natural suckling","adult animals","BVDV","calves","study","dairy cattle herds of S\u00E3o Paulo State","important Brazilian agribusiness sectors","virus neutralization test","protective factor","optimal management","studied farms","viral dissemination","blood samples","obtained blood sera","year old","questionnaire","strong contributor","occurrence of coinfection","initial stages","age group","order","national economy","biosecurity measures","diseases","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","relevant pathogens","seropositivity"],"language":"en"},

As the number of sequenced virus genomes grows into the thousands, and the number of viral proteins into the hundreds of thousands, we report a systematic computational analysis of the point of first-contact between viruses and their hosts, namely viral transmembrane (TM) proteins. RESULTS: The complement of \u03B1-helical TM proteins in double-stranded DNA viruses infecting bacteria and archaea reveals large-scale trends that differ from those of their hosts. Viruses typically encode a substantially lower fraction of TM proteins than archaea or bacteria, with the notable exception of viruses with virions containing a lipid component such as a lipid envelope, internal lipid core, or inner membrane vesicle. Compared to bacteriophages, archaeal viruses are substantially enriched in membrane proteins. However, this feature is not always stable throughout the evolution of a viral lineage; for example, TM proteins are not part of the common heritage shared between Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In contrast to bacteria and archaea, viruses almost completely lack proteins with complicated membrane topologies composed of more than 4 TM segments, with the few detected exceptions being obvious cases of relatively recent horizontal transfer from the host. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic differences between the membrane proteomes of cells and viruses stem from the fact that viruses do not depend on essential membranes for energy transformation, ion homeostasis, nutrient transport and signaling.

Materials and method The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1\u20132 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1\u20132 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akladios, Cherif; Azais, Henri; Ballester, Marcos; Bendifallah, Sofiane; Bolze, Pierre-Adrien; Bourdel, Nicolas; Bricou, Alexandre; Canlorbe, Geoffroy; Carcopino, Xavier; Chauvet, Pauline; Collinet, Pierre; Coutant, Charles; Dabi, Yohann; Dion, Ludivine; Gauthier, Tristan; Graesslin, Olivier; Huchon, Cyrille; Koskas, Martin; Kridelka, Frederic; Lavoue, Vincent; Lecointre, Lise; Mezzadri, Matthieu; Mimoun, Camille; Ouldamer, Lobna; Raimond, Emilie; Touboul, Cyril","journal":"J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101729; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468784720300635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247066/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468784720300635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","gynecologic cancer","endometrioid cancer","cervical cancer","management of patients","pandemic","interval surgery","early stage endometrial cancer of low","low-risk endometrial cancers","patients of high ESMO risk","endometrial biopsy","sentinel lymph node biopsy","primary cytoreduction surgery","sentinel lymph node procedure","value of lymph node staging","neoadjuvant chemotherapy","surgical management","intermediate preoperative ESMO risk","hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy","specific recommendations","case basis","FIGO Ia stage","advanced ovarian cancers","bilateral adnexectomy","PET-CT","National College of French Gynecologists","MRI","MSKCC algorithm","hysterectomy","grade","FRANCOGYN group","Obstetricians","radiotherapy","concomitant radiochemotherapy","line treatment","virus","method","CNGOF","context","months","incurring loss of chance","lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy","Materials","consensus conference model","Abstract Introduction","risks","Results","Conclusion","cycles","days"],"language":"en"},

Oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum and cysts of Giardia duodenalis are shed in the feces of infected animals and directly infect subsequent hosts following ingestion. The broad host range, resistant nature, and small size of the parasites in the environment may potentially contribute to contamination of water supplies. The perception that recreational riding horses may increase the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in large watersheds adjacent to common trails, indirectly infecting humans, has resulted in banning recreational riding horses from some trails. However, there is currently no scientific data linking the recreational trail horse to the incidence or increased risk of human cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis. This survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in recreational horses utilizing trails located near large watershed areas in Colorado. At the trail heads, approximately 10 g of fresh feces were collected from recreational horses (n=300) that were utilizing the trails on the day they were sampled. Fecal samples were mixed with 10% formalin at a dilution rate of 1 part feces to 4 parts formalin and were transported to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Colorado State University. Samples were evaluated using the Merifluor\u2122 Cryptosporidium/Giardia Direct Immunofluorescent Detection Procedure. One horse (0.33%) was detected positive for Cryptosporidium and two horses (0.66%) were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of Cryptosporidia and Giardia in the trial horse population surveyed indicates that the adult recreational trail horse population is not likely to be a significant source of Cryptosporidium and Giardia environmental contamination in watershed areas.","publish_time":"1998-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forde, K.

To date, the sequencing of its whole genome is unavailable as a non-model organism. Transcriptomic information is also scarce for this species. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the first comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for L. aurea using high-throughput sequencing technology. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total RNA was isolated from leaves with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA), or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, stems, and flowers at the bud, blooming, and wilting stages. Equal quantities of RNA from each tissue and stage were pooled to construct a cDNA library. Using 454 pyrosequencing technology, a total of 937,990 high quality reads (308.63 Mb) with an average read length of 329 bp were generated. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced a non-redundant set of 141,111 unique sequences, comprising 24,604 contigs and 116,507 singletons. All of the unique sequences were involved in the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories by GO analysis. Potential genes and their functions were predicted by KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis. Based on our sequence analysis and published literatures, many putative genes involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids synthesis, including PAL, TYDC OMT, NMT, P450, and other potentially important candidate genes, were identified for the first time in this Lycoris. Furthermore, 6,386 SSRs and 18,107 high-confidence SNPs were identified in this EST dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptome provides an invaluable new data for a functional genomics resource and future biological research in L. aurea. The molecular markers identified in this study will provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analyses, and will provide useful information for functional genomic research in future.","publish_time":"2013-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ren; Xu, Sheng; Jiang, Yumei; Jiang, Jingwei; Li, Xiaodan; Liang, Lijian; He, Jia; Peng, Feng; Xia, Bing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd06185d94b38abd3c8209a45897a589da964bf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3621892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23593220/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0060449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Golden Magic Lily"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequence analysis","Lycoris aurea","future biological research","high-throughput sequencing technology","Total RNA","high quality reads","putative genes","EST dataset","COG analysis","unique sequences","novo transcriptome sequencing","important candidate genes","Potential genes","study","important species","future genetic linkage","functional genomic research","high-confidence SNPs","biological process","useful information","molecular markers","Transcriptomic information","Amaryllidaceae family","pyrosequencing technology","functional genomics resource","Amaryllidaceae alkaloids synthesis","molecular function categories","non-redundant set","non-model organism","Equal quantities of RNA","comprehensive expressed sequence tag","quantitative trait loci analyses","cellular component","invaluable new data","TYDC OMT","material basis","bud","stems","treatment","methyl jasmonate","salicylic acid","sodium nitroprusside","P450","functions","KEGG pathway mapping","leaves","published literatures","blooming","flowers","MeJA","NMT","tissue","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","genome","Golden Magic Lily","average","length","wilting stages","SSRs","contigs","assembly","bp","Clustering","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","cDNA library","singletons","time"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, different permutations of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase isozymes may be required for a single cellular function such as occurs during distinct stages of GPCR signalling and in Golgi to lysosome trafficking. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases have recently been implicated in human disease.

As PBB shares common features with other pediatric conditions, further characterization is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy among clinicians. In this study, we aim to further delineate the clinical and laboratory features of PBB in a larger cohort, with a specific focus on concurrent viral detection. Methods Children with and without PBB (control subjects) undergoing flexible bronchoscopy were prospectively recruited. Basic immune function testing and lymphocyte subset analyses were performed. BAL specimens were processed for cellularity and microbiology. Viruses were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacteria were identified via culture. Results The median age of the 104 children (69% male) with PBB was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 12-30 mo). Compared with control subjects, children with PBB were more likely to have attended childcare (OR, 8.43; 95% CI, 2.34-30.46). High rates of wheeze were present in both groups, and tracheobronchomalacia was common. Children with PBB had significantly elevated percentages of neutrophils in the lower airways compared with control subjects, and adenovirus was more likely to be detected in BAL specimens in those with PBB (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 1.50-29.80). Median CD56 and CD16 natural killer (NK) cell levels in blood were elevated for age in children with PBB (0.7 \u00D7 109/L; IQR, 0.5-0.9 cells/L). Conclusions Children with PBB are, typically, very young boys with prolonged wet cough and parent-reported wheeze who have attended childcare. Coupled with elevated NK-cell levels, the association between adenovirus and PBB suggests a likely role of viruses in PBB pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wurzel, Danielle F.; Marchant, Julie M.; Yerkovich, Stephanie T.; Upham, John W.; Mackay, Ian M.; Masters, I.

This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of \u003C20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of \u003E40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple-year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single-year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single-year analysis. This first assessment of on-farm mortality in Swedish dairy herds confirmed that the MR has increased over the last few years. The study also identified some herd-level risk factors.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alv\u00E5sen, K.; Jansson M\u00F6rk, M.; Hall\u00E9n Sandgren, C.; Thomsen, P.

Methods: Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV\u002B D\u002B) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV\u2212 D\u002B); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV\u002B D\u2212) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID\u2212 D\u2212). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GIvl1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. Results: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV\u002B D\u002B, 121 were HIV\u2212 D\u002B, 160 were HIV\u002B D\u2212, and 155 were HIV\u2212 D\u2212. The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4%), Entamoeba histolytica (10.7%), Salmonella enterica (6.6%), and Giardia (4.9%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6%), Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2%), Rotavirus (8.2%), Shigella sp (7.6%), Candida albicans (7.6%), E. histolytica (5.1%), S. enterica (4.4%), and Isospora belli (4.4%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5% in HIV\u002B D\u002B patients; 0.6% in HIV\u002B D\u2212 patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79\u2013250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Conclusion: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.","publish_time":"2001-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gassama, Amy; Sow, Papa Salif; Fall, Fatou; Camara, Path\u00E9; Philippe, Hovette; Gu\u00E8ye-N\u0027diaye, A\u00EFssatou; Seng, R\u00E9monie; Samb, Badara; M\u0027Boup, Souleymane; Germani, Yves; A\u00EFdara-Kane, Awa","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74c3211af6739769cc5afa6f6d6bb2f4c74689cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971201900694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971201900694","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","E. coli","Isospora"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Dakar","Senegal"],"keyphrases":["HIV-serostatus","HIV-infected patients","HIV serostatus of patients","HIV seronegative patients","HIV infection","effective management of diarrhea","main causes of diarrhea","main etiologies of diarrhea","Microsporidium sp","Cryptosporidium sp","Shigella sp","case management","fungi","seronegative controls","Senegal","Rotaviruses","Dakar","Opportunistic parasites","high resistance","frequent pathogens","Different Escherichia coli pathotypes","immunocompetent adults","Kinyoun method","conventional methods","Entamoeba histolytica","Salmonella enterica","cases of multiple infections","low CD4 counts","case-control study","Ordinary enteric pathogens","disk diffusion method","High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides","Trichuris trichiura","cell adherence pattern","GIvl1-ELISA","Sereny test","relation","human immunodeficieny virus","polymerase chain reaction","identification of HEp","higher prevalence","PCR","major types","prevalences of bacteria","range","diarrheic persons","guidance","antibiotics","Isolated enteropathogenic strains","debilitating illness","trichromic stain of Weber","survey","enteroaggregative","physicians","cotrimoxazole","ampicillin","guidelines","goal","commercial latex agglutination kit","epidemiologic data","immunocompromised host","suckling mouse assay","amikacin","gentamicin","Etiologic agents","tetracycline","immunosuppression","Antimicrobial susceptibility testing","norfloxacin","Abstract Objectives","Conclusion","Candida albicans","Isospora belli","Blastocystis hominis","cells","Results","Giardia"],"language":"en"},

By harnessing an evolutionary conserved endogenous biological pathway, first identified in plants and lower organisms, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) reagents are used to bind to and promote the degradation of target RNAs, resulting in knockdown of the expression of specific genes. RNAi can be induced in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 21\u201323 base pairs (bp) in length or by plasmid and viral vector systems that express double-stranded short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that are subsequently processed to siRNAs by the cellular machinery. RNAi has been widely used in mammalian cells to define the functional roles of individual genes, particularly in disease. In addition, siRNA and shRNA libraries have been developed to allow the systematic analysis of genes required for disease processes such as cancer using high throughput RNAi screens. RNAi has been used for the knockdown of gene expression in experimental animals, with the development of shRNA systems that allow tissue-specific and inducible knockdown of genes promising to provide a quicker and cheaper way to generate transgenic animals than conventional approaches. Finally, because of the ability of RNAi to silence disease-associated genes in tissue culture and animal models, the development of RNAi-based reagents for clinical applications is gathering pace, as technological enhancements that improve siRNA stability and delivery in vivo, while minimising off-target and nonspecific effects, are developed.","publish_time":"2005-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Ray K.M.; Whittaker, Paul A.","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0f5ac3adca2c51d81b59bc89daa6232ee8d305a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112686.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725805000628; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725805000628","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of RNAi","ability of RNAi","disease-associated genes","inducible knockdown of genes","expression of specific genes","function of mammalian genes","double-stranded RNA","systematic analysis of genes","mammalian cells","high throughput RNAi screens","functional roles of individual genes","express double","tissue-specific","disease processes","development of shRNA systems","experimental animals","knockdown of gene expression","siRNAs","degradation of target RNAs","introduction of synthetic double","short hairpin RNAs","small interfering RNAs","tissue culture","transgenic animals","RNA interference","based reagents","siRNA stability","shRNA libraries","experimental tool","viral vector systems","animal models","length","plasmid","cancer","clinical applications","technological enhancements","pace","plants","years","lower organisms","cheaper way","evolutionary conserved endogenous biological pathway","bp","base pairs","dsRNA","conventional approaches","delivery","shRNAs","addition","Abstract","nonspecific effects","cellular machinery"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: To provide a framework on which to base effective and efficient antimicrobial therapy for AECB, we present a concise clinical review of AECB, followed by an assessment of the available data on the economic impact of this disease. We then address several AECB-specific issues that must be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial interventions. Methods: Published literature on the clinical and economic impact of AECB was identified using MEDLINE\u00AE, pre-MEDLINE\u00AE, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, Current Contents/All Editions, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases. Other potential sources were identified by searching for references in retrieved articles, review articles, consensus statements, and articles written by selected authorities. Results: In evaluating cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy it is critical to (1) use the disease-free interval as an outcome measure, (2) evaluate the sequence of multiple therapies, (3) address the impact of both current and future antibiotic resistance, and (4) measure all appropriate AECB-associated costs, both direct and indirect. Conclusions: Incorporating these approaches in economic analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy can help health care organizations make evidence-based decisions regarding the cost-effective management of AECB.","publish_time":"2001-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saint, Sanjay; Flaherty, Kevin R.; Abrahamse, Paul; Martinez, Fernando J.; Fendrick, A.Mark","journal":"Clinical Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/787bc1270f847e4cf9ecea68f406811533b9861e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291801800539; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291801800539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AECB","Current Contents/All Editions","International Pharmaceutical Abstracts"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["economic impact of AECB","economic analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy","cost-effective management of AECB","cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy","cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial interventions","AECB-specific issues","appropriate AECB-associated costs","concise clinical review of AECB","efficient antimicrobial therapy","review articles","economic evaluations","retrieved articles","substantial associated costs","results of evidence","morbidity","health care organizations","evidence-based decisions","Health care payers","choice of cost-effective interventions","Current Contents","pre-MEDLINE","outcome measure","EMBASE","Editions","CINAHL","Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis","consensus statements","common condition","HealthSTAR","practitioners","references","approaches","International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases","Abstract Background","Published literature","available data","future antibiotic resistance","innovations","disease-free interval","Methods","assessment","selected authorities","sequence of multiple therapies","Research efforts","framework","Conclusions","potential sources","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

In addition to the government-led public LTCI system that has been piloted in cities such as Qingdao, Chongqing and Shanghai, health insurers such as the China Life Insurance Company are also experimenting with various types of commercial LTCI in the private market. However, the commercial LTCI market is developing very slowly due to public awareness and other reasons. On the other hand, COVID-2019 has had an impact on the cognition of the importance of long-term care for the elderly due to the fact that the death cases of COVID-2019 have been mainly concentrated in the elderly population with chronic diseases such as hypertension. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the differences in the purchase intention of commercial LTCI among the elderly in two different periods: before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019. METHODS By using the Andersen behavioral model and two investigations in two different periods before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019, this study explores the impacts of COVID-2019 on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI. RESULTS Some significant discoveries were found. For example, 25.8% of interviewees showed purchase intention in LTCI in the time before the COVID-2019 outbreak, while this proportion increased to 37.6% after the COVID-2019 outbreak. People who were younger (OR = 2.128, before COVID-2019; OR = 1.875, after COVID-2019) or who had more education (OR = 1.502, before COVID-2019; OR = 2.218, after COVID-2019) were more interested in commercial LTCI. CONCLUSION This study shows that COVID-2019 has had an obvious impact on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI, which provides some enlightenment for China to improve the LTCI system in the future, especially to accelerate the development of commercial LTCI. For example, it is essential to promote the importance of long-term care among the elderly in a focused and targeted way. In terms of the key target audience, it can be developed gradually from the groups with higher education levels and the middle elderly aged 45-64 years old.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xiaocang; Zhang, Lu; Chen, Linhong; Wei, Feng","journal":"Healthcare","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8020126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Chongqing"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of COVID","commercial LTCI market","purchase intention of commercial LTCI","impacts of COVID","development of commercial LTCI","public LTCI system","various types of commercial LTCI","death cases of COVID","elderly population","long-term care insurance","importance of long-term care","middle elderly","study","different periods","PURPOSE","example","China Life Insurance Company","obvious impact","private market","public awareness","higher education levels","health insurers","Chongqing","investigations","time","Andersen behavioral model","important measure","Qingdao","Shanghai","chronic diseases","costs","aging","fact","government","cognition","interviewees","differences","enlightenment","terms","key target audience","METHODS","groups","hypertension","cities","targeted way","future","years old","reasons","addition","attention","CONCLUSION","significant discoveries","People","proportion","hand"],"language":"en"},

Though all ADAMs contain metalloproteinase domains, in humans only 13 of the 21 genes in the family encode functional proteases, indicating that at least for the other eight members, protein\u2013protein interactions are critical aspects of their biological functions. The functional ADAM metalloproteinases are involved in \u201Cectodomain shedding\u201D of diverse growth factors, cytokines, receptors and adhesion molecules. The archetypal activity is shown by ADAM-17 (tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 convertase, TACE), which is the principal protease involved in the activation of pro-TNF-\u03B1, but whose sheddase functions cover a broad range of cell surface molecules. In particular, ADAM-17 is required for generation of the active forms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ligands, and its function is essential for the development of epithelial tissues. Several other ADAMs have important sheddase functions in particular tissue contexts. Another major family member, ADAM-10, is a principal player in signalling via the Notch and Eph/ephrin pathways. For a growing number of substrates, foremost among them being Notch, cleavage by ADAM sheddases is essential for their subsequent \u201Cregulated intramembrane proteolysis\u201D (RIP), which generates cleaved intracellular domains that translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. Several ADAMs play roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function, potentially by effecting maturation of sperm and their adhesion and migration in the uterus. Other non-catalytic ADAMs function in the CNS via effects on guidance mechanisms. The ADAM family are thus fundamental to many control processes in development and homeostasis, and unsurprisingly they are also linked to pathological states when their functions are dysregulated, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This review will provide an overview of current knowledge of the human ADAMs, discussing their structure, function, regulation and disease involvement.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edwards, Dylan R.; Handsley, Madeleine M.; Pennington, Caroline J.","journal":"Molecular Aspects of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c0ad460d92c7cd8ed4e59478fb6095859f2927f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112278.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0098299708000551; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299708000551; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2008.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18762209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ADAMs","ADAM"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADAM family","human ADAMs","ADAM sheddases","cell adhesion","sperm function","ADAMs play roles","non-catalytic ADAMs function","functional ADAM metalloproteinases","important sheddase functions","adhesion molecules","biological functions","important roles","cell phenotype","Notch","effects","cardiovascular disease","fascinating family of transmembrane","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","disease involvement","migration","signalling","major family member","metalloproteinase domains","broad range of cell surface molecules","protein interactions","principal protease","principal player","functional proteases","tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 convertase","diverse growth factors","active forms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor","effecting maturation of sperm","regulated intramembrane proteolysis","particular tissue contexts","development of epithelial tissues","cleaved intracellular domains","activation of pro-TNF-\u03B1","CNS","secreted proteins","cytokines","receptors","critical aspects","EGFR","ligands","ectodomain shedding","TACE","asthma","structure","spermatogenesis","control processes","overview of current knowledge","nucleus","generation","regulation","cancer","humans","cleavage","ephrin pathways","homeostasis","guidance mechanisms","members","disintegrin","growing number of substrates","gene transcription","review","pathological states","archetypal activity","uterus"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Ingredients imported to the USA from China, including organic \u0026 conventional soybeans and meal, lysine hydrochloride, D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D \u0026 E, choline, carriers (rice hulls, corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline, were inoculated with PEDV. Control ingredients, and treatments (ingredients plus a liquid antimicrobial (SalCURB, Kemin Industries (LA) or a 2 % custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA)) were tested. The model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013. To mimic conditions on land and sea, historical temperature and percent relative humidity (% RH) data were programmed into an environmental chamber which stored all containers. To evaluate PEDV viability over time, ingredients were organized into 1 of 4 batches of samples, each batch representing a specific segment of transport. Batch 1 (segment 1) simulated transport of contaminated ingredients from manufacturing plants in Beijing (day 1 post-contamination (PC)). Batch 2 (segments 1 and 2) simulated manufacturing and delivery to Shanghai, including time in Anquing terminal awaiting shipment (days 1\u20138 PC). Batch 3 (segments 1, 2 and 3) represented time in China, the crossing of the Pacific and entry to the US at the San Francisco, CA terminal (day 1\u201327 PC). Batch 4 (segments 1\u20134) represented the previous events, including transport to Des Moines, IA (days 1\u201337 PC). Across control (non-treated) ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional), Vitamin D, lysine hydrochloride and choline chloride. In contrast, viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients using a model simulating shipment from China to the US. This is proof of concept suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients could serve as transboundary risk factors for PEDV, along with the identification of effective mitigation options.","publish_time":"2016-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dee, Scott; Neill, Casey; Singrey, Aaron; Clement, Travis; Cochrane, Roger; Jones, Cassandra; Patterson, Gilbert; Spronk, Gordon; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/430903f42d10ae8f5729df9a61e75e2d6dc09f65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4788872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0674-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26968372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["D \u0026 E","PEDV","Kemin Industries","LA","MCFA"],"locations":["Beijing","China","Des Moines","Pacific"],"keyphrases":["transport of contaminated ingredients","Control ingredients","contaminated feed ingredients","China","subset of feed ingredients","viable PEDV","contaminated swine feed ingredients","ability of PEDV","PEDV viability","PC","transboundary risk of PEDV","transport of cargo","time","simulated transport event","model","days","segments","specific segment of transport","Vitamin D","lysine hydrochloride","Beijing","feed grade tetracycline","shipment","Moines","MCFA","RESULTS","transboundary risk factors","conventional soybeans","soybean meal","manufacturing plants","CA terminal","Anquing terminal","choline chloride","mitigation strategies","batches of samples","identification of effective mitigation options","corn cobs","carriers","historical temperature","percent relative humidity","sea","custom medium chain fatty acid blend","rice hulls","liquid antimicrobial","SalCURB","San Francisco","data","Kemin Industries","Shanghai","methionine","treatments","post-contamination","land","RH","Vitamins","entry","tryptophan","crossing","Pacific","USA","proof of concept","environmental chamber","conditions","delivery","previous events","containers","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","study","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Post-SARS, Canadian occupational health and infection control researchers got together to study how to better protect health workers, and found that training was indeed perceived as key to a positive safety culture. This led to developing information and communication technology (ICT) tools. The research conducted also showed the need for better workplace inspections, so a workplace audit tool was also developed to supplement worker questionnaires and the ICT. When invited to join Ecuadorean colleagues to promote occupational health and infection control, these tools were collectively adapted and improved, including face-to-face as well as on-line problem-based learning scenarios. The South African government then invited the team to work with local colleagues to improve occupational health and infection control, resulting in an improved web-based health information system to track incidents, exposures, and occupational injury and diseases. As the H1N1 pandemic struck, the online infection control course was adapted and translated into Spanish, as was a novel skill-building learning tool that permits health workers to practice selecting personal protective equipment. This tool was originally developed in collaboration with the countries from the Caribbean region and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Research from these experiences led to strengthened focus on building capacity of health and safety committees, and new modules are thus being created, informed by that work. The products developed have been widely heralded as innovative and interactive, leading to their inclusion into \u201Ctoolkits\u201D used internationally. The tools used in Canada were substantially improved from the collaborative adaptation process for South and Central America and South Africa. This international collaboration between occupational health and infection control researchers led to the improvement of the research framework and development of tools, guidelines and information systems. Furthermore, the research and knowledge-transfer experience highlighted the value of partnership amongst Northern and Southern researchers in terms of sharing resources, experiences and knowledge.","publish_time":"2011-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yassi, Annalee; Bryce, Elizabeth A; Breilh, Jaime; Lavoie, Marie-Claude; Ndelu, Lindiwe; Lockhart, Karen; Spiegel, Jerry","journal":"BMC Int Health Hum Rights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aefd921eef67855fd84f460502e9e7277aeb92a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3247839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166059/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-698x-11-s2-s8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Globalization","ICT","Pan American Health Organization"],"locations":["Canada","Caribbean","South","Central America","South Africa","Northern"],"keyphrases":["health workers","Canadian occupational health","building capacity of health","infection control researchers","improved web-based health information system","Pan American Health Organization","occupational injury","online infection control course","development of tools","learning tool","research framework","Southern researchers","information systems","experiences","workplace audit tool","ICT","South African government","better workplace inspections","safety committees","local colleagues","international collaboration","Ecuadorean colleagues","on-line problem-based learning scenarios","knowledge-transfer experience","positive safety culture","rapid spread of infectious diseases","incidents","Central America","value of partnership","Caribbean region","terms of sharing resources","exposures","strain","improvement","strengthened focus","collaborative adaptation process","team","guidelines","working conditions","Post-SARS","key","novel skill","PAHO","need","communication technology","personal protective equipment","new modules","H1N1 pandemic","Spanish","countries","training","worker questionnaires","inclusion","Canada","toolkits","Globalization","products"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to confirm the etiological agent, estimate attack rates and identify risk factors for illness. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including senior school boarders (n=308). Students with ILI (cough and fever) were identified through school medical records. We also conducted a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among senior students including boarders (n=107) and day students (n=45). We collected respiratory specimens for respiratory pathogen testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction from a subset of symptomatic students. We calculated attack rates of medically attended ILI (medILI) and identified factors associated with medILI using logistic regression. We calculated seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medILI. RESULTS: Influenza A (H3N2) virus was detected in 61% (23/38) of specimens. Attack rate for medILI was 13% among boarders (39/308) in the cohort study and 20% in both day students (9/45) and boarders (21/107) in the cross-sectional study. Playing squash was associated with medILI (aOR 5.35, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.68-17.07). Of the boarders, 19% (57/308) were vaccinated before the outbreak. The adjusted VE against medILI was 18% (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38-1.78). The outbreak led to cancellation of several events and the need for academic remedial sessions. CONCLUSION: We confirmed an influenza A (H3N2) virus outbreak with a high attack rate. The outbreak affected academic and sports activities. Participation in sports and social gatherings while experiencing ILI should be discouraged to reduce viral transmission and impact on school activities.","publish_time":"2019-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleynhans, Jackie; Treurnicht, Florette Kathleen; Cohen, Cheryl; Vedan, Theesan; Seleka, Mpho; Maki, Lwando; von Gottberg, Anne; McCarthy, Kerrigan; Ramkrishna, Wayne; McMorrow, Meredith; Walaza, Sibongile","journal":"Pan Afr Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f18965af169be9641eb560e908cc3a4c6ce95bf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6658148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384357/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2019.33.42.16666","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["medILI","outbreak of influenza","senior school boarders","senior students","virus outbreak","day students","school activities","attack rates","cross-sectional study","boarding school","retrospective cohort study","subset of symptomatic students","high attack rate","respiratory specimens","school medical records","sports activities","H3N2","illness","aOR","seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness","risk factors","adjusted VE","respiratory pathogen testing","academic remedial sessions","real-time polymerase chain reaction","Eastern Cape Province","need","events","fever","South Africa","viral transmission","social gatherings","impact","confidence interval","Participation","cancellation","etiological agent","logistic regression","questionnaire","cough","METHODS","RESULTS","squash","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we prospectively investigated the incidence and clinical impacts of viral infection in adults with bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS The study cohort of 119 adults with bronchiectasis was followed up prospectively for 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were assayed for 16 respiratory viruses, using polymerase chain reaction assays. Symptoms, spirometry, quality of life, bacterial cultures, and inflammatory markers were assessed during steady-state bronchiectasis and exacerbations. RESULTS A total of 100 exacerbations were captured from 58 patients during 1-year follow-up. Respiratory viruses were found more frequently in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum during bronchiectasis exacerbations (49 of 100, 49.0\u0027) than during steady state (11 of 58, 18.9\u0027; P \u003C .001). The most common viruses found in patients experiencing exacerbations were coronavirus (19 of 65, 39.2\u0027), rhinovirus (16 of 65, 24.6\u0027), and influenza A/B viruses (16 of 65, 24.6\u0027). Virus-positive exacerbations were associated with a greater increase in markers of systemic and airway inflammation (serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1; sputum IL-1\u03B2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1) compared with virus-negative exacerbations, but the differences in spirometric indexes, quality of life, and bacterial density were unremarkable. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, serum interferon-\u03B3-induced protein 10 yielded an area under curve of 0.67 (95\u0027 CI, 0.53-0.77; P = .018). Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients with virus-positive exacerbations received IV antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of viral infections, detected by polymerase chain reaction assay, is higher in cases of bronchiectasis exacerbations than in steady-state bronchiectasis, suggesting that respiratory viruses play crucial roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations. The potential mechanisms of virus-induced bronchiectasis exacerbations merit further investigations.

Antibodies directed against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS-CoV infection and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity. In contrast, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS-CoV that are recognized by CD8\u002B T cells. In this study, the highly conserved MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein served as a target immunogen to elicit MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for generating MVA-MERS-N expressing recombinant N protein. Overlapping peptides spanning the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in BALB/c mice immunized with MVA-MERS-N. We have identified a H2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope in the MERS-N protein with CD8\u002B T cell antigenicity. The identification of this epitope, and the availability of the MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccine, will help to evaluate MERS-N-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Veit, Svenja; Jany, Sylvia; Fux, Robert; Sutter, Gerd; Volz, Asisa","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dd88265053594d2736a884a8b972b6ae94218c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6316859.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10120718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Ankara"],"keyphrases":["MVA-MERS","MERS-N protein","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV spike","MERS-CoV N polypeptide","conserved MERS-CoV nucleocapsid","antigenic targets of MERS","appropriate murine models of MERS","N candidate vaccine","recombinant N protein","restricted T cell responses","role of T cell responses","specific immune responses","T cell antigenicity","specific cellular immune responses","mediating vaccine","T cells","potential immune correlates of vaccine","clinical vaccine research","CD8","major role","Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara","safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus","severe respiratory disease","H2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope","major histocompatibility complex class","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mediated protection","BALB","novel infectious agent","c mice","death","target immunogen","humans","protective immunity","availability","study","peptides","Antibodies","identification","contrast"],"language":"en"},

CCoVs with different variations are typically pantropic and pathogenic in dogs. In this study, we isolated a CCoV, designated HLJ-073, from a dead 6-week-old male Pekingese with gross lesions and diarrhea. Interestingly, sequence analysis suggested that HLJ-073 contained a 350-nt deletion in ORF3abc compared with reference CCoV isolates, resulting in the loss of portions of ORF3a and ORF3c and the complete loss of ORF3b. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene showed that HLJ-073 was more closely related to members of the FCoV II cluster than to members of the CCoV I or CCoV II cluster. Furthermore, recombination analysis suggested that HLJ-073 originated from the recombination of FCoV 79-1683 and CCoV A76, which were both isolated in the United States. Cell tropism experiments suggested that HLJ-073 could effectively replicate in canine macrophages/monocytes and human THP-1 cells. This is the first report of the isolation of strain HLJ-073 in China, and this virus has biological characteristics that are different from those of other reported CCoVs.

PEDV infection can cause high economic losses in pig industry. In Japan, a PEDV outbreak occurred with high mortality from 2013 to 2015. Even though until now, PEDV infection occurs sporadically. For the control and monitoring of PEDV infection, not only symptomatic pigs, but also asymptomatic pigs should be identified. The objective of this study is to develop and optimize novel indirect ELISA as a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific method for the detection of anti-PEDV antibodies and evaluate the efficacy of the assay as a diagnostic method for PED. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two serum samples, consisting of 81 neutralization test (NT) positive and 81 NT negative sera, were applied to the assay. Indirect ELISA test based on whole virus antigen (NK94P6 strain) derived from Vero cell culture was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with neutralization test (NT) as a reference method, and cut-off value was determined as 0.320 with sensitivity and specificity of 92.6 and 90.1%, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.949, indicating excellent accuracy of indirect ELISA test. There was significant positive correlation between indirect ELISA and neutralization test (R = 0.815, P \u003C 0.05). Furthermore, the kappa statics showed the excellent agreement between these two tests (kappa value = 0.815). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of preserved plates with different periods (1 day, 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months) after drying antigen coated plates were 100% and 80\u2013100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed indirect ELISA test in our study would be useful as a reliable test for serological survey and disease control of PEDV infection, and our pre-antigen coated ELISA plates can be preserved at 4 \u00B0C until at least 6 months.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myint, Ohnmar; Yoshida, Ayako; Sekiguchi, Satoshi; Van Diep, Nguyen; Fuke, Naoyuki; Izzati, Uda Zahli; Hirai, Takuya; Yamaguchi, Ryoji","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e48be328050790f8d642f93c224a2bf0d89c19bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6852973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718620/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2123-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralization test","developed indirect ELISA test","ELISA plates","monitoring of PEDV infection","excellent accuracy of indirect ELISA test","reliable test","disease control of PEDV infection","PEDV outbreak","novel indirect ELISA","detection of anti-PEDV antibodies","virus antigen","specificity of preserved plates","specific method","high mortality rate","reference method","diagnostic method","pre-antigen","study","kappa value","sensitivity","assay","months","high economic losses","NT negative sera","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","watery diarrhea","excellent agreement","asymptomatic pigs","kappa statics","cut-off value","contagious infectious disease","significant positive correlation","serological survey","receiver","dehydration","analysis","NK94P6 strain","different periods","Vero cell culture","characteristic","efficacy","ROC","newborn piglets","day","pig industry","BACKGROUND","tests","CONCLUSIONS","serum samples","AUC","area","curve","RESULTS","weeks","addition","Japan","objective"],"language":"en"},

Pneumonia can be caused by a wide range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi, and the etiology varies by epidemiological setting, comorbidities and whether the pneumonia is community-acquired or hospital-acquired. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia while Gram negative bacteria, often resistant to multiple antibiotics, are common causes of hospital-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia in immunosuppressed individuals. Diagnosis is generally clinical and management is based mainly on knowledge of likely causative pathogens as well as clinical severity and presence of known risk factors.

The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs). In light of these later studies, one can raise the question whether AAs could be responsible for previously and currently widespread unrecognized global renal disease and UUC.","publish_time":"2013-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavlovi\u0107, Nikola M.","journal":"Clin Kidney J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a68da0099e002cdce53a89a826b412f7f8bb15d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4400492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26064484/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sft049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BEN"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bulgaria","Romania","Croatia","Bosnia","Herzegovina"],"keyphrases":["BEN incidence","aetiology of BEN","symptoms of BEN","risk of BEN","chronic renal disease","UUC","pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN","widespread unrecognized global renal disease","endemic nature","renal diseases","AAs","later studies","incidence of new cases","high-prevalence rate","different endemic areas","Balkan endemic nephropathy","high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer","chronic poisoning","biochemical data","clear-cut data","familial clustering","clinical signs","prominent features","Romania","Bulgaria","Serbia","incubation period","Croatia","absence","strong arguments","set of epidemiological","Bosnia","pattern of pathologic injury","past decade","contradictory information","spite of intermittent variations","aristolochic acids","Herzegovina","time","question","conclusive evidence","publication of various hypotheses","entity","years","light","people"],"language":"en"},

Humanized mice, defined here as mice harboring functioning human immune system components, are easily infected with EBV that targets cells of the hematoimmune system. Furthermore, humanized mice can mount both cellular and humoral immune responses to EBV. Thus, many aspects of human EBV infection, including associated diseases (e.g., lymphoproliferative disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and erosive arthritis resembling RA), latent infection, and T-cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been successfully reproduced in humanized mice.

Such standards will also better highlight the important contribution of clinical microbiologists to healthcare. There is a move to larger centralised microbiology laboratories often located off-site from an acute hospital, driven by the concentration of resources, amalgamation of services, outsourcing of diagnostics, automation, an explosion in the range of staff competencies and accreditation. Large off-site centralised microbiology laboratories are often distant to the patient and may not facilitate the early detection of microbial spread. Ultimately, the needs of patients and the public are paramount in deciding on the future direction of clinical microbiology.

We are using the following approaches to the development of industrial production: use of nanoparticles and nanoemulsions as functional adjuvants, construction of totally-safe strains for live attenuated influenza vaccines with deletions of molecular determinants of pathogenicity, application of protein and chemical chaperones to provide self-assembly of haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1v-2009 virus, and impregnation of whole-virion preparations with nanoparticles to enhance antigenicity.","publish_time":"2010-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiselev, O.

Viruses are an uncommon cause of UTIs in an immunocompetent host; however, viruses are increasingly recognized as the cause of lower UTI, especially hemorrhagic cystitis, among immunocompromised patients. BK virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus are predominant pathogens involved in hemorrhagic cystitis after stem cell and solid organ transplantation, and their early diagnosis and treatment may prevent significant morbidity of hemorrhagic cystitis. The diagnosis of viral lower UTI is based on molecular techniques, and real-time polymerase chain reaction is often the method of choice because it allows for quantification of viral load. Cidofovir is becoming a drug of choice in viral UTIs because it is active against the most common viral pathogens.

Some have suggested that the law should be used as a tool to substantively restrict research which is dual-use in nature or which raises moral objections. There are, however, some problems with using law to restrict or prohibit certain types of scientific research, including (i) the inherent imprecision of law for regulating complex and rapidly evolving scientific research; (ii) the difficulties of enforcing legal restrictions on an activity that is international in scope; (iii) the limited predictability of the consequences of restricting specific branches of scientific research; (iv) inertia in the legislative process; and (v) the susceptibility of legislators and regulators to inappropriate factors and influence. Rather than using law to restrict scientific research, it may be more appropriate and effective to use a combination of non-traditional legal tools including norms, codes of conduct, restrictions on publication, and scientist-developed voluntary standards to regulate problematic scientific research.","publish_time":"2009-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marchant, Gary E.; Pope, Lynda L.","journal":"Sci Eng Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2410756499287d9145afdbecb9e5ae5008c3ae1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozg30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["problematic scientific research","evolving scientific research","type of research","specific branches of scientific research","certain types of scientific research","legal restrictions","knowledge","inherent imprecision of law","substantive regulation","combination of non-traditional legal tools","norms","codes of conduct","voluntary standards","regulators","publication","consequences","premise","inappropriate factors","number of regulations","incidental","scientist","activity","inertia","susceptibility of legislators","nature","scope","time","limited predictability","influence","place","difficulties","moral objections","legislative process","recent years","question","problems"],"language":"en"},

Although there have been extensive studies of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, animal models and the immunobiology of infection, there is not yet a convincing and safe vaccine available. The major histopathologic characteristics of RSV infection are acute bronchiolitis, mucosal and submucosal edema, and luminal occlusion by cellular debris of sloughed epithelial cells mixed with macrophages, strands of fibrin, and some mucin. There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but usually one subtype predominates. In temperate climates, RSV infections reflect a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter. It is believed that most children will experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. There are several key animal models of RSV. These include a model in mice and, more importantly, a bovine model; the latter reflects distinct similarity to the human disease. Importantly, the prevalence of asthma is significantly higher amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early childhood. However, there have been only limited investigations of candidate genes that have the potential to explain this increase in susceptibility. An atopic predisposition appears to predispose to subsequent development of asthma and it is likely that subsequent development of asthma is secondary to the pathogenic inflammatory response involving cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors. Numerous approaches to the development of RSV vaccines are being evaluated, as are the use of newer antiviral agents to mitigate disease. There is also significant attention being placed on the potential impact of co-infection and defining the natural history of RSV. Clearly, more research is required to define the relationships between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced inflammatory responses, and asthma.","publish_time":"2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borchers, Andrea T.; Chang, Christopher; Gershwin, M.

Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design, i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memarzadeh, Farhad; Xu, Weiran","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31433374271fc20f6bfc45943a36f1a9b13cb95a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090659/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACH"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["ventilation system design","disease transmission","infection risk","increasing ventilation airflow rate","ventilation effectiveness","transmission of infectious disease particles","contaminant source","study","particle path","isolation room","airborne infectious disease agents","important factor","dilution factor","dominant factor","secondary factor","based analysis","possible infectious agents","higher flow rate","site specific risk analysis","thorough risk assessment","control of contaminants","ventilated room","hypothesized path principle","exact mode of transmission","recipient infection","air changes","air stream","previous studies","suggested control strategy","cost of nosocomial infections","long term cost savings","concentrations","coughing","paper","convincing data","computational fluid dynamics","CFD","exposure","transport mechanism","distance","occupants","scientific approach","United States","situation","hypothesis","evidence","patient","exhaust","extensive literature review","hour","results","future research","organisms"],"language":"en"},

When a transposon is inserted in the intron, it becomes an intronic miRNA, taking advantage of the protein synthesis machinery, i.e., mRNA transcription and splicing, as a means for processing and maturation. Recently, miRNAs have been found to play an important, but not life-threatening, role in embryonic development. They might play a pivotal role in diverse biological systems in various organisms, facilitating a quick response and accurate plotting of body physiology and structures. Based on these unique properties, man-made intronic miRNAs have been developed for in vitro evaluation of gene function, in vivo gene therapy and generation of transgenic animal models.

Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells by silencing gene expression. We further demonstrated, via transient transfection experiments, that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence had a much stronger inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication than the siRNAs targeting the Spike gene or the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides did.

RNA interference against these pathogens has been accomplished by introduction of virus-specific synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or DNA constructs encoding short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Their use as therapeutic antiviral against HIV-1 is limited, because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. In order to solve this durability problem, we tested DNA constructs encoding virus-specific long-hairpin RNAs (lhRNAs) for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 production. Expression of lhRNAs in mammalian cells may result in the synthesis of many siRNAs targeting different viral sequences, thus providing more potent inhibition and reducing the chance of viral escape. The lhRNA constructs were compared with in vitro diced double-stranded RNA and a DNA construct encoding an effective nef-specific shRNA for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 production in cells.

The administration of non-cross-resistant therapies during the post-transplant phase could possibly control residual disease and delay or prevent its progression. To test this approach, 55 patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk NHL or relapsed/refractory HD were enrolled in the following protocol: stem cell mobilization: cyclophosphamide (4.5 g/m(2)) \u002B etoposide (2.0 g/m(2)) followed by GM-CSF or G-CSF; high-dose therapy: gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day \u22125, BCNU (300 mg/m(2)) \u002B gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day \u22122, melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) on day \u22121, blood stem cell infusion on day 0; post-transplant immunotherapy (B cell NHL): rituxan (375 mg/m(2)) weekly for 4 weeks \u002B GM-CSF (250 \u03BCg thrice weekly) (weeks 4\u20138); post-transplant involved-field radiotherapy (HD): 30\u201340 Gy to pre-transplant areas of disease (weeks 4\u20138); post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy (all patients): dexamethasone (40 mg daily)/cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2)/day)/etoposide (30 mg/m(2)/day)/cisplatin (15 mg/m(2)/day) by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days \u002B gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2), day 3) (months 3 \u002B 9) alternating with dexamethasone/paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) (months 6 \u002B 12). Of the 33 patients with B cell lymphoma, 14 had primary refractory disease (42%), 12 had relapsed disease (36%) and seven had high-risk disease in first CR (21%). For the entire group, the 2-year Kaplan\u2013Meier event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 30% and 35%, respectively, while six of 33 patients (18%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. The rituxan/GM-CSF phase was well-tolerated by the 26 patients who were treated and led to radiographic responses in seven patients; an eighth patient with a blastic variant of mantle-cell lymphoma had clearance of marrow involvement after rituxan/GM-CSF. Of the 22 patients with relapsed/refractory HD (21 patients) or high-risk T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (one patient), the 2-year Kaplan\u2013Meier EFS and OS were 70% and 85%, respectively, while two of 22 patients (9%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. Eight patients received involved field radiation and seven had radiographic responses within the treatment fields. A total of 72 courses of post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy were administered to 26 of the 55 total patients. Transient grade 3\u20134 myelosuppression was common and one patient died from neutropenic sepsis, but no patients required an infusion of backup stem cells. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, the EFS for the cohort of HD patients was significantly better than the EFS for an historical cohort of HD patients autografted after BEAC (BCNU/etoposide/cytarabine/cyclophosphamide) without consolidation chemotherapy (P = 0.015). In conclusion, post-transplant consolidation therapy is feasible and well-tolerated for patients autografted for aggressive NHL and HD and may be associated with improved progression-free survival particularly for patients with HD.

The data document quantitative trait loci (QTL) with statistically significant effects on CD4, CD8, and CD8 memory T cells, and on subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells that express P-glycoprotein. Some of the loci detected were robust, in the sense that they produced effects of similar size both in mated female mice, and in a population that included male and female virgin animals. Some of the effects were stable, in that they were apparent at both 8 and 18 months of age, but others were age-specific, showing effects either at 8 or at 18 months but not at both ages. Genes that had an effect on the same T cell subset were in almost all cases additive rather than epistatic, and their combined effects could produce large overall effects, leading in the most dramatic case to a two-fold difference in CD8 memory cells. The analysis also documented two QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 13, that regulate an age-sensitive composite index of T cell subset pattern which has been shown previously to be a predictor of life expectancy in these mice. The analysis thus reveals both subset-specific genes and others which modulate the overall pattern of age-sensitive changes in T cell subset distributions.","publish_time":"2003-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, A U; Galecki, A T; Burke, D T; Miller, R A","journal":"Genes Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD8 T cells","T cell subset levels","T cell subset distributions","CD8 memory T cells","combined effects","significant effects","age-sensitive composite index of T cell subset pattern","CD8 memory cells","large overall effects","subset-specific genes","age-specific","months of age","overall pattern of age","effects of similar size","QTL","mated female mice","populations of mice","analysis","sensitive changes","subsets of CD4","female virgin animals","data document quantitative trait loci","inter-individual differences","fold difference","cross","CB6F1 females","express P-glycoprotein","genetic polymorphisms","C3D2F1 males","progeny","genome scan","cases additive","dramatic case","predictor of life expectancy","sense","ages","chromosomes"],"language":"en"},

The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims of the present study were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the efficiency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00B0C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 105.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 62.2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m(3) and 70.9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m(3) and 66.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for extraction. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus species and Micrococcus species. Conclusion These findings indicate potentially hazardous bioaerosols created during dental procedures can be significantly reduced using an air cleaning system.","publish_time":"2010-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pankhurst, C.","journal":"Br Dent J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Bioaerosols","Air Cleaning System","ACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cfu","mean bioaerosols","hazardous bioaerosols","Background Bioaerosols","creation of bioaerosols","bioaerosol samples","Methods Bioaerosol sampling","treatment procedures","bioaerosol levels","certain dental procedures","bioaerosol sampling pump","mean level of bioaerosols","air rotor","environmental air","dental chair","ACS operation","baseline measurements","available Air Cleaning System","recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment","history","ultrasonic scaling","oral examination","cavity preparation","standard methods","living organisms","Results","Distinct colony types","tooth extraction","standard position","Staphylococcus species","Micrococcus species","blood agar plates","volatile compounds","airborne particles of liquid","potential mechanism","efficiency","local anaesthesia","SPSS","growth","present study","absence of clinical activity","predominant microorganisms","patient episodes","Wilcoxon","rank tests","Objectives","aims","spread of infection","hours","Conclusion","findings","units","significant reduction","clinics"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate the association of RRT with 6-month mortality in patients with severe AKI treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) after OHCA. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicentre observational cohort study that included adult OHCA patients treated with TTM across 22 hospitals in South Korea between October 2015 and December 2018. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality and the secondary outcome was cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to define the role of RRT in stage 3 AKI. RESULTS: Among 10,426 patients with OHCA, 1373 were treated with TTM. After excluding those who died within 48 h of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and those with pre-arrest chronic kidney disease, our study cohort comprised 1063 patients. AKI developed in 590 (55.5%) patients and 223 (21.0%) had stage 3 AKI. Among them, 115 (51.6%) were treated with RRT. The most common treatment modality among RRT patients was continuous renal replacement therapy (111 [96.5%]), followed by intermittent haemodialysis (4 [3.5%]). The distributions of CPC (1\u20135) at 6 months for the non-RRT vs. the RRT group were 3/108 (2.8%) vs. 12/115 (10.4%) for CPC 1, 0/108 (0.0%) vs. 1/115 (0.9%) for CPC 2, 1/108 (0.9%) vs. 3/115 (2.6%) for CPC 3, 6/108 (5.6%) vs. 6/115 (5.2%) for CPC 4, and 98/108 (90.7%) vs. 93/115 (80.9%) for CPC 5, respectively (P = 0.01). The RRT group had significantly lower 6-month mortality than the non-RRT group (93/115 [81%] vs. 98/108 [91%], P = 0.04). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that RRT was independently associated with a lower risk of death in patients with stage 3 AKI (hazard ratio, 0.569 [95% confidence interval, 0.377\u20130.857, P = 0.01]).

However, rapid diagnostic methods with high accuracy for tuberculous pleurisy are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay with pleural fluids from culture-positive TBP patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with exudative pleural effusions used as the samples for Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay. Of these, 265 including 223 patients diagnosed with TBP and 42 non-TBP patients used as controls were analyzed. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF (27.4%), LAMP (26.5%) and SAT-TB assay (32.3%) were significantly higher than that of pleural effusion smear (14.3%, X(2) = 20.65, P \u003C 0.001), whereas they were much lower than expected for the analysis of pleural effusion samples. Both SAT-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated high specificities (100%) and PPVs (100%), but the NPVs of all of the tests were \u003C 22%. The area under ROC curve of pleural effusion smear, LAMP, Xpert MTB/RIF and SAT-TB assays was 0.524 (95% CI 0.431\u20130.617), 0.632 (95% CI 0.553\u20130.71), 0.637 (95% CI 0.56\u20130.714) and 0.673 (95% CI 0.6\u20130.745). SAT-TB assays had the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid amplification tests are not the first choice in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. In this type of test, SAT-TB is recommended because of its low cost, relatively more accurate compared with the other two tests.

This paper addresses these issues through the development of a computational framework for modeling and simulating infectious disease outbreaks in a specific geographic region facilitating the quantification of public health policy decisions. Effectively modeling and simulating past epidemics to project current or future disease outbreaks will lead to improved control and intervention policies and disaster preparedness. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that brings together spatio\u2013temporal geography and population demographics with specific disease pathology in a novel simulation paradigm termed, global stochastic field simulation (GSFS). The primary aim of this simulation paradigm is to facilitate intelligent what-if-analysis in the event of health crisis, such as an influenza pandemic. The dynamics of any epidemic are intrinsically related to a region\u2019s spatio\u2013temporal characteristics and demographic composition and as such, must be considered when developing infectious disease control and intervention strategies. Similarly, comparison of past and current epidemics must include demographic changes into any effective public health policy for control and intervention strategies. GSFS is a hybrid approach to modeling, implicitly combining agent-based modeling with the cellular automata paradigm. Specifically, GSFS is a computational framework that will facilitate the effective identification of risk groups in the population and determine adequate points of control, leading to more effective surveillance and control of infectious diseases epidemics. The analysis of past disease outbreaks in a given population and the projection of current or future epidemics constitutes a significant challenge to Public Health. The corresponding design of computational models and the simulation that facilitates epidemiologists\u2019 understanding of the manifestation of diseases represents a challenge to computer and mathematical sciences.","publish_time":"2007-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mikler, Armin R.; Venkatachalam, Sangeeta; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini","journal":"Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fc193fe88e6466c50aea84e6d906b743c04fcad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-007-0137-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GSFS","Public Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease control","infectious disease outbreaks","control of infectious diseases epidemics","effective public health policy","public health infrastructure","current epidemics","past epidemics","computational framework","future disease outbreaks","analysis of past disease outbreaks","improved control","future epidemics","GSFS","quantification of public health policy decisions","specific disease pathology","novel simulation paradigm","event of health crisis","population\u2019s general health","Emerging infectious diseases","population demographics","given population","intervention strategies","adequate points of control","effective surveillance","projection of current","intervention policies","agent-based modeling","manifestation of diseases","comparison of past","paper","global stochastic field simulation","corresponding design of computational models","cellular automata paradigm","demographic changes","temporal geography","temporal characteristics","region\u2019s spatio","demographic composition","significant challenge","effective identification of risk groups","specific geographic region","burden","development","disaster preparedness","computer","epidemiologists\u2019","strain","hybrid approach","mathematical sciences","issues","primary aim","influenza pandemic","welfare","dynamics"],"language":"en"},

SIRP\u03B1(\u002B) CD8(\u002B) T cells are evident in mice infected with Friend retrovirus, LCMV Clone 13, and in patients with chronic HCV infections. Furthermore, therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 to reinvigorate CD8(\u002B) T cells during chronic infection expands the cytotoxic subset of SIRP\u03B1(\u002B) CD8(\u002B) T cells.","publish_time":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myers, Lara M.; Tal, Michal Caspi; Torrez Dulgeroff, Laughing Bear; Carmody, Aaron B.; Messer, Ronald J.; Gulati, Gunsagar; Yiu, Ying Ying; Staron, Matthew M.; Angel, Cesar Lopez; Sinha, Rahul; Markovic, Maxim; Pham, Edward A.; Fram, Benjamin; Ahmed, Aijaz; Newman, Aaron M.; Glenn, Jeffrey S.; Davis, Mark M.; Kaech, Susan M.; Weissman, Irving L.; Hasenkrug, Kim J.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec270c9ab8ce85885351de4b84f8043f215ebefd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5c5778727b4b3b32b11693ce4082adf30417a67b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6377614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770827/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08637-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCMV Clone"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target cells","subset of functional CD8","surface expression of SIRP\u03B1","Prolonged exposure of CD8","cytotoxic subset of SIRP\u03B1","expression of co-inhibitory receptors","expression of co-stimulatory receptors","chronic infection","chronic viral infections","chronic HCV infections","state of diminished function termed exhaustion","mice","antigenic stimulation","Friend retrovirus","patients","LCMV Clone","L1","protein","CD47","ligand","therapeutic blockade of PD","IFN\u03B3","cytolytic activity","lymphocytes"],"language":"en"},

The covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine, a process referred to as N-linked glycosylation, plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. Most software for glycan modeling on a personal desktop computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. There are a number of popular web-based tools that are available for modeling glycans (e.g., GLYCAM-WEB (http://https://dev.glycam.org/gp/) or Glycosciences.db (http://www.glycosciences.de/)). However, these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations and do not allow the user to incorporate glycan modeling into their protein structure modeling workflow. RESULTS: Here, we present Glycosylator, a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure that can be used directly in a Python script through its application programming interface (API) or through its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward two-dimensional (2D) rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the glycosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific three-dimensional (3D) glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. CONCLUSIONS: Glycosylator was used to generate models of glycosylated protein without steric clashes. Since the molecular topology is based on the CHARMM force field, new complex sugar moieties can be generated without modifying the internals of the code. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. Glycosylator will be a valuable tool for the glycoinformatics and biomolecular modeling communities.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemmin, Thomas; Soto, Cinque","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7528a14c4876dbffb163105631a9dea22f20f83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6806574.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640540/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3097-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHARMM","GUI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modeling glycans","glycan modeling","protein structure modeling workflow","present Glycosylator","biomolecular modeling communities","modification of glycans","Modeled glycans","models of glycosylated protein","canonical glycan conformations","available software","number of popular web-based tools","GLYCAM-WEB","graphical user interface","GUI","large multi-branching glycan structures","application programming interface","class of large","glycosylation state","Python framework","steric clashes","Python script","molecular topology","CHARMM force field","knowledge of molecular dynamics","N-linked glycosylation","sampling alternative conformations","simple monosaccharide","personal desktop computer","new complex sugar moieties","specialized programs","glycoinformatics","API","identification","quick visual inspection","important role","diverse biomolecules","valuable tool","nitrogen atom","physiology","process","sequons","library of predefined templates","genetic algorithm","asparagine","Carbohydrates","glycoprotein","webserver","functionality","covalent linkage","living organisms","BACKGROUND","Glycosciences","RESULTS","internals","code","db","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Piscidin (piscidin 1), caerin (caerin 1.1) and maculatin (maculatin 1.1) could inhibit PRV by direct interaction with the virus particles in a dose-dependent manner and they could also protect the cells from PRV-induced apoptosis.

The economic burden caused by virus infections such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Swine influenza virus, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus 2, Foot and Mouth Disease Virus and many others are associated with severe morbidity, mortality, loss of production, trade restrictions and investments in control and prevention practices. Pigs can also have a role in zoonotic transmission of some viral infections to humans. Inactivated and modified-live virus vaccines are available against porcine viral infections with variable efficacy under field conditions. Thus, improvements over existing vaccines are necessary to: (1) Increase the breadth of protection against evolving viral strains and subtypes; (2) Control of emerging and re-emerging viruses; (3) Eradicate viruses localized in different geographic areas; and (4) Differentiate infected from vaccinated animals to improve disease control programs. Nanoparticles (NPs) generated from virus-like particles, biodegradable and biocompatible polymers and liposomes offer many advantages as vaccine delivery platform due to their unique physicochemical properties. NPs help in efficient antigen internalization and processing by antigen presenting cells and activate them to elicit innate and adaptive immunity. Some of the NPs-based vaccines could be delivered through both parenteral and mucosal routes to trigger efficient mucosal and systemic immune responses and could be used to target specific immune cells such as mucosal microfold (M) cells and dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, NPs-based vaccines can serve as novel candidate vaccines against several porcine viral infections with the potential to enhance the broader protective efficacy under field conditions. This review highlights the recent developments in NPs-based vaccines against porcine viral pathogens and how the NPs-based vaccine delivery system induces innate and adaptive immune responses resulting in varied level of protective efficacy.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhakal, Santosh; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6c3322832e870befdabba94767a6422dfd67d2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6833244.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0712-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694705/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Reproductive","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus infections","porcine viral infections","NPs-based vaccines","live virus vaccines","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","porcine viral pathogens","Swine influenza virus","Mouth Disease Virus","Porcine Circovirus","existing vaccines","Respiratory Syndrome Virus","NPs-based vaccine delivery system","novel candidate vaccines","specific immune cells","dendritic cells","evolving viral strains","adaptive immune responses","mucosal microfold","variable efficacy","systemic immune responses","mucosal routes","broader protective efficacy","disease control programs","field conditions","Control of emerging","varied level of protective efficacy","vaccine delivery platform","efficient antigen internalization","severe economic losses","swine industry","severe morbidity","adaptive immunity","re-emerging viruses","economic burden","persistent health challenges","loss of production","investments","trade restrictions","liposomes","advantages","Foot","potential","biocompatible polymers","mortality","vaccinated animals","subtypes","processing","recent developments","breadth of protection","zoonotic transmission","unique physicochemical properties","role","prevention practices","different geographic areas","improvements","review","DCs","humans","conclusion","Nanoparticles","Pigs"],"language":"en"},

Previously we constructed E1 and E2 epitope maps using murine monoclonal antibodies (mMAbs). Six E2 epitopes (E2(c,d,e,f,g,h)) bound VEEV-neutralizing antibody and mapped to amino acids (aa) 182\u2013207. Nothing is known about the human antibody repertoire to VEEV or epitopes that engage human virus-neutralizing antibodies. There is no specific treatment for VEE; however virus-neutralizing mMAbs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with VEEV by either peripheral or aerosol routes. Therefore, fully human MAbs (hMAbs) with virus-neutralizing activity should be useful for prevention or clinical treatment of human VEE. METHODS: We used phage-display to isolate VEEV-specific hFabs from human bone marrow donors. These hFabs were characterized by sequencing, specificity testing, VEEV subtype cross-reactivity using indirect ELISA, and in vitro virus neutralization capacity. One E2-specific neutralizing hFAb, F5n, was converted into IgG, and its binding site was identified using competitive ELISA with mMAbs and by preparing and sequencing antibody neutralization-escape variants. FINDINGS: Using 11 VEEV-reactive hFabs we constructed the first human epitope map for the alphaviral surface proteins E1 and E2. We identified an important neutralization-associated epitope unique to the human immune response, E2 aa115\u2013119. Using a 9 \u00C5 resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of the Sindbis virus E2 protein, we showed the probable surface location of this human VEEV epitope. CONCLUSIONS: The VEEV-neutralizing capacity of the hMAb F5 nIgG is similar to that exhibited by the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG. The Hy4 IgG has been shown to limit VEEV infection in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Administration of a cocktail of F5n and Hy4 IgGs, which bind to different E2 epitopes, could provide enhanced prophylaxis or immunotherapy for VEEV, while reducing the possibility of generating possibly harmful virus neutralization-escape variants in vivo.","publish_time":"2010-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunt, Ann R.; Frederickson, Shana; Maruyama, Toshiaki; Roehrig, John T.; Blair, Carol D.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2183478af3f9343c0f566eee8b5d95a1abea6754.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2903468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644615/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000739","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. The VEEV","VEEV"],"locations":["South","Central America"],"keyphrases":["human VEEV epitope","human virus","VEEV envelope","VEEV infection","VEEV-specific hFabs","VEEV-reactive hFabs","E2 aa115","E2-specific neutralizing hFAb","Sindbis virus E2 protein","human epitope map","E2 epitope maps","virus neutralization capacity","human MAbs","different E2 epitopes","human antibody repertoire","VEEV subtype cross-reactivity","clinical treatment of human VEE","harmful virus neutralization-escape variants","human immune response","mMAbs","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","human bone marrow donors","sequencing antibody neutralization-escape variants","specific treatment","important neutralization-associated epitope unique","glycoproteins E1","VEE epidemics","mice","humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG","alphaviral surface proteins E1","murine monoclonal antibodies","indirect ELISA","competitive ELISA","cocktail of F5n","probable surface location","\u00C5 resolution cryo-electron microscopy map","cell membrane fusion","specificity testing","prevention","therapeutic agents","binds receptor","enhanced prophylaxis","hMAb F5 nIgG","South","binding site","BACKGROUND","Central America","hMAbs","possibility","amino acids","aerosol routes","immunotherapy","Administration","phage","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines constructed from live, low-virulence (lentogenic) viruses are the most accepted prevention and control strategies for combating ND in poultry across the globe. Avian macrophages are one of the first cell lines of defense against microbial infection, responding to signals in the microenvironment. Although macrophages are considered to be one of the main target cells for NDV infection in vivo, very little is known about the ability of NDV to infect chicken macrophages, and virulence mechanisms of NDV as well as the polarized activation patterns of macrophages and correlation with viral infection and replication. In the present study, a cell culture model (chicken bone marrow macrophage cell line HD11) and three different virulence and genotypes of NDV (including class II virulent NA-1, class II lentogenic LaSota, and class I lentogenic F55) were used to solve the above underlying questions. Our data indicated that all three NDV strains had similar replication rates during the early stages of infection. Virulent NDV titers were shown to increase compared to the other lentogenic strains, and this growth was associated with a strong upregulation of both pro-inflammatory M1-like markers/cytokines and anti-inflammatory M2-like markers/cytokines in chicken macrophages. Virulent NDV was found to block toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 expression, inducing higher expression of type I interferons in chicken macrophages at the late stage of viral infection. Only virulent NDV replication can be inhibited by pretreatment with TLR7 ligand. Overall, this study demonstrated that virulent NDV activates a M1-/M2-like mixed polarized activation of chicken macrophages by inhibition of TLR7, resulting in enhanced replication compared to lentogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Pingze; Ding, Zhuang; Liu, Xinxin; Chen, Yanyu; Li, Junjiao; Tao, Zhi; Fei, Yidong; Xue, Cong; Qian, Jing; Wang, Xueli; Li, Qingmei; Stoeger, Tobias; Chen, Jianjun; Bi, Yuhai; Yin, Renfu","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d088899449bf633659a0c6018571d0f6f7d58ec0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5893744.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","ND","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV infection","virulent NDV replication","NDV strains","Virulent NDV titers","genotypes of NDV","ability of NDV","virulence mechanisms of NDV","lentogenic strains","Avian macrophages","lentogenic viruses","virulent NA","mixed polarized activation of chicken macrophages","polarized activation patterns of macrophages","class","microbial infection","lentogenic LaSota","lentogenic F55","virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus","enhanced replication","early stages of infection","late stage of viral infection","markers","cytokines","similar replication rates","different virulence","low-virulence","chicken bone marrow macrophage cell line HD11","cell culture model","cell lines of defense","important infectious disease","anti-inflammatory M2","inhibition of TLR7","present study","TLR7 ligand","higher expression of type","pro-inflammatory M1","correlation","peridomestic","interferons","control strategies","strong upregulation","accepted prevention","infections","poultry","growth","main target cells","toll","pretreatment","domestic birds","receptor","signals","Vaccines","globe","data","underlying questions","microenvironment"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children\u2019s hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. The RT-PCR assay detected HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 in nasal swabs from symptomatic children \u226418 years. Factors associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P \u003C .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention.

The possible role of Syk in inflammatory signaling cascades has led to the development of pharmacological agents designed to block the Syk catalytic domain as potential novel therapeutics. Whilst the enzymatic activity of Syk lends towards the design of small-molecule inhibitors, other attention has focused on the possibility of targeting Syk expression using anti-sense oligonucleotides as an alternate means of anti-inflammatory therapy. In this study, we compared the ability of multiple optimized Syk siRNA sequences and small-molecule Syk inhibitors to block Fc\u03B5RI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNF\u03B1 secretion in the basophilic cell line RBL-2H3. We also characterized the specificity of each siRNA sequence with regards to off-target induction of the interferon-inducible gene IFIT1. We identified a single siRNA sequence, which displayed a favorable profile of efficient Syk knockdown, blockage of Fc\u03B5RI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNF\u03B1 secretion and a lack of IFIT1 induction. The effect of this siRNA was comparable to that of the Syk kinase domain inhibitors BAY61-3606 and R406.

Aim: To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OAS\u20101 and its relationship with the disease status of HCV infection. Methods: Six SNPs of OAS\u20101 were selected and examined in 409 Japanese patients with chronic HCV infection using the TaqMan PCR genotyping method. The relationship of SNP genotypes and clinical manifestations of patients was analysed. Then, a pair of OAS\u20101\u2010expression plasmids mimicking the clinical\u2010related SNPs were created and transfected into liver cells carrying the HCV subgenomic replicon or the full\u2010length genome, JFH1, and HCV replication after transfection was compared. Results: Patients with genotypes A/A, A/G and G/G of an SNP of OAS\u20101 at the exon 3 of its coding sequence were at gradient increased risks of suffering from higher serum alanine aminotransferase (P\u003C0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.001), higher degree of liver fibrosis (P=0.010) and higher presence of liver cirrhosis (P=0.001).

We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k = 1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.97\u20131.38). When less dispersed with k = 2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity.","publish_time":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Yan, Ping; Sleeman, Candace K.; Mode, Charles J.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/add4c5447ebf4e9f866abebf9915b14dc00ae471.json; document_parses/pdf_json/318d988bf7465f15234a2d307666f12b2d653e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3249525.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3249525?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079419/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311005625; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.10.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311005625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pneumonic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["final size distribution of minor outbreaks","number of offspring","final size data","epidemic data","pneumonic plague","geometric offspring distribution","reproduction numbers of supercritical epidemic processes","negative-binomial offspring distribution","documented major epidemic","human transmission potential","unity","transmission network analysis","subcritical process","proposed method","dispersion parameter","branching process model","yield estimates of threshold values","estimation","rare disease","variation","limited setting","maximum likelihood","sensitivity","absence","probability of extinction","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fully recovered SARS individuals rapidly produced IFN-\u03B3 and IL-2 following stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptides that cover the entire N protein sequence.

It has also been associated with kidney damage in the broiler flocks. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of IBV and its possible involvement in kidney damage of broiler chicks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 clinically diseased broiler flocks from Western and Central Algeria were sampled and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by phylogenic analysis. RESULTS: The QX (100%) and 4/91 (60%) IBV serotypes were the most prevalent in the kidney damaged broilers regardless of vaccination status. The molecular detection of avian IBV by RT-PCR identified six samples as positive, of which only two isolates were typable by sequencing. We identified a novel IBDZ13a genotype which showed 93% sequence homology to the partial-S1 gene sequence of the IB 4/91 commercial vaccine strain. Sequencing analysis characterized this virus as a novel and divergent IB 4/91 field virus with eight amino acid substitutions that might have resulted in altered immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: The isolation of a new IBV strain (IBDZ13a) from vaccinated broiler flocks may explain the failure of the vaccination programs against IBV field strains. Combination of the HI test and RT-PCR indicated that the nephropathogenic IB outbreaks in broilers are related to this novel strain.","publish_time":"2018-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lounas, A.; Oumouna-Benachour, K.; Medkour, H.; Oumouna, M.","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ba1be6ad61854f68d5d05c1bd9b046479a9dafd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6303496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587900/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2018.1630-1636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","Western and Central Algeria","IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of IBV","IBV serotypes","new IBV strain","RT-PCR","IBV field strains","novel strain","diseased broiler flocks","vaccinated broiler flocks","field virus","molecular detection of avian IBV","kidney damage of broiler chicks","kidney damaged broilers","divergent IB","HI test","novel IBDZ13a genotype","AIM","Sequencing analysis","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","nephropathogenic IB outbreaks","commercial vaccine strain","sequence homology","vaccination programs","vaccination status","phylogenic analysis","partial-S1 gene sequence","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","possible involvement","failure","severe economic losses","Central Algeria","amino acid substitutions","poultry industry","hemagglutination inhibition","BACKGROUND","METHODS","isolation","isolates","present study","samples","Combination","CONCLUSION","MATERIALS","altered immunogenicity","RESULTS","QX"],"language":"en"},

It contributes to the understanding of medical explanation, both at the general level of the causes of diseases and at the individual level of the diagnoses of particular cases of a disease. The syntactic, model-theoretic, paradigm, and third-world accounts fail to capture the complexity of medical theories and explanations. Explanations of a disease do not always need to go down to the deep biochemical level displayed. Depending on the problem and audience at hand, a medical explanation may operate at a superficial level\u2014for example, when physicians tell their patients how they got sick. The most important task in medical research after determining the cause of a disease is developing a treatment for it. While drug discovery used to be largely a matter of serendipity or exhaustive search, current pharmaceutical research is based on a deep understanding of the molecular bases of a disease. Once investigators identify the way defective pathways lead to various diseases, they can search selectively for drugs that correct the defects. Psychology and the other fields of cognitive science have contributed to the powerful theories of mental representation and processing\u2014for example, the theories of concepts, rules, images, and neural networks.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thagard, Paul","journal":"Studies in Multidisciplinarity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a219d5fbae61c930ff567bd3d79bacd5dfbf432f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1571083106800080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571083106800080","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical research","nature of medical theories","complexity of medical theories","understanding of medical explanation","application of medical knowledge","theories of concepts","individual level","general level","superficial level","deep biochemical level","example","deep understanding","explanations","powerful theories of mental representation","various diseases","causes of diseases","exhaustive search","current pharmaceutical research","processing","paradigm","way defective pathways","rules","images","development","aspects","diagnoses of particular cases","matter of serendipity","audience","hand","molecular bases","fields of cognitive science","model-theoretic","neural networks","world accounts","investigators","Publisher Summary","patients","physicians","important task","Psychology","problem","drug discovery","drugs","defects","treatment"],"language":"en"},

However, there is currently little information on vaccine studies and commercially available vaccines for PDCoV. Hence, herein, a PDCoV strain, CH/XJYN/2016, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in vitro, and its biological characteristics were determined. Compared to that of previously reported and recently isolated PDCoV strains from China and the United States, the S gene of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain contains novel mutations. Infection studies revealed that CH/XJYN/2016 is pathogenic to suckling piglets and conventional weaned pigs. In addition, the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of PDCoV in conventional weaned pigs was determined (2.0 log10PDD50/3 mL). Furthermore, an inactivated cell-adapted CH/XJYN/2016-based vaccine candidate was developed with different adjuvants. Compared with nonvaccinated pigs, conventional weaned pigs given the inactivated vaccine developed a potent humoral immune response and showed no clinical signs or viral shedding after challenge, indicating a potent protective effect of the vaccine against PDCoV infection. Therefore, the PDCoV vaccine developed in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be used for the control of PDCoV infection in pigs.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Xiang; Zhao, Donghong; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Liping; Li, Mingxia; Li, Weiyan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu; Liu, Xinsheng","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c1c72b625f4023891f00bb34f67ae12508bb545.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125813.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220300010?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247757/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220300010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV vaccine","XJYN","inactivated vaccine","vaccine studies","control of PDCoV infection","conventional weaned pigs","isolated PDCoV strains","based vaccine candidate","promising vaccine candidate","nonvaccinated pigs","Infection studies","inactivated cell-adapted CH","acute diarrhea","median pig diarrhea dose","neonatal piglets","pig industry","novel mutations","potent protective effect","potent humoral immune response","novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","challenge","clinical signs","significant economic losses","United States","dehydration","China","S gene","study","viral shedding","available vaccines","mortality","addition","different adjuvants","little information","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","log10PDD50","biological characteristics"],"language":"en"},

However, there is not an ideal vaccine to provide complete protection against PRRSV. Thus, the need for new antiviral strategies to control PRRSV still remains. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) belongs to the family of C-type lectins, which can exert antiviral activities. In this present study, we assessed the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine SP-A (RpSP-A) on PRRSV infection in Marc 145 cells and revealed its antiviral mechanism using a plaque assay, real-time qPCR, western blotting analysis and an attachment and penetration assay. Our results showed that RpSP-A could inhibit the infectivity of PRRSV in Marc 145 cells and could reduce the total RNA and protein level. The attachment assay indicated that RpSP-A in the presence of Ca(2\u002B) could largely inhibit Marc 145 cell attachment; however, in the penetration assay, it was relatively inactive. Furthermore, our study suggested that virus progeny released from infected Marc145 cells were blocked by RpSP-A from infecting other cells. We conclude that RpSP-A has antiviral activity against PRRSV, most probably by blocking viral attachment and the cell-to-cell transmission pathway, and therefore, RpSP-A holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against PRRSV.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lan; Zheng, Qisheng; Zhang, Yuanpeng; Li, Pengcheng; Fu, Yanfeng; Hou, Jibo; Xiao, Xilong","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e35350d610e0b57178058ec8ac91ceddc3c4048b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101074/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2838-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marc"],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RpSP","PRRSV infection","infectivity of PRRSV","attachment assay","antiviral mechanism","antiviral activity","antiviral activities","cell attachment","penetration assay","new antiviral strategies","novel antiviral agent","plaque assay","viral attachment","antiviral properties of recombinant porcine SP","infected Marc145 cells","cell transmission pathway","virus progeny","protein level","Surfactant protein","present study","respiratory syndrome virus","western blotting analysis","real-time qPCR","significant economic losses","type lectins","swine industry","complete protection","total RNA","holds","ideal vaccine","family of C","need","presence of Ca","results"],"language":"en"},

We have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. Here we attempted to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, as well as an N-terminal polyhistidine tag that can be used for radiolabeling with technetium tricarbonyl. RESULTS: In order to increase circulation time, we experimented with PEGylated and unPEGylated varities typo particle. We also tested the effect of incorporating different numbers of bombesins per nanoparticle. Biophysical characterization determined that all configurations assemble into regular particles with relatively monodisperse size distributions, having peaks of about 33 \u2013 36 nm. The carbonyl method used for labeling produced approximately 80% labeled nanoparticles. In vitro, the nanoparticles showed high binding, both specific and non-specific, to PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, high uptake was observed for all nanoparticle types in the spleens of CD-1 nu/nu mice, decreasing significantly over the course of 24 hours. High uptake was also observed in the liver, while only low uptake was seen in both the pancreas and a tumor xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the nanoparticles are non-specifically taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. Low uptake in the pancreas and tumor indicate that there is little or no specific targeting. PEGylation or increasing the amount of bombesins per nanoparticle did not significantly improve targeting. In particular, the uptake in the spleen, which is a primary organ of the immune system, highlights the potential of the nanoparticles as vaccine carriers. Also, the decrease in liver and spleen radioactivity with time implies that the nanoparticles are broken down and cleared. This is an important finding, as it shows that the nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates that technetium carbonyl radiolabeling of our protein-based nanoparticles can be used to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.","publish_time":"2013-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yongkun; Neef, Tobias; Mittelholzer, Christian; Garcia Garayoa, Elisa; Bl\u00E4uenstein, Peter; Schibli, Roger; Aebi, Ueli; Burkhard, Peter","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41d0c75e25a257485a79211632b5c9ed93d4df14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3832906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24219600/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-3155-11-36","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high uptake","protein-based nanoparticles","self-assembling nanoparticles","low uptake","specific targeting","high affinity","high binding","nanoparticle types","liver","pancreas","immune system","use","reticuloendothelial system","technetium carbonyl","spleen radioactivity","nu mice","circulation time","vaccine platform","vaccine carriers","tumor xenograft","carbonyl method","technetium tricarbonyl","different numbers of bombesins","prostate cancer cells","C-terminal bombesin peptide","N-terminal polyhistidine tag","spleens of CD","potential","configurations","size distributions","regular particles","unPEGylated varities typo particle","risk of prolonged","PC","primary organ","peaks","order","antigen display platforms","receptor","decrease","need","course","certain tumors","Biophysical characterization","RESULTS","scheme","data","drug","side-effects","important finding","pharmacokinetic properties","hours","tools","CONCLUSIONS","nm","BACKGROUND","PEGylation"],"language":"en"},

Epitope\u2010based vaccine design for EBOVs remains a top priority because a mere progress has been made in this regard. Another reason is the lack of antiviral drug and licensed vaccine although there is a severe outbreak in Central Africa. In this study, we aimed to design an epitope\u2010based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immunity by T cell and B cell was checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 42 to 50 and the sequence TLASIGTAF were found as the most potential B and T cell epitopes, respectively. This peptide could interact with 12 HLAs and showed high population coverage up to 80.99%. Using molecular docking, the epitope was further appraised for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post\u2010therapeutic strategy, docking study of predicted 3D structure identified suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein. However, this computational epitope\u2010based peptide vaccine designing and target site prediction against EBOVs open up a new horizon which may be the prospective way in Ebola viruses research; the results require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.","publish_time":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, M.

Mild disease or asymptomatic carriage are probably in many cases common outcomes of infection. To date, two different genotypes of CCoV are known, CCoV type I (CCoV-I) and CCoV type II (CCoV-II). CCoV type II is divided in two subtypes, CCoV-IIa (classical strains) and CCoV-IIb, with CCoV-IIb emerging as a result of a putative recombination between CCoV-IIa and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of CCoV in Greece and to genetically analyze the circulating strains. Between December 2007 and December 2009, 206 fecal samples were collected from dogs with diarrhea from kennels, pet shops and veterinary clinics of different country regions. RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR assays were used for CCoV detection and characterization. CCoV was identified in 65.1% of the dogs presenting diarrhea, being more frequently detected in animals younger than 3 months old and in animals housed in groups. In 47% of the positive samples more than one CCoV genotype/subtype were detected, with triple CCoV-I/CCoV-IIa/CCoV-IIb infections being identified for the first time. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CCoV-I Greek strains share low genetic relatedness to each other and to the prototype CCoV-I strains in the 5\u2019 end of the S gene. Moreover, a divergent CCoV-IIa strain was identified. The circulation of highly variable CCoV-I and CCoV-IIb emerging strains, as well as the detection of the divergent strain, raise concerns on the importance of these new strains as primary pathogens of diarrhoeic syndromes diagnosed in dogs.","publish_time":"2013-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ntafis, Vasileios; Mari, Viviana; Decaro, Nicola; Papanastassopoulou, Maria; Pardali, Dimitra; Rallis, Timoleon S.; Kanellos, Theophanis; Buonavoglia, Canio; Xylouri, Eftychia","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69d2770e0111e5578b202df0763094f78408ec39.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0539d6948423e08c478c70fc52ac53d3c4ea89fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106183.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813000312; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813000312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23410992/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.01.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["CCoV type","CCoV detection","presence of CCoV","CCoV genotype","variable CCoV","triple CCoV","prototype CCoV","CCoV-IIb infections","CCoV-IIb emerging strains","different genotypes of CCoV","divergent CCoV-IIa strain","dogs","new strains","Greek strains","classical strains","circulating strains","divergent strain","etiologic agent of diarrhea","real time RT-PCR assays","animals younger","positive samples","fecal samples","veterinary clinics of different country regions","pet shops","kennels","primary pathogens of diarrhoeic syndromes","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","importance","result","low genetic relatedness","asymptomatic carriage","months old","putative recombination","concerns","TGEV","cases common outcomes of infection","subtypes","phylogenetic analysis","present study","Mild disease","Greece","date","Canine coronavirus","end","S gene","aim","groups","circulation","characterization"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to quantify patient and health-system delays and to identify their associated factors. METHODS: The study of 266 patients was based on public source data from the World Health Organization (WHO) (January 2, 2017\u2013May 16, 2018). The diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were calculated and modelled using a Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: In 266 MERS-CoV patients reported during the study period, the median diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were 5 days (interquartile [IQR] range: 3\u20138 days), 4 days (IQR range: 2\u20137 days), and 2 days (IQR range: 1\u20132 days), respectively. Both patient delay (r = 0.894, P = 0.001) and health-system delay (r = 0.163, P = 0.025) were positively correlated with diagnostic delay. Older age was associated with longer health-system delay (adjusted relative ratios (aRR), 1.011; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.004\u20131.017). Diagnostic delay (aRR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.006\u20131.285) and health-system delays (aRR, 1.217; 95% CI, 1.003\u20131.476) were significantly longer in patients who died. CONCLUSION: Delays in MERS-CoV diagnosis exist and may be attributable to patient delay and health-system delay as both were significantly correlated with longer diagnosis delay. Early MERS-CoV diagnosis may require more sensitive risk assessment tools to reduce avoidable delays, specifically those related to patients and health system.","publish_time":"2019-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bdb7bd65806dc80bb17f0ab669ff6bbc7abc142.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b1b58a2b803ac6e88b012b240c7337f294816ff2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102677.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119301352; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006635/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119301352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["health-system delays","patient delays","longer health-system delay","source of delays","avoidable delays","median diagnostic delays","days","health systems","longer diagnosis delay","World Health Organization","MERS-CoV patients","Early MERS-CoV diagnosis","IQR range","aRR","study period","associated factors","public source data","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","sensitive risk assessment tools","major challenge","relative ratios","BACKGROUND","Older age","CONCLUSION","Poisson regression analysis","confidence intervals","METHODS","RESULTS","aim","literature"],"language":"en"},

Using yeast two-hybrid screen, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified to be an NS5A-binding partner. The NS5A\u2013eEF1A interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays. The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A\u2013eEF1A interaction. Overexpression of eEF1A suppressed the CSFV growth markedly, and conversely, knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the CSFV replication significantly. Furthermore, eEF1A, as well as NS5A, was found to reduce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of CSFV in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay.

It has reached clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers and human papilloma virus warts. Onconase targets different RNAs in the cell cytosol but Onconase-treated cells present features that are different from a simple arrest of protein synthesis. We have used microarray-derived transcriptional profiling to identify Onconase-regulated genes in two ovarian cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8). RT-qPCR analyses have confirmed the microarray findings. We have identified a network of up-regulated genes implicated in different signaling pathways that may explain the cytotoxic effects exerted by Onconase. Among these genes, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a central role in the key events triggered by Onconase in treated cancer cells that finally lead to apoptosis. This mechanism, mediated by ATF3, is cell-type independent. Up-regulation of ATF3 may also explain the antiviral properties of this ribonuclease because this factor is involved in halting viral genome replication, keeping virus latency or preventing viral oncogenesis. Finally, Onconase-regulated genes are different from those affected by nuclear-directed ribonucleases.","publish_time":"2016-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vert, Anna; Castro, Jessica; Rib\u00F3, Marc; Benito, Antoni; Vilanova, Maria","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfd8dbd39a258f0a769375e64f7bd8df0e757266.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5355296.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCI/ADR-RES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Onconase-regulated genes","Onconase targets different RNAs","Onconase-treated cells present features","cell cytosol","treated cancer cells","antiviral properties","regulation of ATF3","ovarian cancer cell lines","cell-type independent","virus latency","viral oncogenesis","transcription factor","microarray findings","human papilloma virus warts","halting viral genome replication","microarray-derived transcriptional profiling","NCI","cancers","new class of RNA","key events","treatment","ADR-RES","ribonucleolytic activity","pathways","damaging drugs","simple arrest of protein synthesis","central role","RT-qPCR analyses","OVCAR","cytotoxic effects","clinical trials","apoptosis","network","ribonucleases","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

During the recent past years, there have been three levels of safety implementation in transfusion: a generalized risk assessment policy; a mastering of processes; standard quality engineering. However, these safety measures have impacts in several ways, such as management and organization, inventory, economics and possibly ethics.

Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines. However, the species that share pathogens most widely with other mammals, and the role of different wildlife groups in sharing viruses with humans remain poorly identified. To address this challenge, we applied network analysis and Bayesian hierarchical models to a global database of mammal-virus associations. We show that domesticated mammals and some primates hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal-virus associations. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses, while the frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than DNA viruses. Among entire host-virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses with other host species, while network centrality of Primates scored relatively high for sharing DNA viruses. Ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses. Acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wells, Konstans; Morand, Serge; Wardeh, Maya; Baylis, Matthew","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2b4457dfacea8aff321ffbca3f52b9a7db2fbae.json; document_parses/pdf_json/228edf7f7e53e88e246fc77b7b7664ac35d7278e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/421511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","DNA viruses","frequencies of sharing viruses","patterns of virus sharing","virus traits","understanding of virus","entire host-virus networks","proportion of zoonotic viruses","likely host species","host specific","central positions","Tracing virus origin","networks of known mammal-virus associations","role of domestic species","pathogen spillover","hosts","humans","domesticated mammals","future spillover events","global database of mammal","network centrality of Primates","network analysis","Health disciplines","times of global change","substantial health threat","role of different wildlife groups","Carnivora","major objectives","Bayesian hierarchical models","addition","Chiroptera","Emerging infectious diseases","strong evidence","challenge","Ungulates","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation, but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS. METHODS: The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection. Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging neuropathogen. The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs. Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric-based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells. RESULTS: Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery. CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co-stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by depleting CNS cellular sources, which limited local reactivation of CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells and reduced viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following neurotropic viral infection. These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, which has been investigated as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative conditions, in which neuroinflammation is a contributing factor.

Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.","publish_time":"1972-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Overall, James C.","journal":"American Heart Journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002870372900774; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002870372900774","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of congenital heart disease","congenital heart lesions","potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease","development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease","study of congenital rubella syndrome","intrauterine rubella","effects of virus replication","intrauterine mumps virus infection","B4 virus infections","Successful control of virus","development of vaccines","identified causative viruses","association of maternal viral infection","etiologic basis","postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis","production of defects","future investigation","suggestive associations","disturbed DNA replication","current status of information","in-depth virologic investigation","pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects","shortened survival time of certain cells","decreased growth rate","chromosomes","mechanisms","Coxsackie B3","obliteration of vascular supply","vast majority of cases","evidence","effective antiviral chemotherapy","variety of types","focal endothelial cell damage","woman","abnormal offspring","pregnancy","recognition","prospective studies","early gestation","results","birth of infants","profitable areas","developing fetus","likely candidates","investigations","cardiac defect","known teratogenic agent","number","addition"],"language":"en"},

Social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are now frequently utilized to address health-related issues. In many geographical locations, such as the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain), these platforms are becoming increasingly popular. The socioeconomic status of the GCC states and their reliable communication and networking infrastructure has allowed the penetration and scalability of these platforms in the region.

Their relatively high rates of mutation and recombination frequencies allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. Although Brazil has 18% of global avian species diversity, studies regarding the presence of avian viral diseases in wild birds in South America are scarce. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of CoVs in 746 wild birds. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained and placed together in vials containing VTM transport medium collected in different regions of Brazil between 2006 and 2013. Screening for viral nucleic acid was performed using conventional RT-PCR and pancoronavirus nested PCR. Positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and ensuing phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the association between virus epidemiology and bird migration routes. Coronavirus RNA were detected and sequenced from six samples, in which three were related to gammacoronaviruses group and the other three to deltacoronavirus group. Our study documents the presence of CoVs related to avian gamma- and deltacoronaviruses circulating in both urban- and poultry-farm regions of Brazil, implicating wild birds as potential carriers of CoVs which may represent a risk to poultry farms and public health in Brazil.

Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another facet of biological complexity.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87897bd73ebb474a31200abceeb4960d18310a3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153321.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163313000076; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163313000076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus persistence","virus isolations","interhost evolution","intrahost evolution","Abstract Viruses","Calculated rates of evolution","nature","error-prone viruses","multiple environmental parameters","key parameters","molecular clock","possible mechanisms","different rates","reemergence of viral pathogens","alignment of viral sequences","number of environmental influences","host population numbers","unpredictable event","infected individual","constant rate of incorporation","genome replication","form of dynamic mutant clouds","mutations","polymerase","fidelity","establishment of phylogenetic relationships","extinction","facet of biological complexity","operation","pandemics","evolving genomes","rise","epidemics","time interval","computational tools","difference","calculations"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to duration of illness. Cases that were 10 or fewer days in duration demonstrated acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases with a time course greater than 10 days showed organizing phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, TTF-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by RT-PCR in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue including the one negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.

Thus, most coronaviruses exit through the apical surface, several through the basolateral one, although the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus appears to use both sides.

Infection by EboV involves fusion between the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the envelope glycoprotein GP2 of the virus. Similar to the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the central feature of the GP2 ectodomain postfusion structure is a six-helix bundle formed by the protein\u0027s N- and C-heptad repeat regions (NHR and CHR, respectively). Folding of this six-helix bundle provides the energetic driving force for membrane fusion; in other viruses, designed agents that disrupt formation of the six-helix bundle act as potent fusion inhibitors. To interrogate determinants of EboV GP2-mediated membrane fusion, we designed model proteins that consist of the NHR and CHR segments linked by short protein linkers. Circular dichroism and gel filtration studies indicate that these proteins adopt stable \u03B1-helical folds consistent with design. Thermal denaturation indicated that the GP2 six-helix bundle is highly stable at pH 5.3 (melting temperature, T(m), of 86.8 \u00B1 2.0\u00B0C and van\u0027t Hoff enthalpy, \u0394H(vH), of \u221228.2 \u00B1 1.0 kcal/mol) and comparable in stability to other viral membrane fusion six-helix bundles. We found that the stability of our designed \u03B1-helical bundle proteins was dependent on buffering conditions with increasing stability at lower pH.

An epidemiological investigation was carried out by the authors between November 2010 and July 2011, leading to the implication of a commercial dietary supplement as the potential cause for this outbreak. The components of this product were first tested in a cell culture model and two of them (dietary chestnut extract and glycerol monolaurate) showed a cytotoxic effect. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of supplemental feeding of both components alone or in combination on liver function in newborn calves on a commercial dairy farm. Ten calves were enrolled in each of the three treatment groups and the control group (group O) following a blocked design. Treatment consisted of supplementation with chestnut extract at 0.02% of birth body mass (BM) (group C), supplementation with glycerol monolaurate at 0.006% of BM (group G) or a combined treatment (group CG) for five consecutive days. The effect of treatments on liver function was evaluated clinically and by measurement of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities as well as the determination of the concentrations of glucose, L\u2010lactate and total bilirubin in serum. There was a significant increase in GLDH and AST activities and a significant decrease in glucose concentration in treatment groups C and CG compared with the control group (p \u2264 0.035), whereas no difference was shown for group G. Survival was significantly decreased in groups C (p = 0.029) and CG (p = 0.001) compared with both group G and the control group. These results suggest that dietary chestnut extract in an amount of 0.02% of BM alone or in combination has a toxic effect on liver function in newborn calves.","publish_time":"2014-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wieland, M.; Weber, B.

This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of the spike (S) gene of 33 FCoVs circulating in Northern Italy between 2011 and 2015 in cats with or without FIP. In order to reconstruct the most probable places of origin and dispersion of FCoV among Italian cats, a phylogeographic approach was performed based on 106 FCoV S gene partial sequences from cats, including the 33 novel Italian sequences and 73 retrieved from public databases. Only FCoV type I was found in the Italian cats. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV was 2.4 \u00D7 10-2 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.3-3.7 \u00D7 10-2), confirming the high genetic variability in the circulating strains. All the isolates clustered in a unique highly significant clade that likely originated from USA between the 1950s and the 1970s, confirming the first descriptions of the disease in American cats. Our results suggest that from USA the virus likely entered Germany and thereafter spread to other European countries. Phylogeography showed that sequences segregated mainly by geographical origin. In the 2010s Italian sequences clustered in different subclades, confirming that different strains cocirculate in Italy. Further studies on archival samples and other genetic regions of FCoV are suggested in order to confirm the present results and to reconstruct a more in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern for the definition of possible control measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauzi, Stefania; Stranieri, Angelica; Giordano, Alessia; Luzzago, Camilla; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Paltrinieri, Saverio; Ebranati, Erika","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a4ed2c49cd505f7ec1e7c93945fcb72e959d04b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152909.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108667; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113520301371; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520301371?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["Italian cats","s Italian sequences","dispersion of FCoV","FCoV S gene partial sequences","FCoV type","genetic regions of FCoV","novel Italian sequences","American cats","genetic characteristics","Feline infectious peritonitis","estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV","deadly infectious feline disease","circulating strains","order","USA","FIP","different strains cocirculate","high genetic variability","ABSTRACT Feline coronavirus","different subclades","Northern Italy","geographical origin","present results","in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern","probable places of origin","host","definition of possible control measures","archival samples","inadequate immune response","FCoVs","spike","descriptions","phylogeographic approach","significant clade","site","year","studies","Germany","public databases","subs","HPD","isolates","study","European countries","Phylogeography"],"language":"en"},

Calves (n =100) aged 15\u201360 days were clinically examined and faecal samples, blood samples and deep nasopharyngeal swabs obtained. The samples were analysed for intestinal pathogens, acute phase proteins and WBC count, and respiratory tract pathogens, respectively. Diarrhoea was diagnosed in 32.6% (23.3\u201343.0%, 95% CI) of calves. An association between the pathogenic Eimeria spp. and diarrhoea was detected by multiple correspondence analysis. Eimeria related signs (diarrhoea, presence of pathogenic species and total oocyst count) were combined resulting a four level variable.

This review reports some research results obtained in the development of devices which exploit organic materials\u2019 properties in order to detect biologically significant molecules as well as to trigger/capture signals from the biological environment. Among the many investigated sensing devices, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and microcantilevers (MCLs) have been chosen. The main factors motivating this choice are their label-free detection approach, which is particularly important when addressing complex biological processes, as well as the possibility to integrate them in an electronic circuit. Particular attention is paid to the design and realization of biocompatible surfaces which can be employed in the recognition of pertinent molecules as well as to the research of new materials, both natural and inspired by nature, as a first approach to environmentally friendly electronics.

In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27 days), on the concentrations of air pollutants in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and BTEX were compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, the PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6\u201334% compared to the average on the same days in 2018\u20132019, and still, it exceeded WHO daily limit values for 18 days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and NO2 concentrations by 49% and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O3 levels by 15% compared to the prior 17 days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene and toluene were 2\u20133 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 2015\u20132019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerimray, Aiymgul; Baimatova, Nassiba; Ibragimova, Olga P.; Bukenov, Bauyrzhan; Kenessov, Bulat; Plotitsyn, Pavel; Karaca, Ferhat","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10096cf5f6a86de9362a5085c2c9c9d1e65c007b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387822/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139179; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326966?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kazakhstan"],"keyphrases":["days","Almaty","NO2 concentrations","concentrations of air pollutants","Daily concentrations of PM2","concentrations of benzene","COVID","various nontraffic related sources","pollution levels","O3 levels","spatial variations","complex nature of air pollution","possible small irregular sources","spatial effects","substantial reductions","temporal reductions","city-scale quarantine","favorable meteorological variations","daily limit values","Abstract Number of cities worlwide experienced air quality improvements","power plants","household heating systems","places","major contributions","combined heat","garbage","impact of traffic","lockdowns","toluene","changes","force","SO2","times higher","results","case","BTEX","bathhouses","increase","periods","Kazakhstan","study","week","average","seasons"],"language":"en"},

In this article, the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the \u201Ceveryday emergencies\u201D in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning, a whole-of-government commitment to equal access, and implementation of universal design strategies. Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present health-damaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible.

This fatal zoonotic pathogen was first described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79.50\u201384.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28%, 95% CI 71.14\u201377.19) than male camels (P \u003C 0.001) (53.74%, 95% CI 48.48\u201358.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses. None of the human plasma screened contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. This study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels. Further one-health surveillance approaches in camels, wildlife, and human populations are needed.

The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of IC measures that limited exposure of HCWs to potentially infectious individuals. As the \u2018global village\u2019 becomes smaller and other microbial threats to health emerge, or re-emerge, there is an urgent need to develop a global strategy for infection control in hospitals. This paper provides an overview of the main IC practices employed during the 2003 SARS outbreak, including management measures, dedicated SARS hospitals, personal protective equipment, isolation, handwashing, environmental decontamination, education and training. The psychological and psychosocial impact on HCWs during the outbreak are also discussed. Requirements for IC programmes in the post-SARS period are proposed based on the major lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Karen","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad64637f84246d552d9d2cc5b13d66a51f8cc7bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118748.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350605002362; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350605002362","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IC"],"locations":["Hong Kong","China","Taiwan","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","SARS coronavirus","dedicated SARS hospitals","post-SARS period","causative agent of SARS","significant hospital outbreaks of SARS","IC precautions","IC programmes","stringent application of IC measures","exposure of HCWs","main IC practices","management measures","healthcare facilities","healthcare setting","lack of infection control","affected healthcare workers","large-scale hospital outbreaks","High infection rates","global strategy","global village","airborne transmission","novel coronavirus","efficiency of transmission","infectious individuals","large respiratory droplets","new infectious disease","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","personal protective equipment","handwashing","isolation","Canada","Hong Kong","China","environmental decontamination","Singapore","indirect contact","concept","failure","Taiwan","education","overview","psychosocial impact","patients","microbial threats","super-spreading events\u2019","major lessons","Vietnam","training","urgent need","Requirements","theory","paper","visitors"],"language":"en"}]}

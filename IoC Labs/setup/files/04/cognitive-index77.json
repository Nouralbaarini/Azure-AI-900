A number of recent systematic reviews have either included or focused on garden-based interventions for young children. However, most prior reviews including young children only focus on one health outcome or one setting, making a full summary of prior research assessing the impact of garden-based interventions nonexistent. As such, this umbrella systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on health outcomes of garden-based interventions for young children. METHODS This protocol outlines the systematic steps we will take to conduct an umbrella review on health-related outcomes of garden-based interventions in children younger than 6 years of age. We will systematically search PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, OVID-Agricola, and CAB Direct, including all systematic reviews and meta-analyses fitting the pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will double screen at each phase of the review: title/abstract, full text, data extraction, and quality appraisal. We will assess the quality of included reviews using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2). Based on the potential for stark variability in what how reviews report child health outcomes, we will analyze the reviews both narratively and quantitatively, reporting summary of findings tables and iteratively mapping the results. This protocol aligns with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement (PRISMA-P). DISCUSSION This umbrella review aims to summarize the role that garden-based interventions play in health promotion for young children. We will focus on a number of diverse child health outcomes in an effort to comprehensively synthesize the evidence to inform future garden-based interventions, research, and policy.

Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for anal fistula. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes assessed and reported in these studies. This limits research quality and complicates evidence synthesis. A solution for heterogeneity in outcome reporting is the development of a Core Outcome Set (COS). This paper describes the protocol for the development of a European COS for Anal Fistula (AFCOS). METHODS The first step will be a systematic review of the literature to identify potential outcomes that may be included in the COS. Patient interviews will be conducted in The United Kingdom and The Netherlands to ensure that both clinician-important and patient-important outcomes are captured. The outcomes will be categorized using the COMET taxonomy and taken forward to a Delphi consensus exercise. In up to three web-based Delphi surveys the outcomes will be prioritized by patients, clinicians (surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists), and (clinical) researchers. The responses will be summarized and reported anonymously in subsequent round(s) facilitating convergence to a consensus opinion. The final COS will be decided during a face-to-face consensus meeting with patients, clinicians, and (clinical) researchers.

Currently new notifications in Australia are mostly considered to be locally-acquired with some cases still reported among people with recent overseas travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.

Unfortunately, the Nigeria media is awash with images of misuse and abuse of face masks by the public, government officials, and healthcare workers. Medical masks are used widely in community settings amid reported scarcity within healthcare facilities. It is observed that some people wear face masks on their chin and neck, and mask wearers give no attention to covering their mouth and nose, especially when talking. Used face masks are kept with personal belongings or disposed indiscriminately in public spaces, leading to self and environmental contamination. Inappropriate use and disposal of face masks in Nigeria could promote the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country and negate the country\u0027s efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In the implementation of the universal masking policy in Nigeria, federal and state governments ought to consider local applicability, feasibility, and sustainability, as well as identify and mitigate all potential risks and unintended consequences.

Evidence has demonstrated an association of benzodiazepines with adverse neuropsychiatric effects. Nonetheless, because of their potential benefits, perioperative benzodiazepines continue to be used routinely. We seek to evaluate the body of evidence of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepine use during the perioperative period. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science from inception to March 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating the administration of benzodiazepine medications as compared with all other medications (or nothing) in patients undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. We will exclude studies assessing the use of benzodiazepines for procedural sedation or day surgery. We will examine the impact of giving these medications before, during and after surgery. Outcomes of interest include the incidence of delirium, duration of delirium, postprocedure cognitive change, the incidence of intraoperative awareness, patient satisfaction/quality of life/quality of recovery, length-of-stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality.Reviewers will screen references and assess eligibility using predefined criteria independently and in duplicate. Two reviewers will independently collect data using prepiloted forms. We will present results separately for RCTs and observational studies. We will pool data using a random effect model and present results as relative risk with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We will pool adjusted ORs for observational studies. We will assess risk of bias for individual studies using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs. For observational studies, we will use tools designed by the Clinical Advances through Research and Information Translation group. Quality of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review involves no patient contact and no interaction with healthcare providers or systems. As such, we did not seek ethics board approval.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an effective imaging method for evaluating the renovascular morphology of donor candidates. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal artery variations in kidney donors using CTA and compare the findings with the number of arteries detected during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 2,144 living donors who underwent pretransplant renovascular assessment using CTA and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in our center between August 2012 and October 2018. The number of renal arteries to the donor kidney detected on CTA was compared with the number of arteries discovered intraoperatively. RESULTS The mean age of the 2,144 living kidney donors included in the study was 47.19 \u00B1 13.3 (18-87) years. According to CTA findings, 81.1% (n = 1,738) had a single renal artery, 17.2% (n = 369) had double renal arteries, 1.6% (n = 35) had triple renal arteries, and 0.1% (n = 2) had quadruple renal arteries. The same number of renal arteries were detected by CTA and in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in 97.9% (n = 2,099) of the donors. In the other 2.1% (n = 45), fewer renal arteries were detected intraoperatively compared to their CTA findings. None of the donors included in the study had a greater number of renal arteries discovered during nephrectomy than by CTA. CONCLUSION CTA is a highly accurate method for the evaluation of renovascular variations in donor candidates for living-donor kidney transplantation. However, it must be kept in mind that double or multiple renal artery variations may be detected on CTA in 18.9% of donor candidates.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarier, Mehmet; Callioglu, Mehmet; Yuksel, Yucel; Duman, Enes; Emek, Mestan; Usta, Sibel Surmen","journal":"Urologia internationalis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of arteries","triple renal arteries","fewer renal arteries","CTA findings","greater number of renal arteries","prepared kidney donor","laparoscopic donor nephrectomy","living-donor kidney transplantation","CONCLUSION CTA","living kidney donors","single renal artery","living donors","renovascular morphology of donor candidates","multiple renal artery variations","study","evaluation of renovascular variations","pretransplant renovascular assessment","accurate method","effective imaging method","mind","METHODS","mean age","Computed tomography angiography","center","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVES","aim","years"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS A total of nine trials involving 4912 participants met our inclusion criteria, of which five were about colorectal cancer screening, three were about prostate cancer screening and one was about lung cancer screening. Five of the nine trials showed that pamphlets alone increased uptake significantly, while the remaining four trials did not show significant effects.

OBJECTIVE We sought to analyze the value of the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) in predicting lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) progression and mortality in a prospective cohort of consecutive adult (\u003E 16 years) allo-HSCT recipients with EvRh infection from December 1 2013 to December 1 2019 at two Spanish transplant centers. RESULTS We included 234 allo-HSCT recipients with 383 EvRh episodes. Out of 383 EvRh episodes, 98 (25%) had LRTD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent factors associated with LRTD progression: Ig G \u003C400 mg/dl, community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) co-infection and high-risk ISI. Inclusion of Ig G levels and CARV co-infection in the ISI improved its performance by significantly increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.643 to 0.734 (p= 0.03). Likewise, the two conditions identified by multivariate analyses as associated with higher probability of mortality were high-risk ISI and EvRh infection within 6 months after transplant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings confirm the value of high-risk ISI in predicting both probability of EvRh LRTD and 3-month overall mortality. We also demonstrate that the original ISI could be adapted to other CARV types by including additional variables to improve its performance.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez, Ariadna; Montoro, Juan; Hernani, Rafael; Lorenzo, Ignacio; Hern\u00E1ndez-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Gim\u00E9nez, Estela; G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Balaguer-Rosell\u00F3, Aitana; Gonzalez-Barber\u00E1, Eva; Guerreiro, Manuel; Aguilar, Crist\u00F3bal; Navarro, David; Solano, Carlos; Sanz, Jaime; Luis Pi\u00F1ana, Jos\u00E9","journal":"Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTD","ISI","Ig G","CARV","EvRh LRTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EvRh infection","probability of EvRh LRTD","EvRh episodes","value of high-risk ISI","original ISI","CARV co-infection","LRTD progression","allo-HSCT recipients","higher probability of mortality","CARV types","predicting","performance","month overall mortality","common cause of respiratory virus infections","lower respiratory tract disease","Inclusion of Ig G levels","multivariate analyses","recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation","Spanish transplant centers","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","independent factors","receiver operator characteristic curve","area","prospective cohort of consecutive adult","years","AUROC","additional variables","index","findings","months","BACKGROUND Enterovirus","rhinoviruses","immunodeficiency","community","conditions","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Control of COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide public health problem that governments and individuals must overcome. Recently, infection cluster occurred in a call center located in Seoul. The Ministry of Employment and Labor has decided to support call center companies use the cost of installing partitions, air purifiers, hand sanitizers and masks to prevent droplet and aerosol infections. Air purifiers are expected to be installed on the floor and exhaust stayed on the higher level such as desk or breathing zone of worker. When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague\u0027s respiratory system, the droplets can spread throughout the call center space through the air flow. If there is only one infected person, there is a chance that the infection cluster will increase. Installation of air purifiers may cause new problems, so the control to prevent infection should not lead to a new infection. Therefore, using the air purifier to control the COVID-19 should be approached with caution.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ham, Seunghon","journal":"Epidemiology and health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","The Ministry of Employment and Labor"],"locations":["Seoul"],"keyphrases":["Installation of air purifiers","air flow","new infection","infection cluster","Control of COVID","highest level","center companies","center space","outbreak of COVID","releases droplets","new problems","higher level","worker coughs","zone of worker","public health problem","World Health Organization","highest infectious-disease alert","masks","partitions","hand sanitizers","colleague\u0027s respiratory system","governments","cost","individuals","desk","chance","aerosol infections","exhaust","Korean government","Labor","Ministry of Employment","infected person","floor","Phase","pandemic","Seoul","caution"],"language":"en"},

Thus, screening the severe/critical cases before symptom occurs effectively saves medical resources. METHODS AND MATERIALS In this study, all 336 cases of patients infected COVID-19 in Shanghai to March 12th, were retrospectively enrolled, and divided in to training and test datasets. In addition, 220 clinical and laboratory observations/records were also collected. Clinical indicators were associated with severe/critical symptoms were identified and a model for severe/critical symptom prediction was developed. RESULTS Totally, 36 clinical indicators significantly associated with severe/critical symptom were identified. The clinical indicators are mainly thyroxine, immune related cells and products. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and optimized combination of age, GSH, CD3 ratio and total protein has a good performance in discriminating the mild and severe/critical cases. The area under receiving operating curve (AUROC) reached 0.9996 and 0.9757 in the training and testing dataset, respectively. When the using cut-off value as 0.0667, the recall rate was 93.33 % and 100 % in the training and testing datasets, separately. Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators. CONCLUSION The model was robust and effective in predicting the severe/critical COVID cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Liping; Song, Fengxiang; Shi, Nannan; Liu, Fengjun; Li, Shenyang; Li, Ping; Zhang, Weihan; Jiang, Xiao; Zhang, Yongbin; Sun, Lining; Chen, Xiong; Shi, Yuxin","journal":"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["critical cases","critical COVID cases","critical symptoms","fatality rate of severe","critical symptom prediction","selected clinical indicators","model","training","cases of patients infected COVID","death rate of COVID","recall rate","testing datasets","test datasets","GSH","SVM","optimized combination of age","total protein","CD3 ratio","thyroxine","good performance","survival analyses","immune related cells","information","Cox multivariate regression","Support Vector Machine","products","laboratory observations","study","World Health Organization","area","operating curve","AUROC","Shanghai","CONCLUSION","addition","records","BACKGROUND","cut-off value","medical resources","METHODS","MATERIALS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The scoping review followed the York framework and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase and CINAHL were searched using key terms. Screening and selection were conducted by two independent reviewers. A standardized, pilot-tested form was used for extracting data, which were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS The review included 211 studies, originating from 29 countries, with the USA (18.8%) and China (12.26%) as leading contributors. Thirty-four different terms for structural endplate defects were reported, but were never defined in most studies (65%). Of the 34 different terms used, some appeared to represent the same phenomenon, while the same terms were occasionally defined differently between studies. Schmorl\u0027s nodes were most commonly investigated (n = 99 studies) and defined similarly across studies, with the main difference relating to whether the indentation (node) was required to have a sclerotic margin. There were also similarities in definitions for endplate sclerosis. However, there was great variability in the definitions of other terms, such as lesions, irregularities, abnormalities, erosions and changes. CONCLUSION With the possible exception of Schmorl\u0027s nodes, we lack a common language for effectively communicating structural endplate findings. This review provides a foundation and impetus for standardizing terminology and core measures to improve communication and synthesis of the growing body of endplate research to advance related knowledge.

Patients were categorised according to use patterns of statins during this early in-hospital phase (continuation, discontinuation or new initiation of statins). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to explore the association between early statin exposure and functional outcome. Results A total of 919 patients were included in the analysis. Early in-hospital statin exposure (n = 89, 9.7%) was associated with better functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \u2264 3) compared with 790 patients without statin exposure before or early after the event (66% versus 47%, adjusted OR 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.6). Compared with patients without exposure to statins before and early after the event, early continuation of statin therapy (n = 57) was associated with favourable functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.2). The association between early continuation of statins and outcome remained robust in sensitivity analyses restricted to patients able to take oral medication within 72 h and one-week survivors. Discussion It is possible that part of the observed associations are not due to a protective effect of statins but are confounded by indication bias. Conclusion Statin exposure and continuation of prevalent statin therapy early after intracerebral haemorrhage are associated with favourable functional outcome after 90 days.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doerrfuss, Jakob I; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Siegerink, Bob; Nolte, Christian H; Lees, Kennedy R; Endres, Matthias; Kasner, Scott E; Scheitz, Jan F","journal":"European stroke journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987319889258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early statin exposure","early continuation of statin therapy","early continuation of statins","hospital statin exposure","early continuation of prevalent statin use","Conclusion Statin exposure","effects of early","continuation of prevalent statin therapy","favourable functional outcome","better functional outcome","patients able","intracerebral haemorrhage","use patterns of statins","hospital phase","new initiation of statins","protective effect of statins","methods Data","event","confidence interval","Introduction Recent data","acute phase","sensitivity analyses","multivariable analyses","adjusted odds ratio","discontinuation","modified Rankin Scale","Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive","oral medication","days","observed associations","week survivors","indication bias","Discussion","total","analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness. METHODS This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods - permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) - as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. RESULTS The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p\u003C0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The \u0027coordinate value\u0027 in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA. CONCLUSIONS Multi-dimensional measurements, especially the PE, SampEn, PLZC, and DFA, when combined with GA-SVM, are promising methods for constructing a framework to quantify consciousness.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Zhenhu; Shao, Shuai; Lv, Zhe; Li, Duan; Sleigh, Jamie W; Li, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chongyang; He, Jianghong","journal":"IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2020.2964819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31940541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCS","NWC","DFA","PLZC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["states of consciousness","content of consciousness","altered consciousness","disorders of consciousness","levels of consciousness","SampEn","PLZC","normal waking consciousness","Altered contents of consciousness","GA-SVM","DFA","integration of PE","MCS","general anesthesia","non-linear measures PE","coma","following states","dimensions of level","systematic framework","non-linear methods - permutation entropy","multivariable linear regression model","EEG indices","patients","NWC","EEG recordings","promising methods","extracted features","study","multi-dimensional index","sample entropy","normal wakefulness","CONCLUSIONS Multi-dimensional measurements","RP of Gamma","permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity","genetic algorithm-based support vector machine","healthy participants","important issue","neuroscience research","random forest","neural networks","frontal channels","conscious state","clinical practice","detrended fluctuation analysis","electroencephalography","highest classification accuracy","relative power","coordinate value","contrast","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The nonstructural polyprotein (nsP) is processed by its nsP2 cysteine protease to produce active enzymes essential for viral replication. Viral proteases are highly specific and recognize conserved cleavage site motif sequences (~6-8 amino acids). In several Group IV viruses, the nsP protease(s) cleavage site motif sequences can be found in specific host proteins involved in generating the innate immune responses and, in some cases, the targeted proteins appear to be linked to the virus-induced phenotype. These viruses utilize short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) for targeted destruction of host proteins. To identify SSHHPS the viral protease cleavage site motif sequences can be inputted into BLAST and the host genome(s) can be searched. Cleavage initially can be tested using the purified nsP viral protease and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates made in E. coli. The FRET substrates contain cyan and yellow fluorescent protein and the cleavage site sequence (CFP-sequence-YFP). This protease assay can be used continuously in a plate reader or discontinuously in SDS-PAGE gels. Models of the bound peptide substrates can be generated in silico to guide substrate selection and mutagenesis studies. CFP/YFP substrates have also been utilized to identify protease inhibitors. These in vitro and in silico methods can be used in combination with cell-based assays to determine if the targeted host protein affects viral replication.","publish_time":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Xin; Compton, Jaimee R; Legler, Patricia M","journal":"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3791/60421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral protease cleavage site motif sequences","nsP protease","purified nsP viral protease","cleavage site sequence","targeted host protein","viral replication","protease assay","protease inhibitors","conserved cleavage site motif sequences","specific host proteins","host genome","FRET substrates","Viral proteases","targeted destruction of host proteins","targeted proteins","YFP substrates","nsP2 cysteine protease","short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences","SSHHPS","CFP-sequence","viruses","bound peptide substrates","yellow fluorescent protein","Alphaviral enzymes","silico methods","active enzymes essential","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","combination","BLAST","substrate selection","cell-based assays","cases","innate immune responses","mutagenesis studies","SDS-PAGE gels","Models","Group","plate reader","single polypeptide","virus-induced phenotype","nonstructural polyprotein","coli","amino acids"],"language":"en"},

This systematic review assesses current practice within preterm birth clinics globally. METHODS A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify all studies on preterm birth clinics on the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases. There were no restrictions to study design. Studies were limited to the English language and publications from 1998 onwards. Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion, performed data extraction and reviewed methodological quality. Primary outcomes were referral criteria, investigations and interventions offered in preterm birth clinics. Secondary outcomes were the timing of planned first and last appointments and frequency of review. RESULTS Thirty-two records fulfilled eligibility criteria and 20 studies were included in the main analysis following grouping of records describing the same study or clinic. Studies were of mixed study design and methodological quality. A total of 39 clinics were described; outcome data was not available for all clinics. Referral criteria included previous spontaneous preterm birth (38/38, 100%), previous mid-trimester loss (34/38, 89%) and previous cervical surgery (33/38, 87%). All clinics offered transvaginal cervical length scans. Additional investigations varied, including urogenital swabs (16/28, 57%) and fetal fibronectin (8/28, 29%). The primary treatment of choice for a sonographic short cervix was cervical cerclage in 10/33 (30%) clinics and vaginal progesterone in 6/33 (18%), with 10/33 (30%) using multiple first-line options and 6/33 (18%) using a combination of treatments. The majority of clinics planned timing of first review for 12-16 weeks (30/35, 86%) and the frequency of review was usually determined by clinical findings (18/24, 75%). There was a wide variation in gestational age at clinic discharge between 24 and 37 weeks. CONCLUSIONS There is variation in the referral criteria, investigations and interventions offered in preterm birth clinics and in the timing and frequency of review. Consistency in practice may improve with the introduction of consensus guidelines and national preterm birth prevention programmes.

The origin of the outbreak at the animal market in Wuhan, China implies it as a case of zoonotic spillover. The study was designed to understand evolution of Betacoronaviruses and in particular diversification of SARS-CoV-2 using RdRp gene, a stable genetic marker. METHODS Phylogenetic and population stratification analyses were carried out using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, respectively. RESULTS Molecular phylogeny using RdRp, showed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates cluster together. Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoVs are observed to branch off prior to SARS-CoV-2 cluster. While SARS-CoV form a single cluster, Bat-CoVs form multiple clusters. Population-based analyses revealed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV form separate clusters with no admixture. Bat-CoVs were found to have single and mixed ancestry and clustered as four sub-populations. CONCLUSIONS Population-based analyses of Betacoronaviruses using RdRp, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is a homogeneous population. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have evolved from Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13, which diversified from a common ancestor from which Pangolin-CoVs have also evolved. The admixed Bat-CoV sub-populations indicate that bats serve as reservoirs harboring virus ensembles that are responsible for zoonotic spillovers such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The extent of admixed isolates of Bat-CoVs observed in population diversification studies underline the need for periodic surveillance of bats and other animal reservoirs for potential spillovers as a measure towards preparedness for emergence of zoonosis.

To update prevalence estimates for self-reported hypertension and use of antihypertensive medication, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The overall (unadjusted) prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 32.1%-32.7%). The age-standardized, median state-specific prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 29.7% (range = 24.3%-38.6%). Overall age-standardized hypertension prevalence was higher among men (32.9%) than among women (27.0%), highest among blacks (40.0%), decreased with increasing levels of education and household income, and was generally highest in the Southeastern and Appalachian states.* Among persons reporting hypertension, the overall unadjusted prevalence of self-reported antihypertensive medication use was 76.0% (95% CI = 75.5%-76.4%).

Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19.Patients and methods - We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO\u0027s web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be. A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice. Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks. Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available. Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basso, Trude; Dale, H\u00E5vard; Langvatn, H\u00E5kon; L\u00F8nne, Greger; Skr\u00E5mm, Inge; Westberg, Marianne; Wik, Tina S; Wits\u00F8, Eivind","journal":"Acta orthopaedica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2020.1764234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Orthopedic surgery","suspected COVID","purpose - COVID","relevant publications","procedures","aerosols","patients","PPE","shortage of personal protective equipment","Interpretation - Surgical masks","consistent use of personal protective equipment","relevant knowledge","shedding of droplets","possibility of transmission","SARS-CoV","SARS epidemic","perioperative practice","considerable problem","clinical practice","lack of studies","lack of scientific evidence","healthcare workers","WHO\u0027s web page","practical recommendations","problems","infectious viruses","reference lists","narrative review attempts","P3","respirator","N95","surgeons","reports","visor","rational precautionary principles","FFP2","PubMed","basic measures","literature","specific search","Seal-leakage","methods","impactful pandemics","society","combination","Background"],"language":"en"},

We sought to use Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in the Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. METHODS GT was used to explore Internet activity related to loss of smell in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss of smell relative search volumes (RSV) with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK Influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS In all three countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID-19\u002B cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p\u003C0.05). CONCLUSION There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands.

However, most of the DoA monitors do not include brain activity signal modeling. Here, we propose a new algorithm termed the cortical activity index (CAI) based on the brain activity signals. In this study, we enrolled 32 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 128 Hz using BIS-VISTA with standard bispectral index (BIS) sensors. All data were stored on a computer for further analysis. The similarities and difference among spectral entropy, the BIS, and CAI were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient between the BIS and CAI was 0.825. The result of fitting the semiparametric regression models is the method CAI estimate (-0.00995; P = .0341). It is the estimated difference in the mean of the dependent variable between method BIS and CAI. The CAI algorithm, a simple and intuitive algorithm based on brain activity signal modeling, suggests an intrinsic relationship between the DoA and the EEG waveform. We suggest that the CAI algorithm might be used to quantify the DoA.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huh, Hyub; Park, Sang-Hyun; Yu, Joon Ho; Hong, Jisu; Lee, Mee Ju; Cho, Jang Eun; Lim, Choon Hak; Lee, Hye Won; Kim, Jun Beom; Yang, Kyung-Sook; Yoon, Seung Zhoo","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000018441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32000357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["BIS","CAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CAI algorithm","method BIS","method CAI estimate","BIS-VISTA","brain activity signals","brain activity signal modeling","intuitive algorithm","new algorithm","DoA monitors","cortical activity index","depth of anesthesia","general anesthesia","estimated difference","EEG waveform","standard bispectral index","semiparametric regression models","dependent variable","mean","Hz","intrinsic relationship","intraoperative awareness","spectral entropy","sampling rate","sensors","Pearson correlation coefficient","patients","result","similarities","Raw electroencephalography","Various methods","computer","laparoscopic cholecystectomy","data","analysis","study","anesthesiology"],"language":"en"},

A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world\u0027s health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases. Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Xiao-Rong; Clifton, David; Ji, Nan; Lovell, Nigel Hamilton; Bonato, Paolo; Chen, Wei; Yu, Xinge; Xue, Zhong; Xiang, Ting; Long, Xi; Xu, Ke; Jiang, Xinyu; Wang, Qi; Yin, Bin; Feng, Guodong; Zhang, Yuanting","journal":"IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2020.2992838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","world\u0027s health systems","telehealth technologies","unobtrusive sensing systems","monitoring patients","remote monitoring","Coronavirus disease","pandemic","article","tackling disease emergence","clinical situation","improvised hospitals","vulnerable populations","related diseases","diseases prevention","health status of caregivers","serious clinical manifestations","places extraordinary demands","management personnel","spread","mild symptoms","various application scenarios","triage processes","opportunities","admission","death","future directions of development","global communities","wearable devices suitable","frontline","vaccines","unprecedented way","challenges","strategy","risk","quarantine","tremendous efforts","treatments","objective","crisis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The analysis was based on data collected in May 2013 in the ED of Recanto das Emas, Federal District, Brasil, which uses a Manchester Triage System. A total of 100 consecutive patients were included: 70 yellow (70%) and 30 green (30%). Flow patterns, observed waiting time, and inter-arrival times of patients were collected. Process maps, demand, and capacity data were used to build a simulation, which was calibrated against the observed flow times. What-if analysis was conducted to reduce waiting times. RESULTS Green and yellow patient arrival-time patterns were similar, but inter-arrival times were 5 and 38 minutes, respectively. Wait-time was 14 minutes for yellow patients, and 4 hours for green patients. The physician staff comprised four doctors per shift. A simulation predicted that allocating one more doctor per shift would reduce wait-time to 2.5 hours for green patients, with a small impact in yellow patients\u0027 wait-time. Maintaining four doctors and allocating one doctor exclusively for green patients would reduce the waiting time to 1.5 hours for green patients and increase it in 15 minutes for yellow patients. The best simulation scenario employed five doctors per shift, with two doctors exclusively for green patients. CONCLUSION Waiting times can be reduced by balancing the allocation of doctors to green and yellow patients and matching the availability of doctors to forecasted demand patterns. Simulations of EDs\u0027 can be used to generate and test solutions to decrease overcrowding.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amorim, F\u00E1bio Ferreira; Almeida, Karlo Jozefo Quadros de; Barbalho, Sanderson Cesar Macedo; Balieiro, Vanessa de Amorim Teixeira; Machado Neto, Arnaldo; Dias, Guilherme de Freitas; Santana, Levy Aniceto; Aguiar, Cristhiane Pinheiro Teixeira Gico de; Silva, Cl\u00E1udia Cardoso Gomes da; Dasu, Sriram","journal":"Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.65.12.1476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31994629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Departments","Manchester Triage System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["green patients","waiting time of patients","consecutive patients","inter-arrival times of patients","wait-time","waiting times","RESULTS Green","yellow patient arrival-time patterns","yellow patients\u0027","availability of doctors","allocation of doctors","demand patterns","hours","shift","minutes","observed flow times","simulation tools","Flow patterns","best simulation scenario","analysis","capacity data","Simulations of EDs","use of forecasting models","small impact","Brasil","Emas","Emergency Departments","Federal District","ED of Recanto","Process maps","OBJECTIVE","physician staff","Manchester Triage System","test solutions","overcrowding","METHODS","total","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

To probe the action of biochar on soil aggregates, a 5-year field experiment was implemented in the brown earth soil of northeastern China. We determined the aggregate distribution (\u003E 2000 \u03BCm, 250-2000 \u03BCm, 53-250 \u03BCm, and \u003C 53 \u03BCm) and organic carbon (OC) and organo-mineral complex contents both in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and within the soil aggregates. Three treatments were studied as follows: control (basal application of mineral NPK fertilizer), biochar (biochar applied at a rate of 2.625 t ha-1), and stover (maize stover applied at a rate of 7.5 t ha-1), and all treatments received the same fertilization. The biochar and stover applications decreased the soil bulk and particle densities significantly (p \u003C 0.05) and enhanced the soil total porosity. Both amendments significantly (p \u003C 0.05) enhanced the total OC, heavy OC fractions, and organo-mineral complex quantities in the bulk soil as well as in all the studied aggregate fractions. Biochar and stover applications promoted the formation of small macroaggregates. A greater amount of organic matter was contained in the macroaggregates, which led to the formation of more organo-mineral complexes, thereby improving soil aggregate stability. However, the different mechanisms underlying the effect of biochar and stover on organo-mineral complexes need further research. Biochar and stover applications are both effective methods of improving the soil structure in Northeast China.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Qiang; Meng, Jun; Sarkar, Binoy; Lan, Yu; Lin, Li; Li, Haifeng; Yang, Xu; Yang, Tiexin; Chen, Wenfu; Wang, Hailong","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08171-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northeast China","China"],"keyphrases":["soil structure","soil bulk","bulk soil","soil aggregates","soil aggregate stability","stover applications","effect of biochar","action of biochar","influence of biochar","soil total porosity","\u03BCm","organo-mineral complexes","maize stover","organo-mineral complex quantities","organo-mineral complex contents","brown earth soil of northeastern China","studied aggregate fractions","total OC","aggregate distribution","heavy OC fractions","rate","t ha","treatments","basal application of mineral NPK fertilizer","formation of small macroaggregates","organic carbon","organic matter","Northeast China","effective methods","control","particle densities","year field experiment","different mechanisms","topsoil","research","previous studies","fertilization","amendments"],"language":"en"},

Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term.

To test our assumptions, some important biochemical properties and functions of LLP12 domain were studied. The recombinant peptide LLP12 (LLP12 domain on gp41, including LLP1 and LLP2 domains) was prepared via bacterial expression system. Biochemical analysis directly demonstrated its multimeric potential and membrane\u2010binding ability. Several arginine residues in this domain were observed to be extremely highly conserved. Interestingly, the LLP12 mutants constructed by substitution of these arginine residues with alanine (separate mutations in LLP1 or LLP2 or both) showed apparent decreases in their multimeric potential and membrane\u2010binding ability. Comparing our results with independent data on human immunodeficiency virus from other researchers, it appears that both the multimeric state and the membrane affinity of the LLP12 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 could be involved in viral competence and in the mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env\u2010mediated cell fusion.","publish_time":"2007-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Yun; Lu, Lu; Chao, Lijun; Chen, Ying\u2010Hua","journal":"Chem Biol Drug Des","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eb901301f9bce7313b359bd2a72c46034352d47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LLP12 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type","functions of LLP12 domain","LLP12 mutants","mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type","recombinant peptide LLP12","gp41","mutated virus","multimeric potential","membrane affinity","multimeric state","Biochemical analysis","binding ability","arginine residues","viral competence","certain biochemical aspects","important biochemical properties","conserved cytoplasmic region","LLP2 domains","separate mutations","Env","alanine","mediated cell fusion","substitution","independent data","impaired infectivity","apparent decreases","results","bacterial expression system","assumptions","researchers"],"language":"en"},

From serious pandemics and highly contagious infections to common influenza episodes, clinical prognosis often relies on early detection of the infectious agent. Thus, effective identification of viral pathogens is needed to help prevent transmission, set up appropriate therapy, monitor response to treatment and lead to efficient disease management and control. The aim of this review is to outline some of the recent technological advances in viral identification, including polymerase chain reaction, mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing, and how they are applied in the diagnosis and management of viral infections. These powerful tools combine rapidity and efficiency in detecting viral pathogens and have revolutionized the field of clinical diagnostics. However, a number of drawbacks such as high cost have limited their use in many laboratories, particularly in resource-limited settings.

By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers\u0027 changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders.

SUMMARY: Attemps to develop an immunoprophylaxis for transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection in pigs IV. Growth and excretion of the vaccine virus TGE Bl\u2010300 after vaccination of sows and feeder pigs The TGE virus vaccine strain Bl\u2010300 grows in the middle and distal part of the jejunum of adult pigs after oral vaccination. Excretion of the vaccine virus via faeces and nasal secretions could not be demonstrated. Transmission of the virus did not occur either from three vaccinated sows to their newborn offspring or from 78 twice vaccinated feeder pigs to contact animals. In addition, virus could not be isolated in cell cultures from faeces of vaccinated pigs.

With the expected exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), the prospect of regional disintegration has brought about a new impetus to studying trade policy effects. Using actual and forecast data for a panel of bilateral imports between the EU15 and the rest of the world, this paper examines the trade effects of EU economic integration agreements (EIAs), their evolution over time and the related counterfactual Brexit trade policy scenarios. Distinct trade effects are obtained for the EU trade related agreements; positive, significant and of similar magnitude for the EU and free trade agreement (FTA) coefficients, but negative and significant (and smaller in magnitude) for the regional economic partnership agreements (EPAs). The subperiod results suggest the positive coefficients of EU and FTA membership tend to diminish over time, implying earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits. Finally, in generating the predicted values for the trade effects of three alternative counterfactual Brexit scenarios (hard Brexit, hard Brexit plus, global Britain), the findings suggest an asymmetric effect depending on the perspective of the UK versus the EU.

PathOGiST uses different genotypic signals, clusters the isolates based on these individual signals with correlation clustering, and combines the clusterings based on the individual signals through consensus clustering.

However, it is difficult to distinguish these patients in the early stage. The present study was to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients, analyze related factors and explore predictive markers of the disease aggravation. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of non-severe adult COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, were collected and analyzed on admission. A logistic regression model was adopted to analyze the association between the disease aggravation and related factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was utilized to analyze the prognostic ability of C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: About 7.7% (16/209) non-severe adult COVID-19 patients progressed to severe cases after admission. Compared with non-severe patients, the aggravated patients had much higher levels of CRP (median, 43.8 mg/L [range: 12.3-101.9] vs 12.1 mg/L [range: 0.1-91.4]; P = 0.000). The regression analysis showed CRP was significantly associated with the aggravation of non-severe COVID-19 patients, with an area under the curves (AUC) of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.761 - 0.926) and the optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: CRP could be a valuable marker to anticipate the possibility of aggravation of non-severe adult COVID-19 patients, with the optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Guyi; Wu, Chenfang; Zhang, Quan; Wu, Fang; Yu, Bo; Lv, Jianlei; Li, Yiming; Li, Tiao; Zhang, Siye; Wu, Chao; Wu, Guobao; Zhong, Yanjun","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ce7ea950f08e9cb13b125f0c240e36d5ef5e989.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","CRP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["non-severe patients","aggravation of non-severe COVID","aggravated patients","severe cases","laboratory data of non-severe adult COVID","disease aggravation","possibility of aggravation","Clinical findings","clinical characteristics","related factors","higher levels of CRP","optimal threshold value","admission","range","fraction of Corona Virus Disease","early stage","regression analysis","logistic regression model","reactive protein","predictive markers","prognostic ability of C","valuable marker","association","Changsha","Receiver","characteristic curve","ROC","METHODS","median","area","CONCLUSIONS","present study","curves","AUC","BACKGROUND","vs","China","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The institutions serve populations poorly-served by traditional commercial banks, helping customers invest in microenterprises, save, and maintain liquidity. We report results from \u2018rapid response\u2019 phone surveys of about 1,000 microenterprise owners, a survey of about 200 microfinance loan officers, and interviews with regulators and senior representatives of microfinance institutions. We ran these surveys starting about a week after the country went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. We find that, on average, week-on-week sales and household income both fell by about 90%. Households\u2019 primary immediate concern in early April became how to secure food. As a result, 70% of the sample of current microfinance borrowers reported that they could not repay their loans; loan officers anticipated a repayment rate of just 34% in April 2020.

For these queries only data that strictly respect all user\u2019s conditions is returned. XML documents are generally semi-structured. Due to the non-existence or lack of knowledge of the model of the document being queried, when exact queries are used, there is a high risk of obtaining an empty result (in the case of too specific queries) or too large (in the case of too vague queries). In contrast to exact queries, requests with preferences aim to return only the most relevant results in order to avoid empty or too important results as much as possible. To achieve this goal, requests with preferences generally consist of two parts: the first part is used to express strict constraints and the second part to express preferences or wishes. The satisfaction of both parts increases the relevance of the corresponding results. This paper presents XQuery preference, an extension of the XQuery language, that allows to express requests with preferences relating to both the values and the structure of an XML document. A representation model of such requests based on the Generalized Tree Pattern (GTP) model is also proposed in order to allow an evaluation of these requests through a tree pattern matching process. Integration of the proposed language in open source implementations of XQuery like BaseX, Berkeley DB XML, eXist-db, Galax and much more, will allow users to get much more relevant responses to their concerns.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchoup\u00E9 Tchendji, Maurice; Kenfack, Patrik Joslin","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17a39488db7012b30032b7161c2f7c745e4a3b05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Berkeley DB XML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["requests","exact queries","preferences","specific queries","vague queries","XQuery language","XML documents","exact query","relevant results","Berkeley DB XML","XQuery preference","proposed language","case","representation model","order","important results","corresponding results","parts","Generalized Tree Pattern","open source implementations of XQuery","relational database","relevant responses","BaseX","extension","relevance","GTP","lack of knowledge","paper","Integration","structure","values","evaluation","process","contrast","high risk","user\u2019s conditions","non-existence","users","concerns","satisfaction","Galax","goal","strict constraints"],"language":"en"},

In the meanwhile, Fragmentation and Coagulation Process (FCP), a stochastic partition model, has recently been proposed for identifying dynamic customer groups and modeling their purchase behavior. However, FCP is not able to forecast the purchase behavior because such a data-driven method requires transaction observations to conduct clustering. To tackle this challenge, we propose FCP filter, a clustering-prediction framework based on FCP, which can forecast purchase behavior and filter random noise of individual transaction data. In our model, FCP clusters customers into groups by their temporal interests to filter random noise of individual transaction data. Then a predictor is built on grouped data. The predicted results are also fed to FCP to adjust the parameter for prior knowledge at the next time step. Our model is superior in capturing temporal dynamics and having flexible number of groups. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our model is able to discover the latent group of individual customers and provides accurate predictions for dynamic purchase behavior.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yuanzhe; Luo, Ling; Wang, Yang; Wang, Zhiyong","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deb5090e35e7f6eeeba9fccb0b1aefd80802dc39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206192.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCP filter","dynamic purchase behavior","Customer purchase behavior prediction","filter random noise of individual transaction data","FCP clusters customers","randomness of individual historic transaction data","grouped data","transaction observations","data-driven method","dynamic customer groups","latent group of individual customers","stochastic partition model","clustering-prediction framework","flexible number of groups","temporal dynamics","temporal interests","important role","accurate predictions","modern retailing","prior knowledge","real-world datasets","Coagulation Process","performance","experiments","time step","Fragmentation","parameter","task","predictor","predicted results","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, KB canonicalization i.e, mapping multiple references of same entities into unique clusters is imperative for online recruitment platforms. Research suggests various approaches that use enriched semantic context or external context (from sources like Freebase) to perform KB Canonicalization. In fields where such external sources of context do not exist the problem remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep Siamese architecture with character-based attention and word embeddings that (a) estimates pairwise similarity between all entity mentions, and (b) then uses these similarity (scores) to create canonical clusters representing unique entity in the KB. Our experiments on recruitment domain dataset comprising of 62,288 unique entities of various types such as companies, institutes, skills, and designations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the owners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or share their data with other organisations to allow such similarity calculations. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving encoding technique that can be used to securely calculate similarities between sensitive values held in different databases.

To address these questions, we propose Sparsified Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN), a neural network graph sparsifier that sparsifies a graph by pruning some edges. We formulate sparsification as an optimization problem, which we solve by an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based solution.

The solutions to UIL problem facilitate cross-platform research on OSN users and enable many useful applications such as user profiling and recommendation. As the UIL labeled data are often lacking and costly to obtain, learning user embeddings for matching user identities using an unsupervised approach is therefore highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised UIL framework for enhancing existing user embedding-based UIL methods. Our proposed framework incorporates two key ideas, user-discriminative features and retrofitting embedding. The user-discriminative features enable us to differentiate a specific user identity from other users in its OSN. From the user-discriminative features, we derive pairs of similar user identities across OSNs for retrofitting the base user embeddings of existing UIL methods. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our framework can leverage user-discriminative features to improve the accuracy of different user embedding-based UIL methods significantly. The quantum of improvement can also be surprisingly good even for existing UIL methods with very poor matching accuracy.

For instance, item sales can be aggregated temporally, and over groups of stores based on their location or affiliation. However, data in finer granularity significantly benefit forecasting and data analytics, prompting increasing interest in data disaggregation methods.

Tendi employs coupled tensor factorization to fuse the multiple views and provide recovery guarantees under realistic conditions.

METHODS: Forty cats aged between 2 months and 11 years old (median 6 months) that were definitively diagnosed with rhodococcosis between 2012 and 2018 were recruited in this study. Medical records were reviewed for information on signalment, history, clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, treatment plans and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 40 cats, 36 showed the pulmonary form of the disease, with 35 (87.5%) presented with dyspnoea, while four cats presented with only cutaneous lesions. Mean body temperature was 38.7 \u00B1 0.2(\u00B0)C. Dyspnoea was noted in 87.5% of the cats. Leukocytosis (58.3%) with band neutrophilia (83.3%), monocytosis (58.3%) and thrombocytopenia (55.5%) were prominent findings in the haematology reports. Hyperproteinaemia (61.1%) with hypoalbuminaemia (22.2%) and hyperglobulinaemia (63.8%) with a low albumin to globulin ratio (38.9%) were prominent features of blood biochemistry reports. An alveolar\u2013interstitial pattern was noted in 75% of pre-thoracocentesis radiographs. Pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, thoracic lymphadenopathy and atelectasis of any lung lobe were seen in 88.9%, 75%, 41.7% and 36.1% of cats, respectively. Overall, the mortality rate was 67.5% in both forms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinicians should be aware that feline rhodococcosis manifests as a pulmonary disease at a much higher rate than previously reported. Further studies are required to address the epidemiology, pathophysiology, disease management and prognosis of feline rhodococcosis. The role of immunosuppression as a predisposing factor in feline rhodococcosis requires further investigation.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aslam, Muhammad Waseem; Lau, Seng Fong; Chin, Chelly Sze Lee; Ahmad, Nur Indah; Rahman, Nor-Alimah; Kuppusamy, Krishnammah; Omar, Sharina; Radzi, Rozanaliza","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94fd6167b38f2b59fa288d2460cb48bcdb81e5a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206563.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhodococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cats","prognosis of feline rhodococcosis","feline rhodococcosis manifests","clinical outcomes","pulmonary disease","clinical presentation","clinical manifestations","disease management","months","dyspnoea","prominent features of blood biochemistry reports","diagnostic testing","diagnostic options","radiological features","treatment plans","therapeutic plans","prominent findings","pulmonary form","haematology reports","retrospective study","higher rate","mortality rate","thoracic lymphadenopathy","history","predisposing factor","atelectasis","hepatomegaly","information","signalment","Clinicians","Pleural effusion","epidemiology","pathophysiology","years old","lung lobe","globulin ratio","role of immunosuppression","low albumin","RELEVANCE","Rhodococcus equi","investigation","Medical records","hypoalbuminaemia","band neutrophilia","Mean body temperature","interstitial pattern","pre-thoracocentesis radiographs","monocytosis","CONCLUSIONS","thrombocytopenia","OBJECTIVES","cutaneous lesions","Hyperproteinaemia","hyperglobulinaemia","Leukocytosis","studies","forms","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The results proved for the model include a hierarchy for cdfat with real-time heads, simulation of 1w/1w cdfat by 1w/rt cdfat, lower bounds of resources provided to a cdfat in order to make it powerful enough to recognize any language, utilizable advice limit regardless of the allowed pass limit, a relation between utilizable pass limit and advice limit, and some closure properties.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"U\u00E7an, Ahmet Bilal","journal":"Language and Automata Theory and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64da240d834ad271f8500244a663824560f74ee8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["w cdfat","utilizable advice limit","advice tape","allowed pass limit","rt cdfat","utilizable pass limit","input head","non-uniform model of computation","order","function of input length","input multiple times","number of allowed passes","circular deterministic finite automaton","relation","lower bounds of resources","real-time heads","simulation","typical property","form of strings","hierarchy","language","feasible computational models","uniformity","External assistance","closure properties","main contribution","paper","extension","K\u00FC\u00E7\u00FCk","limitations","results","Automata"],"language":"en"},

With increasing automation, autonomous agents are expected to take over a lot of this interaction process. Much of automated negotiation literature focuses on agents having a static and known reservation value. In situations involving dynamic environments e.g., an agent negotiating on behalf of a human regarding a meeting, agents can have a reservation value (RV) that is a function of time. This leads to a different set of challenges that may need additional reasoning about the concession behavior. In this paper, we build upon Negotiation algorithms such as ONAC (Optimal Non-Adaptive Concession) and Time-Dependent Techniques such as Boulware which work on settings where the reservation value of the agent is fixed and known. Although these algorithms can encode dynamic RV, their concession behavior and hence the properties they were expected to display would be different from when the RV is static, even though the underlying negotiation algorithm remains the same. We, therefore, propose to use one of Counter, Bayesian Learning with Regression Analysis or LSTM model on top of each algorithm to develop the PredictRV strategy and show that PredictRV indeed performs better on two different metrics tested on two different domains on a variety of parameter settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gear, Aditya Srinivas; Prakash, Kritika; Singh, Nonidh; Paruchuri, Praveen","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4816d5b2424a39f95ce14dfdb373d8a2cef3fd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215186.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONAC","LSTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Negotiation algorithms","known reservation value","concession behavior","different domains","different metrics","dynamic RV","underlying negotiation algorithm","autonomous agents","different set of challenges","automated negotiation literature","interaction process","Optimal Non-Adaptive Concession","function of time","dynamic environments","PredictRV strategy","Time-Dependent Techniques","variety of parameter settings","Regression Analysis","ONAC","Bayesian Learning","LSTM model","additional reasoning","important component","Counter","Boulware","meeting","behalf","increasing automation","humans","situations","lot","properties","paper"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is emerged as a respiratory infection and a suspicious origin of animals and transmission to human in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Later this, the virus was transmitted from person to person through droplets and contacts. The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China have taken immediate action to reduce transmission and fatality associated with COVID-19 as minimum as possible. However, action has failed to stop transmission of COVID-19 from China to other countries. Since there was no chain break of the virus, the chances are more to increase the case number and fatality. Hence, the study has been designed to perceive the current effect of COVID-19 on the global population and its fatality. The study also focused on review related to treatment for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online database of epidemic disease COVID-19 cases number was collected from www.channelnewsasia.com on 7(th) April 2020. This data was used to observe the past and present circumstances in the global population and its fatality. The effect of treatment on COVID-19 was reviewed from the few databases of clinical trials (antiviral and antibacterial drugs). RESULTS: The online data are used to observe a significant increase ratio of COVID-19 cases and its fatality rate in worldwide as well as country wise. The COVID-19 cases are high in the United States (27.5%), whereas the fatality rate is high in Italy (12.47%). The prevalence of COVID-19 is expected to be reaching 4 million by the end of April 2020 and the fatality rate also might be reached high. CONCLUSION: We have come to the conclusion that the effect of COVID-19 on the global population is significantly increased and the fatality rate also elevated (2.48% to 5.52%). The hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination treatment has shown significant improvement in patients with COVID-19 compared to treat with other drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palem, Siva Prasad; Palem, Hari Prasad","journal":"Indian J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a3e5ce6823f7013c84c82830a5b07012ec3c9a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":["China","Republic","United States"],"keyphrases":["transmission of COVID","prevalence of COVID","fatality rate","current effect of COVID","significant increase ratio of COVID","Online database of epidemic disease COVID","global population","effect of treatment","worldwide population","Disease Control","Coronavirus disease","cases number","current new virulent disease","person","CONCLUSION","study","People\u2019s Republic of China","significant improvement","immediate action","hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination treatment","case number","antibacterial drugs","National Health Commission","World Health Organization","Centers","Prevention","suspicious origin of animals","antiviral","METHODS","human","passing day","databases of clinical trials","present circumstances","Wuhan","patients","respiratory infection","chances","MATERIAL","droplets","contacts","United States","OBJECTIVE","review","Italy","chain break","RESULTS","minimum","country wise","countries","end"],"language":"en"},

However, most of our knowledge is built upon assuming pairwise relations among the system\u0027s components. This is often an oversimplification, for instance, in social interactions that occur frequently within groups. To overcome this limitation, here we study the dynamics of social contagion on hypergraphs. We develop an analytical framework and provide numerical results for arbitrary hypergraphs, which we also support with Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses show that the model has a vast parameter space, with first- and second-order transitions, bistability, and hysteresis. Phenomenologically, we also extend the concept of latent heat to social contexts, which might help understanding oscillatory social behaviors. Our work unfolds the research line of higher-order models and the analytical treatment of hypergraphs, posing new questions and paving the way for modeling dynamical processes on higher-order structures.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz; Petri, Giovanni; Moreno, Yamir","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b9b4fc7a0c40e56aab776cf0399cb1900149141.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social contexts","social interactions","dynamics of social contagion","order models","higher-order structures","analytical treatment of hypergraphs","order transitions","arbitrary hypergraphs","oscillatory social behaviors","understanding","analytical framework","research line of higher","dynamics of complex networked systems","way","modeling dynamical processes","new questions","numerical results","concept of latent heat","relations","vast parameter space","bistability","hysteresis","instance","Monte Carlo simulations","system\u0027s components","oversimplification","groups","knowledge","analyses","limitation","decades"],"language":"en"},

Within each theme, the authors describe the digital landscape, present and discuss their predictions, and identify relevant future research directions for academics and practitioners.","publish_time":"2019-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Appel, Gil; Grewal, Lauren; Hadi, Rhonda; Stephen, Andrew T.","journal":"J Acad Mark Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e84e0f3841d68b4352399cdab22e5c904d91f8fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222052.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["future of social media","authors","numerous ways social media","relevant future research directions","industry leaders","academic research","multiple ways","discussions","predictions","popular discourse","academics","businesses","individuals","lenses","themes","digital landscape","marketing-related topics","practitioners","predicted imminence","issues","marketers","public policy","article","people","futures","consumers"],"language":"en"},

However, few centers have started using these approaches with standard equipment because of the limited resources. We sought to report intra- and postoperative clinical outcomes and address health resource utilization after MIAVR. RESULTS: A total of 102 eligible patients who had aortic valve replacement were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted from June 2015 to December 2017. Fifty patients underwent aortic valve surgery via upper inverted T-shaped hemi-sternotomy (MS), and 52 patients were operated using full sternotomy (FS) in two centers in a developing country. Central cannulation was performed in all cases. Major adverse cardiac events, pain, and wound complications were compared. A cost analysis was performed, and exposure and feasibility for cannulation were assessed. The mean length of MS skin incision was 5.82 \u00B1 0.67 cm. Cumulative cross-clamp time was insignificant between both groups (91.87 \u00B1 34.41 versus 94.91 \u00B1 33.96 min; p = 0.66). MS exhibited shorter ventilation time (6.18 \u00B1 1.86 versus 10.68 \u00B1 12.78 h; p = 0.029) and intensive care stays (33.27 \u00B1 19.75 versus 49.42 \u00B1 47.1 h; p = 0.037). Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were compared, and MS group exhibited fewer transfusions (1.18 \u00B1 0.89 versus 1.7 \u00B1 0.97 units; p = 0.002), fewer pulmonary complications (1 (2%) versus 2 (3.8%); p \u003C 0.001), and less sternotomy wound infection (1 (2%) versus 5 (9.6%); p = 0.048). Total operative mortality of 4.46% was recorded (n = 5). Significant cost reduction was recorded favoring MS; central cannulation saved $907.16 and carried a total cost reduction of $580 (9.3%) when compared with the FS approach (p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: With a lack of logistics in developing countries, MIAVR not only has a cosmetic advantage but carries a significant reduction in blood use, respiratory complications, pain, and cost. MIAVR can be feasible, with a rapid learning curve in developing centers.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanad, Mohammed; Beshir, Hatem","journal":"Cardiothorac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae709e7bef10486c28ae6db8d35ba907b27ce611.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIAVR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MIAVR","total cost reduction","favoring MS","MS group","Significant cost reduction","developing centers","aortic valve replacement","significant reduction","wound complications","Central cannulation","cost analysis","aortic valve surgery","pain","respiratory complications","Major adverse cardiac events","eligible patients","developing countries","fewer pulmonary complications","sternotomy wound infection","developing country","mean length of MS skin incision","Total operative mortality","invasive approaches","fewer transfusions","FS approach","upper inverted T-shaped hemi-sternotomy","shorter ventilation time","Cumulative cross-clamp time","address health resource utilization","postoperative clinical outcomes","blood use","rapid learning curve","MACEs","lack of logistics","standard equipment","exposure","cosmetic advantage","limited resources","multicenter cohort study","groups","intensive care stays","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","feasibility","RESULTS","cases","units"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosis is often delayed, and disease tends to progress rapidly. Urgent surgical and medical intervention is lifesaving. Guidance on the complex multidisciplinary management has potential to improve prognosis, but approaches differ between health-care settings. From January, 2018, authors from 33 countries in all United Nations regions analysed the published evidence on mucormycosis management and provided consensus recommendations addressing differences between the regions of the world as part of the \u0022One World One Guideline\u0022 initiative of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM). Diagnostic management does not differ greatly between world regions. Upon suspicion of mucormycosis appropriate imaging is strongly recommended to document extent of disease and is followed by strongly recommended surgical intervention. First-line treatment with high-dose liposomal amphotericin B is strongly recommended, while intravenous isavuconazole and intravenous or delayed release tablet posaconazole are recommended with moderate strength. Both triazoles are strongly recommended salvage treatments. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is recommended against, because of substantial toxicity, but may be the only option in resource limited settings. Management of mucormycosis depends on recognising disease patterns and on early diagnosis. Limited availability of contemporary treatments burdens patients in low and middle income settings.

Recently, BCG vaccination was shown to correlate with reduced COVID-19 case fatality rates (Miller et al, 2020; Sala \u0026 Miyagawa, 2020; https://www.jsatonotes.com/2020/03/if-i-were-north-americaneuropeanaustral.html). The most recent data from publicly available resources also indicate that both COVID-19 incidence and total deaths are strongly associated with the presence or absence of national mandatory BCG vaccination programs. As seen in Table 1, seven of eight countries with very low numbers of total deaths (\u003C40 per one million population) adopted a mandatory BCG vaccination program using one of a set of 6 separate BCG strains (Table 1). In contrast, COVID-19 mortality was markedly higher in countries where BCG vaccination is not widely administered or is given only to high-risk groups. COVID-19 mortality was also higher in countries where widespread BCG vaccination was discontinued more than 20 years ago and in countries that used the BCG Denmark strain regularly or temporarily. This raises the question of whether BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 mortality are causally related. An additional question is why different BCG strains may be variably associated with mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miyasaka, Masayuki","journal":"EMBO molecular medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202012661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","Sala \u0026 Miyagawa","BCG Denmark"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["widespread BCG vaccination","countries","reduced COVID","separate BCG strains","different BCG strains","mortality","BCG Denmark strain","absence of national mandatory BCG vaccination programs","detected cases of COVID","Table","low numbers of total deaths","additional question","ongoing severe acute respiratory sickness coronavirus","case fatality rates","SARS-CoV","Miller et","presence","set","available resources","illness","Sala","recent data","incidence","population","pandemic","contrast","years","high-risk groups","Miyagawa"],"language":"en"},

Various parameters may influence intracranial aneurysm thrombosis, including the flow reduction induced by flow-diverter stent implantation, which is assumed to play a leading role. However, its actual impact remains unclear due to the lack of detailed intra-aneurysmal flow measurements. This study aimed to clarify this relationship by quantitatively measuring the intra-aneurysmal flow using 4D phase-contrast MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We acquired prospective pre- and post-stent implantation 4D phase-contrast MR imaging data of a consecutive series of 23 patients treated with flow-diverter stents. Velocity field data were combined with the intraprocedural 3D angiogram vessel geometries for precise intracranial aneurysm extraction and partial volume correction. Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic modifications were compared with occlusion outcomes at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS The averaged velocities at systole were lower after flow-diverter stent implantation for all patients and ranged from 21.7 \u00B1 7.1 cm/s before to 7.2 \u00B1 2.9 cm/s after stent placement. The velocity reduction was more important for the group of patients with aneurysm thrombosis at 6 months (68.8%) and decreased gradually from 66.2% to 55% for 12-month thrombosis and no thrombosis, respectively (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS We propose an innovative approach to measure intracranial flow changes after flow-diverter stent implantation. We identified a trend between flow reduction and thrombosis outcome that brings a new insight into current understanding of the flow-diversion treatment response.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brina, O; Bouillot, P; Reymond, P; Luthman, A S; Santarosa, C; Fahrat, M; Lovblad, K O; Machi, P; Delattre, B M A; Pereira, V M; Vargas, M I","journal":"AJNR.

Among US Veterans with HK, this retrospective, observational cohort study evaluated patiromer utilization, RAASi continuation, and K\u002B concentration change following patiromer initiation.Methods: Using data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, Veterans with HK (K\u002B \u22655.1 mmol/L) were included upon patiromer initiation (index date) during the study period (1/2016-8/2018). All patients had heart failure (HF), diabetes, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with end-stage renal disease were excluded. The following outcomes were assessed within 6-months post-patiromer initiation: patiromer utilization (using proportion of days covered); K\u002B concentration change (pre- vs post-initiation); and RAASi continuation.Results: 288 Veterans with HK were included. Baseline characteristics were: median age 70 years, African-American race 24%, diabetes 83%, HF 32%, CKD 95%, and median K\u002B concentration 5.7 mmol/L. At 1, 3, and 6 months post-index, the median patiromer PDC was 100%, 66%, and 44%, respectively. K\u002B concentration reductions post-patiromer initiation were, on average, - 1.0 mmol/L (P \u003C 0.001).

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted \u0022stay in place\u0022 or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection. This review speculates the importance of nutrition as a mitigation strategy to support immune function amid the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying food groups and key nutrients of importance that may affect the outcomes of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zabetakis, Ioannis; Lordan, Ronan; Norton, Catherine; Tsoupras, Alexandros","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe infections","cytokine storm of severe COVID","cardiovascular diseases","patient outcomes","outcomes of respiratory infections","patient immunocompromised","chronic lung diseases","pre-existing noncommunicable diseases","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pandemic","NCDs","countries","review","various handwashing","presence of poor nutritional status","importance of nutrition","role of diet","social distancing strategies","key nutrients of importance","significant risk factors","novel coronavirus disease","significant loss of life","hygiene guidelines","governments","advisories","diabetes mellitus","CVD","food groups","mitigation strategy","obesity","Global public health bodies","immune function","considerable economic distress","investigation","SARS-CoV","lockdown protocols","societies","place","common feature","complications","systemic inflammation","anti-inflammatory therapies","result","extreme cases","lifestyle","spread","world"],"language":"en"},

Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. OBJECTIVE Here, we report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19. DESIGN Brief report. SETTING A university hospital in Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANT A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever. INTERVENTION He was initially admitted with delirium and was subjected to a further work-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, he was subjected to a swab test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The patient\u0027s positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.

Intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma (ITPA) is also rare. Co-ocurrence of PTC and ITPA in the same thyroid lobe is extremely rare. Likewise, primary hyperparathyroidism with such non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is rare. The specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC (HPTC) is different from the classic, poorly differentiated and anaplastic variants and may contribute to its aggressive behavior. HPTC\u0027s genetic profile remains unclear. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 61-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with generalized aches, bone pain, polyuria, and right neck swelling of a few months\u0027 duration. Laboratory findings revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of the neck showed 4.6 cm complex nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Sestamibi scan suggested parathyroid adenoma in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance. She underwent right lobectomy, which normalized the intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels. Final pathology with immunohistochemical stains demonstrated HPTC and IPTA (2 cm each). Next-generation sequencing investigated the mutation spectrum of HPTC and detected BRAFV600E mutation. CONCLUSIONS A parathyroid adenoma should not exclude the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid evaluation is needed for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers. Cytomorphologic features to distinguish thyroid from parathyroid cells on FNA cytology must be considered. Immunohistochemical stains are important. BRAFV600E is the most common mutation in HPTC. This is possibly the first reported case of HPTC and ITPA co-occurring within the same thyroid lobe. Studies that define other molecular abnormalities may be useful as therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Yahri, Omer; Abdelaal, Abdelrahman; El Ansari, Walid; Farghaly, Hanan; Murshed, Khaled; Zirie, Mahmoud A; Al Hassan, Mohamed S","journal":"International journal of surgery case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITPA","PTC","HPTC","IPTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["right thyroid lobe","Thyroid evaluation","diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma","non-medullary thyroid carcinoma","missing concurrent thyroid cancers","mutation spectrum of HPTC","hobnail variant of papillary thyroid cancer","parathyroid cells","right neck","Intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma","reported case of HPTC","primary hyperparathyroidism","right lobectomy","ITPA co-occurring","specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC","detected BRAFV600E mutation","common mutation","immunohistochemical stains","intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels","Co-ocurrence of PTC","molecular abnormalities","FNA cytology","PRESENTATION OF CASE","HPTC\u0027s genetic profile","bone pain","endocrine clinic","generalized aches","polyuria","atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance","classic","patients","complex nodule","year-old woman","Fine-needle aspiration","INTRODUCTION","Final pathology","anaplastic variants","therapeutic targets","generation sequencing","Sestamibi scan","Cytomorphologic features","Laboratory findings","hypercalcemia","months\u0027 duration","IPTA","Studies","CONCLUSIONS","aggressive behavior","Ultrasound"],"language":"en"},

Unilateral damage to the macaque frontoparietal cortex commonly leads to deficits in contralesional target selection that resemble visual extinction. Recently, we showed that macaque monkeys with unilateral lesions in the caudal prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited contralesional target selection deficits that recovered over 2-4 months (Adam et al., 2019). Here, we investigated the longitudinal changes in functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal network after a small or large right caudal PFC lesion in four macaque monkeys. We collected ultra-high field resting-state fMRI at 7-T before the lesion and at weeks 1-16 post-lesion and compared the functional data with behavioural performance on a free-choice saccade task. We found that the pattern of frontoparietal network FC changes depended on lesion size, such that the recovery of contralesional extinction was associated with an initial increase in network FC that returned to baseline in the two small lesion monkeys, whereas FC continued to increase throughout recovery in the two monkeys with a larger lesion. We also found that the FC between contralesional dorsolateral PFC and ipsilesional parietal cortex correlated with behavioural recovery and that the contralesional dorsolateral PFC showed increasing degree centrality with the frontoparietal network. These findings suggest that both the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres play an important role in the recovery of function. Importantly, optimal compensation after large PFC lesions may require greater recruitment of distant and intact areas of the frontoparietal network, whereas recovery from smaller lesions was supported by a normalization of the functional network.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adam, Ramina; Johnston, Kevin; Menon, Ravi S; Everling, Stefan","journal":"NeuroImage","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31707193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FC","PFC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recovery of contralesional extinction","contralesional dorsolateral PFC","functional network","contralesional hemifield","small lesion monkeys","pattern of frontoparietal network FC changes","macaque frontoparietal cortex","behavioural recovery","lesion size","post-lesion","macaque monkeys","larger lesion","large PFC lesions","contralesional target selection deficits","large right caudal PFC lesion","recovery of function","Visual extinction","unilateral lesions","ipsilesional stimulus","visual stimulus","ipsilesional parietal cortex","caudal prefrontal cortex","smaller lesions","ipsilesional hemispheres","functional data","functional connectivity","behavioural performance","longitudinal changes","Unilateral damage","initial increase","increasing degree centrality","greater recruitment of distant","intact areas","important role","state fMRI","baseline","free-choice saccade task","ultra-high field","weeks","optimal compensation","normalization","Corbetta","Shulman","failure","months","Adam","findings"],"language":"en"},

Currently available systems cannot reliably assess the pH environment across wounds, which is the objective of this study. Approach: A disposable device, DETEC\u00AE pH, was developed and characterized on its ability to map wound alkalinity by pressing a freshly recovered wound dressing against its test surface. By comparing the wound\u0027s alkalinity and size reduction rates (\u223C7 days) following pH measurement, we assessed the capability of wound alkalinity to prognosticate subsequent short-term wound size reduction rates. Results: The device had high accuracy and specificity in determining the alkalinity of simulated wound fluids soaked onto wound dressing. The type of wound dressing type had an insignificant effect on its detection sensitivity. Upon testing discarded wound dressings from human patients, the device quickly determined alkaline and acidic wounds. Finally, statistical analyses of wound size reduction rates in wounds with various alkalinities confirmed that wound alkalinity has a strong influence on, at least, short-term wound healing activity. Innovation: Without directly contacting the patient, this device provides a quick assessment of wound alkalinity to prognosticate immediate and short-term wound healing activities. Conclusion: DETEC\u00AE pH may serve as a prognosis device for wound care specialists during routine wound assessment to predict wound healing progress. This information can assist the decision-making process in a clinical setting and augur well for chronic wound treatment. DETEC\u00AE pH can also be used as an aid for home health care nurses or health care providers to screen nonhealing wounds outside clinics.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vu, Hong; Nair, Ashwin; Tran, Lan; Pal, Suvra; Senkowsky, Jon; Hu, Wenjing; Tang, Liping","journal":"Advances in wound care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/wound.2019.1064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wound dressings","capability of wound alkalinity","wound healing progress","wound care specialists","routine wound assessment","quick assessment of wound alkalinity","chronic wound treatment","short-term wound healing activities","alkalinity of simulated wound fluids","survey of wound pH environment","short-term wound healing activity","type of wound dressing type","subsequent short-term wound size reduction rates","statistical analyses of wound size reduction rates","wound\u0027s alkalinity","pH measurement","prognosis device","disposable device","acidic wounds","prognostic indicator of nonhealing wounds","health care providers","Objective","home health care nurses","various alkalinities","augur","insignificant effect","clinical setting","human patients","specificity","days","decision-making process","high accuracy","strong influence","aid","testing","detection sensitivity","Results","clinics","Approach","test surface","myriads of studies","available systems","information","Conclusion","Innovation","study"],"language":"en"},

In-stent restenosis is an inflammatory response of the immune system to endovascular stent implantation in atherosclerotic patients. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are of great interest in this field in order to limit the side effects of stent treatments. Poly([R,S]-3,3-dimethylmalic acid) (PDMMLA) is a new biodegradable statistical polyester which presents promising properties as a stent coating. In this work, we studied by dynamic tensiometry, the adhesion of extracellular matrix proteins (bovine serum albumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin) and plasma membrane proteoglycan (syndecan-4) on three PDMMLA derivatives with different hydrophilicity levels. The results show that proteins have different adhesion profiles and affinity on these surfaces. They show similar behavior on the most hydrophilic surface, making hydrophilic, ionic and hydrogen type bonds. Then we compared each protein\u0027s individual profile to that of a mixture of all studied proteins. The comparison shows that vitronectin and syndecan-4 are the quantitatively dominating proteins adsorbed by specific interactions. Based on the results from previous studies, this work allowed us to identify the most important PDMMLA surface as a promising biomaterial for bioactive stent-coating.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gholizadeh, Elnaz; Belibel, Rima; Mora, Laurence; Letourneur, Didier; Barbaud, Christel","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods.

Both eyes and tears as portals of entry and sources of contagion have been the subject of debate by many authors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence currently available on COVID-19 and its ocular implications and manifestations, in both animals and humans, with the aim to facilitate prevention and educate the ophthalmological community on this subject. A review of the literature revealed that the results of some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to isolate the virus from the conjunctival sac of these patients. Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission. Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place. Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed. However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amesty, Mar\u00EDa A; Ali\u00F3 Del Barrio, Jorge L; Ali\u00F3, Jorge L","journal":"Ophthalmology and therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-020-00260-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","ocular manifestations","ocular implications","patients","ocular symptoms","infected eyes","ophthalmological implications","syndrome","review","correct prevention strategies","acute respiratory coronavirus disease","subject of debate","route of transmission","ophthalmological community","coronavirus strain SARS-CoV","sources of contagion","portals of entry","suffering","tears","animals","pneumonia","worldwide outbreak","focal point of discussion","management of ophthalmology clinics","common manifestation","humans","results","aim","ophthalmologists","place","studies","conjunctival sac","evidence","Conjunctivitis","literature","authors","humanity","guidelines","infection","well-designed trials","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to find the association between liver injuries and the severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS Online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science direct, were searched to detect relevant publications up to April 16, 2020. Depending on the heterogeneity between studies, a fixed- or random-effects model was applied to pool data. Publication bias Egger\u0027s test was also performed. RESULTS Meta-analysis of 20 retrospective studies (3428 patients), identified that patients with a severe manifestation of COVID-19 exhibited significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin values with prolonged prothrombin time. Furthermore, lower albumin level was associated with a severe presentation of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Liver dysfunction was associated with a severe outcome of COVID-19 disease. Close monitoring of the occurrence of liver dysfunction is beneficial in early warning of unfavorable outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, we took advantage of the live-attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine strain, YF-17D, as a model system for studying human antiviral immune responses in vivo following exposure to an acute primary virus challenge under safe and highly controlled conditions, to comprehensively analyse the dynamics of circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells. Methods We tracked and analysed the response of cTfh and other T and B cell subsets in peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by flow cytometry over the course of 4 weeks after YF-17D vaccination. Results Using surface staining of cell activation markers to track YFV-specific T cells, we found increasing cTfh cell frequencies starting at day 3 and peaking around 2 weeks after YF-17D vaccination. This kinetic was confirmed in a subgroup of donors using MHC multimer staining for four known MHC class II epitopes of YF-17D. The subset composition of cTfh cells changed dynamically during the course of the immune response and was dominated by the cTfh1-polarised subpopulation. Importantly, frequencies of cTfh1 cells correlated with the strength of the neutralising antibody response, whereas frequencies of cTfh17 cells were inversely correlated. Conclusion In summary, we describe detailed cTfh kinetics during YF-17D vaccination. Our results suggest that cTfh expansion and polarisation can serve as a prognostic marker for vaccine success. These insights may be leveraged in the future to improve current vaccine design and strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huber, Johanna E; Ahlfeld, Julia; Scheck, Magdalena K; Zaucha, Magdalena; Witter, Klaus; Lehmann, Lisa; Karimzadeh, Hadi; Pritsch, Michael; Hoelscher, Michael; von Sonnenburg, Frank; Dick, Andrea; Barba-Spaeth, Giovanna; Krug, Anne B; Rothenfu\u00DFer, Simon; Baumjohann, Dirk","journal":"Clinical \u0026 translational immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cells","response of cTfh","subset composition of cTfh cells","frequencies of cTfh1 cells","frequencies of cTfh17 cells","YFV-specific T cells","increasing cTfh cell frequencies","cTfh expansion","D vaccination","epitopes of YF","detailed cTfh kinetics","principal T helper cell subset","B cell subsets","Objectives T follicular helper","vaccine strain","neutralising antibody response","course","weeks","vaccine success","Results","surface staining of cell activation markers","MHC multimer staining","potent antibody responses","current vaccine design","human antiviral immune responses","known MHC class","yellow fever virus","dynamics of circulating Tfh","cTfh1-polarised subpopulation","acute primary virus challenge","exposure","peripheral blood of healthy volunteers","flow cytometry","model system","polarisation","strength","day","subgroup of donors","various pathogens","controlled conditions","future","prognostic marker","summary","advantage","strategies","Conclusion","study","insights","Methods"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to identify predictors of failed reperfusion. METHODS In this study 2211 patients from the German Stroke Registry who received EVT for anterior circulation stroke were retrospectively analyzed. Failure of reperfusion was defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 0/1/2a, and sufficient reperfusion as TICI 2b/3. In 1629 patients with complete datasets, associations between failure of reperfusion and baseline clinical data, comorbidities, location of occlusion, and procedural data were assessed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Failure of reperfusion occurred in 371 patients (16.8%) and was associated with the following locations of occlusion: cervical internal carotid artery (ICA, adjusted odds ratio, OR 2.01, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.08-3.69), intracranial ICA without carotid T occlusion (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.05-2.98), and M2 segment (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.21-2.84). Failed reperfusion was also associated with cervical ICA stenosis (\u003E70% stenosis, adjusted OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.69-4.97), stroke of other determined etiology by TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment) criteria (e.g. nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, adjusted OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.36-5.39), and treatment given outside the usual working hours (adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.86). Successful reperfusion was associated with higher Alberta stroke program early CT score (ASPECTS) on initial imaging (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92), treatment with the patient under general anesthesia (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96), and concomitant ICA stenting in patients with ICA stenosis (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.38). CONCLUSION Several factors are associated with failure of reperfusion, most notably occlusions of the proximal ICA and low ASPECTS on admission. Conversely, stent placement in the proximal ICA was associated with reperfusion success.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flottmann, Fabian; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias Djamsched; McDonough, Rosalie; Watermann, Lucas; Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Thomalla, G\u00F6tz; Herzberg, Moriz; Nolte, Christian H; Fiehler, Jens; Leischner, Hannes; Brekenfeld, Caspar","journal":"Clinical neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00880-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the German Stroke Registry","ICA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sufficient reperfusion","Successful reperfusion","reperfusion success","RESULTS Failure of reperfusion","proximal ICA","predictors of failed reperfusion","intracranial ICA","cervical ICA stenosis","adjusted odds ratio","acute stroke treatment","EVT","concomitant ICA stenting","German Stroke Registry","anterior circulation stroke","substantial minority of patients","location of occlusion","carotid T occlusion","TICI","study","following locations of occlusion","higher Alberta stroke program early CT score","cervical internal carotid artery","procedural data","acute large vessel occlusions","low ASPECTS","baseline clinical data","endovascular therapy","Trial of ORG","comorbidities","associations","flow restoration","TOAST","criteria","thrombolysis","determined etiology","cerebral infarction","complete datasets","majority of cases","AIM","initial imaging","nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies","admission","multiple logistic regression","confidence interval","general anesthesia","usual working hours","grades","stent placement","factors","CONCLUSION","METHODS","M2 segment"],"language":"en"},

A dysbiosis may then be observed in the course of development and mark a dysfunction within what is called the gut-brain axis. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate potential evidence of dysbiosis in children and young adults with NDD compared to controls. Using the PRISMA guidelines we systematically reviewed studies that compared the gut microbiota in NDD participants (with an age inferior to thirty) to the gut microbiota of controls, regardless of the data analysis methods used. The MEDLINE, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched up to September 2018. 31 studies with a total sample size of 3002 ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and 84 ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) participants were included in this systematic review. Independent data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. The quality of the studies was rated from low to high. Population characterization and experimental methods were highly heterogeneous in terms of the data available, selection of criteria, and dysbiosis measurement. A dysbiosis was reported in 28 studies in terms of either diversity, bacterial composition or metabolome dysfunction. Due to heterogeneity, a quantitative synthesis was not applicable. In this paper, we discuss the different biases to understand the complexity of microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders to provide leads for future cohort studies looking to answer the questions raised by the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit key body niches.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jurek, Lucie; Sevil, Marine; Jay, Agathe; Schr\u00F6der, Carmen; Baghdadli, Amaria; H\u00E9ry-Arnaud, Genevi\u00E8ve; Geoffray, Marie-Maude","journal":"European child \u0026 adolescent psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01544-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut microbiota of controls","reviewed studies","unbalanced gut microbiota","NDD participants","complexity of microbiota","dysbiosis measurement","future cohort studies","terms","data available","neurodevelopmental disorders","data analysis methods","potential evidence of dysbiosis","gut-brain axis","systematic review","Independent data extraction","experimental methods","metabolome dysfunction","quality assessment","Autism Spectrum Disorder","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","ADHD","ASD","children","diversity","leads","selection of criteria","young adults","bacterial composition","total sample size","trillions of microorganisms","questions","key body niches","different biases","Population characterization","scientific papers","age inferior","quantitative synthesis","MEDLINE","Scopus","PsycINFO databases","PRISMA guidelines","heterogeneity","course of development","aim"],"language":"en"},

To ensure the credibility of the data arising from these instruments, the methodological quality of development must be high. This paper reports the protocol for a systematic review of self-report instruments used to measure women\u0027s experiences of their maternity care. METHODS Citation databases CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE will be searched from 2002 to 2018 using keywords including women, experience, maternity care, questionnaires, surveys, and self-report. Citations will be screened by two reviewers, in two rounds, for inclusion as per predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction forms will be populated with data, extracted from each study, to evaluate the methodological quality of each survey instrument and the criteria for good measurement properties using quality criteria. Data will also be extracted to categorise the items included in each survey instrument. A combination of a structured narrative synthesis and quantitate summaries in tabular format will allow for recommendations to be made on the use, adaptation and development of future survey instruments. DISCUSSION The value of survey instruments that evaluate women\u0027s experiences of their maternity care, as a marker of quality care, has been recognised internationally with many countries employing the use of such instruments to inform policy and practice. The development of these instruments must be methodologically sound and the instrument itself fit for the purpose and context in which it is used. This protocol describes the methods that will be used to complete a systematic review that will serve as a guide for choosing the most appropriate existing instruments to use or adapt so that they are fit for purpose, in addition to informing the development of new instruments.

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used in order to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin. ACEI/ARB use showed no significant impact on patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Dong; Cheng, Biao; Chen, Jian; Peng, Anlin; Yang, Chen; Liu, Chong; Xiong, Mingrui; Deng, Aiping; Zhang, Yu; Zheng, Ling; Huang, Kun","journal":"Diabetes care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409498/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OBJECTIVE Diabetes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OBJECTIVE Diabetes","Older patients","proportion of comorbid diabetes","higher mortality of patients","distinct comorbidities of COVID","ARB use","aOR","ACEI","risk factors","clinical characteristics","Clinical outcomes","hypertension","greater risk","type","poor prognosis","elevated C-reactive protein","CONCLUSIONS C-reactive protein","older age","laboratory characteristics","different medications","Insulin usage","angiotensin","significant impact","retrospective study","symptoms","receptor blocker","adjusted odds ratio","typical features","lung imaging","METHODS","order","groups","death","RESEARCH DESIGN","blood pressure","ACE inhibitor","glucose","association","cases","year increase","Logistic regression","hospitalization","Attention"],"language":"en"},

Here, a vaccine non-specialist suggests how this might be done. I propose two alternative options and compare the primary alternative option with current practice. The basis of comparison is feasibility in achieving what we need: a safe, mass-produced, emerging virus-targeted vaccine on 2-4 week notice. The primary option is the following. (1) Start with a platform based on live viruses that infect bacteria, but not humans (bacteriophages, or phages). (2) Isolate phages (to be called pathogen homologs) that resemble and provide antigenic context for membrane-covered, pathogenic RNA viruses; coronavirus-phage homologs will probably be found if the search is correctly done. (3) Upon isolating a viral pathogen, evolve its phage homolog to bind antibodies neutralizing for the viral pathogen. Vaccinate with the evolved phage homolog by generating a local, non-hazardous infection with the phage host and then curing the infection by propagating the phage in the artificially infecting bacterial host. I discuss how this alternative option has the potential to provide what is needed after appropriate platforms are built.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Serwer, Philip","journal":"Antibiotics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics9050255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phage host","coronavirus-phage homologs","evolved phage homolog","primary alternative option","primary option","pathogen homologs","viral pathogen","emerging RNA viruses","vaccine responses","pathogenic RNA viruses","live viruses","alternative options","emerging virus-targeted vaccine","vaccine non-specialist","non-hazardous infection","bacterial host","Isolate phages","real-world look","membrane","reasons","current practice","antibodies","research community","antigenic context","humans","bacteriophages","week notice","basis of comparison","feasibility","following","potential","appropriate platforms"],"language":"en"},

Group A (control group), Group B (non-absorbable suture, Prolene suture), Group C (biological glue), Group D (non-absorbable suture, polyester suture) and Group E (absorbable suture). All rats were followed up for 8 weeks postoperatively and underwent laparotomy to observe the degree of adhesion and closure of the mesenteric defect. RESULTS No significant difference was found in the decrease in food intake and body weight among all groups. No internal hernia (IH) occurred in any group. The mesenteric defects of Group A remained completely visible without any closure or adhesion. Multiple gaps were found between the Prolene suture and the mesentery along the suture line in Group B.

Theoretical and conceptual arguments have suggested that elevated levels of acquired capability (AC) could be an explanatory factor accounting for this increased risk. However, empirical research utilizing the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS) in military populations has yielded mixed findings. METHODS To better ascertain what factors are associated with AC, and whether methodological limitations may be contributing to mixed findings, a systematic review was conducted. RESULTS A total of 31 articles utilized the ACSS to examine factors associated with AC, including combat history, in United States (U.S.) military personnel and Veterans. Nearly all studies (96.8%) were rated high risk of bias. Use of the ACSS varied, with seven different iterations utilized. Nearly all studies examined correlations between the ACSS and sample characteristics, mental health and clinical factors, Interpersonal Theory of Suicide constructs, and/or suicide-specific variables. Results of higher-level analyses, dominated by cross-sectional designs, often contradicted correlational findings, with inconsistent findings across studies. LIMITATIONS Included studies were non-representative of all U.S. military and Veteran populations and may only generalize to these populations. CONCLUSIONS Due to the high risk of bias, inconsistent use of the ACSS, lack of sample heterogeneity, and variability in factors examined, interpretation of current ACSS empirical data is cautioned. Suggestions for future research, contextualized by these limitations, are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kramer, Emily B; Gaeddert, Laurel A; Jackson, Christine L; Harnke, Ben; Nazem, Sarra","journal":"Journal of affective disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale","AC","ACSS"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["studies","military populations","inconsistent findings","mixed findings","increased risk","high risk of bias","clinical factors","Suicide Scale","correlational findings","BACKGROUND Military personnel","interpretation of current ACSS empirical data","inconsistent use","Veterans","suicide-specific variables","Acquired Capability","empirical research","methodological limitations","Veteran populations","Interpersonal Theory of Suicide constructs","sample characteristics","future research","lack of sample heterogeneity","Results of higher-level analyses","mental health","cross-sectional designs","elevated levels","United States","variability","explanatory factor accounting","combat history","non-representative","conceptual arguments","correlations","systematic review","articles","Suggestions","different iterations","total","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We examined associations of common genetic variants and repeated MetS score from early childhood to adolescence in a pan-European, prospective IDEFICS/I.Family cohort study with baseline survey and follow-up examinations after two and six years. We tested associations in 3067 children using a linear mixed model and confirmed the results with meta-analysis of identified SNPs. With a stringent Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons we obtained significant associations(p \u003C 1.4 \u00D7 10-4) for 5 SNPs, which were in high LD (r2 \u003E 0.85) in the 16q12.2 non-coding intronic chromosomal region of FTO gene with strongest association observed for rs8050136 (effect size(\u03B2) = 0.31, pWald = 1.52 \u00D7 10-5). We also observed a strong association of rs708272 in CETP with increased HDL (p = 5.63 \u00D7 10-40) and decreased TRG (p = 9.60 \u00D7 10-5) levels. These findings along with meta-analysis advance etiologic understanding of childhood MetS, highlighting that genetic predisposition to MetS is largely driven by genes of obesity and lipid metabolism. Inclusion of the associated genetic variants in polygenic scores for MetS may prove to be fundamental for identifying children and subsequently adults of the high-risk group to allow earlier targeted interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagrani, Rajini; Foraita, Ronja; Gianfagna, Francesco; Iacoviello, Licia; Marild, Staffan; Michels, Nathalie; Moln\u00E1r, D\u00E9nes; Moreno, Luis; Russo, Paola; Veidebaum, Toomas; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Marron, Manuela","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64031-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTO","MetS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","etiologic understanding of childhood MetS","repeated MetS score","associations of common genetic variants","associated genetic variants","genetic predisposition","significant associations","meta-analysis of identified SNPs","early childhood","strongest association","young adults","strong association of rs708272","better understanding of genetics","non-coding intronic chromosomal region of FTO gene","cohort study","results","multiple comparisons","baseline survey","rs8050136","CETP","adolescence","follow-up examinations","pan-European","16q12","polygenic scores","linear mixed model","effect size","high-risk group","increased HDL","stringent Bonferroni adjustment","critical insights","prevalence of metabolic syndrome","genes of obesity","lipid metabolism","origin","r2","targeted interventions","high LD","findings","Inclusion","disease","years","decreased TRG","pWald","levels"],"language":"en"},

Myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) was positive. We diagnosed ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (ANCA-RV). Treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by prednisolone (PSL) at 30 mg/day. We gradually reduced the PSL dose to 7.5 mg/day over 6 months. At that time, the patient developed disturbances of consciousness which progressed subacutely. MRI revealed regions of patchy white matter with an increased signal on T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences. JC virus DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), leading to a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare infectious demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus infection, occurring in highly immunosuppressed individuals such as HIV-infected patients and patients using some biological agents, and having a very poor prognosis. In the present case, PML may have been associated with steroid use, although there are very few case reports of PML in patients taking only steroids. We report progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during steroid treatment of ANCA-RV. When patients show progressive disturbance of consciousness during treatment for ANCA-RV, we need to take PML into consideration for differential diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tawara, Takashi; Kai, Hirayasu; Kageyama, Mikiko; Akiyama, Tomoki; Matsunaga, Takahiro; Sakuma, Aki; Ishii, Ryota; Tsunoda, Ryouya; Kawamura, Tetusya; Fujita, Akiko; Kaneko, Shuzo; Morito, Naoki; Saito, Chie; Usui, Joichi; Yamagata, Kunihiro","journal":"CEN case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13730-020-00482-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSL","PML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ANCA-RV","steroid treatment of ANCA","MPO-ANCA","case reports of PML","diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","progressive glomerulonephritis","progressive disturbance of consciousness","HIV-infected patients","present case","day","JC virus infection","JC virus DNA","diffusion-weighted sequences","cerebrospinal fluid","disturbances of consciousness","differential diagnosis","steroid use","PSL dose","fluid attenuated inversion recovery","central nervous system","FLAIR","rare infectious demyelinating disease","T2","regions of patchy white matter","increased signal","Myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody","polymerase chain reaction","CSF","immunosuppressed individuals","intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy","MRI","PCR","year-old woman","biological agents","renal vasculitis","consideration","time","steroids","poor prognosis","hospital","months"],"language":"en"},

Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE\u0027s detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Irvine, Michael; Coombs, Daniel; Skarha, Julianne; Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah; Taxman, Faye; Green, Traci C","journal":"Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-020-00441-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICE facilities","ICE Enforcement","ICE detention facilities","ICE facility outbreaks","ICE detainees widespread release","coronavirus outbreaks","day period","optimistic scenario","ICE detainee population data","ICE\u0027s detention facilities","spread of COVID","asynchronous outbreaks","day time horizons","local ICU beds","scenarios of transmission","minimum","mile radius","rate of COVID","R0","individuals","facilities house thousands of undocumented immigrants","Customs Enforcement","sick detainees","rapid spread","novel coronavirus","range of facility sizes","impacts","environments discordant","regional hospital intensive care unit","approximation of total positive cases","intervention measures","public health recommendations","estimates","unsafe environment","Removal Operations","ERO","infection","medical resources","continued availability of life","capacity","interventions","website","Immigration","pressing need","Models","policymakers","community"],"language":"en"},

With the evolution of robotics, advanced techniques including retro rectus mesh reinforcement, and component separation are being popularized. However, these procedures require more dissection, and longer operative times. In this study we reviewed our experience with robotic ventral/incisional hernia repair (RVHR) with hernia defect closure (HDC) and IPOM. METHODS Retrospective chart review and follow-up of 31 consecutive cases of ventral/incisional hernia treated between August 2011 and December 2018. Demographics, operative times, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), hernia size, location, and type, mesh size and type, recurrence, conversion to open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) and complications including bleeding, seroma formation and infection were analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 63.9 years old, with median BMI of 31.24 kg/m2. Median hernia area was 17 cm2. Mean operating time was 142.61 min (SD 59.79). Mean LOS was 1.46 days (range 1-5), with 48% being outpatient, and overnight stay in 32% for pain control. Conversion was necessary in 12.9% cases. Complication rate was 3% for enterotomy. Recurrence was 14.81% after a mean follow-up of 26.96 months. There was significant association of recurrence with COPD history (P = 0.0215) and multiple hernia defects (P = 0.0376). CONCLUSION Our recurrence rate (14.81%) compares favorably to those reported in literature (16.7%) for LVHR with HDC and IPOM. Our experience also indicates that IPOM is associated with satisfactory outcomes, low conversion and complications rates, and short LOS.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuenmayor, Pedro; Lujan, Henry J; Plasencia, Gustavo; Karmaker, Avik; Mata, Wilmer; Vecin, Nicole","journal":"Journal of robotic surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-019-01040-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31897967/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Recurrence"],"organizations":["IPOM","BMI","HDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hernia size","incisional hernia repair","robotic ventral hernia repair","open ventral hernia repair","IPOM","Median hernia area","Mean LOS","hernia defect closure","multiple hernia defects","recurrence rate","mean follow-up","mesh size","consecutive cases of ventral","RVHR","type","low conversion","short LOS","significant association of recurrence","operative times","HDC","experience","intraperitoneal onlay mesh","retro rectus mesh reinforcement","complications rates","length of stay","overnight stay","median BMI","Complication rate","advanced techniques","blood loss","OVHR","location","satisfactory outcomes","common technique","years old","bleeding","COPD history","METHODS Retrospective chart review","component separation","evolution of robotics","seroma formation","Demographics","RESULTS","age","infection","dissection","LVHR","days","range","cm2","pain control","operating time","SD","BACKGROUND","enterotomy","outpatient","study","CONCLUSION","months","procedures","literature"],"language":"en"},

Endovascular treatment was proposed because of a slight angiographic change in the shape of the aneurysm in the past year. The aneurysm at the non-branching site of the right calloso-marginal artery was 2 mm distal to the origin, and measured 3 mm in height and 3.3 mm in width, with a neck measuring 1.7 mm wide; the calloso-marginal artery diameter was 1.6 mm. The aneurysm was successfully embolized with a simple technique using a Pre-Shaped S Microcatheter and two coils.

Those who died, compared to those who survived, differed on multiple biomarker levels on admission including elevated levels of cardiac troponin (\u002B44.2 ng/L, 95% CI 19.0-69.4; P=0.0006); C-reactive protein (\u002B66.3 \u00B5g/mL, 95% CI 46.7-85.9; P\u003C0.00001); interleukin-6 (\u002B4.6 ng/mL, 95% CI 3.6-5.6; P\u003C0.00001); D-dimer (\u002B4.6 \u00B5g/mL, 95% CI 2.8-6.4; P\u003C0.00001); creatinine (\u002B15.3 \u00B5mol/L, 95% CI 6.2-24.3; P=0.001) and alanine transaminase (\u002B5.7 U/L, 95% CI 2.6-8.8; P=0.0003); as well as decreased levels of albumin (-3.7 g/L, 95% CI -5.3 to -2.1; P\u003C0.00001). Individuals with underlying cardiometabolic disease and that present with evidence for acute inflammation and end-organ damage are at higher risk of mortality due to COVID-19 infection and should be managed with greater intensity.

This study aims to stratify face shield needs when performing head and neck cancer surgery. METHODS Fifteen patients underwent surgery between 01 March 2020 and 09 April 2020. Operative diagnosis and procedure; droplet count and distribution on face shields were documented. RESULTS Forty-five surgical procedures were performed for neck nodal metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin (n=3); carcinoma of tonsil (n=2), tongue (n=2), nasopharynx (n=3), maxilla (n=1) and laryngo-pharynx (n=4). Droplet contamination was 57.8%, 59.5%, 8.0% and 0% for operating, first and second assistant surgeons, and scrub nurse respectively. Droplet count was highest and most widespread during osteotomies.

METHODS A retrospective database review was undertaken involving, in Part I (Belgium), 290 consecutive SILS, including 80.68% primary bariatric surgeries, and 19.32% revisional gastric bypass, followed in Part II (Lebanon), by 40 selective primary SILS. Training for and standardization of the trans-umbilical technique was done for the operating room team, and was executed in part II. RESULTS The procedure of single incision was successfully completed in all of the 330 cases part I \u0026 part II. There was a need for additional salvage for one or two trocars in respectively 3.1% and 2.75% of the cases. There were no deaths or conversions in either group. Early complications included one medically healed fistula after revisional GB, and two secondary gastric and intestinal perforation requiring reoperations. Late surgical complications were: \u00223 patients (1.03%) in Part I and 2 (5%) in Part II suffered occlusions, requiring laparoscopic mesenteric defect\u0027s closure on an internal herniation.\u0022 Twelve patients (4.1%) from part I and 5 (12.5%) in part II suffered an incisional hernia. CONCLUSION Selective SILS, when standardized, tends to be superior to consecutive SILS in terms of overall morbidity, operative time, and need for additional salvage trocars. Cost effectiveness and higher midterm rate of umbilical port site incisional hernia should be weighed against the beneficial cosmetic effect for the patient.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chelala, Elie; El Hajj Moussa, Wissam; Rizk, Simon; Assaker, Nidal","journal":"Obesity surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-04356-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31858397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consecutive SILS","selective primary SILS","consecutive primary","revisional SILS bariatric surgeries","CONCLUSION Selective SILS","primary bariatric surgeries","revisional GB","standardization","revisional gastric bypass","additional salvage trocars","patients","need","cases","incisional hernia\u0027s prevalence","higher midterm rate of umbilical port site incisional hernia","Early complications","trans-umbilical technique","Late surgical complications","terms of overall morbidity","laparoscopic mesenteric defect\u0027s closure","operative time","technical improvements","healed fistula","internal herniation","Cost effectiveness","occlusions","intestinal perforation","reoperations","beneficial cosmetic effect","METHODS","retrospective database review","operating room team","feasibility","safety","procedure of single incision","deaths","conversions","group","paper","factors","Training","Lebanon","Belgium","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Thirteen consecutive patients with benign uterine disease underwent robotic NOTES hysterectomy at Eulji University Hospital between February 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS Due to the presence of pelvic adhesions, one of these patients underwent hybrid robotic NOTES hysterectomy with the assistance of isobaric single port laparoscopy; however, there was no conversion to another hysterectomy type such as conventional laparoscopy, laparotomy, or traditional multiport robotic surgery. Median uterine weight was 290 g (range 115-892 g). Median docking and console times were 15 min (range 5-25 min) and 135 min (range 92-215 min), respectively. Mean change in hemoglobin on the first postoperative day was 0.67 \u00B1 0.7 g/dL. Median EBL was 50 mL (20-450 mL). Median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (3-4 days). No patients experienced postoperative complications such as damage to adjacent organs, re-operation, or vaginal cuff hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that robotic NOTES hysterectomy is a feasible and safe scarless and gasless surgical technique.

CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 95% of cases. We aimed to share the first case of coexistence of simple virilizing-type congenital adrenal hyperplasia [I172N mutation in the CYP21A], triple translocation [t(9;11;12)], and ovarian granulose cell tumor. METHODS A 59-year-old female patient was presented to our clinic, complaining with abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass, virilism, ambiguous genitalia, clitoramegaly, and hyperpigmentation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a giant mass originating from the right tubo-ovarian structure. RESULTS The patient was operated in the light of the clinico-radiological features mentioned above. A giant mass weighing 3500 g was detected on the right tubo-ovarian structure during laparotomy, and mass was excised with right tubo-ovarian structure. Immunohistochemical examination revealed ovarian granulosa cell tumor. The high serum concentration of 17-OH progesterone was measured at baseline and after 250-\u03BCg bolus of synthetic ACTH. In genetic analysis, we screened for six-point mutations, large deletions, and non-common mutations using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, PCR, and sequencing of CYP21 gene respectively. The patient was detected to be homozygous for the I172N mutation. In addition, 50% of the metaphases examined had triple translocation [t(9;11;12)]. CONCLUSION The coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, triple chromosomal translocations, and ovarian granulosa cell tumor has not been described previously. This coexistence may be a sign of a new syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akbulut, Sami; Ceylan, Senay Durmaz; Tuncali, Timur; Sogutcu, Nilgun","journal":"Journal of gastrointestinal cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-020-00408-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["right tubo-ovarian structure","ovarian granulosa cell tumor","ovarian granulose cell tumor","coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia","giant mass","palpable abdominal mass","PURPOSE Congenital adrenal hyperplasia","triple translocation","simple virilizing-type congenital adrenal hyperplasia","CAH","METHODS","abdominal pain","I172N mutation","case of coexistence","triple chromosomal translocations","abdominal computed tomography","year-old female patient","Immunohistochemical examination","Physical examination","non-common mutations","restriction fragment length polymorphism","PCR","RFLP","virilism","CYP21A","ambiguous genitalia","large deletions","rare autosomal recessive disease","laparotomy","OH progesterone","baseline","light","metaphases","CONCLUSION","high serum concentration","\u03BCg bolus of synthetic ACTH","sequencing of CYP21 gene","hydroxylase deficiency accounts","clinico-radiological features","sign","Contrast","new syndrome","cases","hyperpigmentation","distension","genetic analysis","addition"],"language":"en"},

The virus was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and continues to be endemic in the region. Most of the initial MERS-CoV cases in 2012 and early 2013 were sporadic, and it remains unclear whether MERS-CoV was circulating before 2012 or not. Therefore, we tried here to find any molecular evidence of MERS-CoV circulation in humans before or during 2012 in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY We examined 349 archived respiratory samples collected between January 2010 and December 2012 from patients with acute respiratory illnesses from the city of Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia. All samples were screened for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upstream E-gene (UpE) and the open reading frame 1 a (ORF1a).

These mental health issues can potentially lead to nurses taking leaves of absence and may require accommodations for their return to work. The purpose of this review was to map key themes in the peer-reviewed literature about accommodations for nurses\u0027 return to work following leaves of absence for mental health issues. METHODS A six-step methodological framework for scoping reviews was used to summarize the amount, types, sources, and distribution of the literature. The academic literature was searched through nine electronic databases. Electronic charts were used to extract code and collate the data. Findings were derived inductively and summarized thematically and numerically. RESULTS Academic literature is scarce regarding interventions for nurses\u0027 return to work following leaves of absence for mental health issues, and most focused on substance use concerns. Search of the peer-reviewed literature yielded only six records. The records were primarily quantitative studies (n = 4, 68%), published between 1997 and 2018, and originated in the United States (n = 6, 100%). The qualitative thematic findings addressed three major themes: alternative to discipline programs (ADPs), peer support, and return to work policies, procedures, and practices. CONCLUSIONS While the literature supports alternative to discipline programs as a primary accommodation supporting return to work of nurses, more on the effectiveness of such programs is required. Empirical evidence is necessary to develop, maintain, and refine much needed return to work accommodations for nurses after leaves of absence for mental health issues.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Covell, Christine L; Sands, Shamel Rolle; Ingraham, Kenchera; Lavoie-Tremblay, Melanie; Price, Sheri L; Reichert, Carol; Bourgeault, Ivy L","journal":"Human resources for health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00478-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["work of nurses","mental health issues","work accommodations","leaves of absence","nurses\u0027 return","peer-reviewed literature","work policies","needed return","RESULTS Academic literature","risk of nurses","discipline programs","alternative","peer support","records","substance use disorders","substance use concerns","major themes","key themes","Electronic charts","electronic databases","qualitative thematic findings","burnout","depression","primary accommodation","interventions","step methodological framework","anxiety","ADPs","posttraumatic stress disorder","complexity of nursing practice","scoping reviews","PTSD","METHODS","BACKGROUND","code","quantitative studies","sources","distribution","procedures","practices","Search","Empirical evidence","types","United States","CONCLUSIONS","effectiveness","purpose"],"language":"en"},

There are two major devices used for stapled hemorrhoidopexy, PPH stapler (Ethicon EndoSurgery) and DST stapler (Covidien). This study was conducted to investigate the postoperative outcomes among patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids who underwent hemorrhoidopexy with either of these two devices. A total of 242 consecutive patients underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy with either PPH stapler (110 patients) or DST stapler (132 patients) at a single center in 2017. We performed a retrospective case-control study to compare the short-term postoperative outcomes and the complications between these two groups. After matching the cases in terms of age, gender, and the grade of hemorrhoids, there were 100 patients in each group (PPH versus DST). There were no significant differences in the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score and analgesic usage. Among complications, the incidence of anorectal stricture was significantly higher in the DST group (p = 0.02). Evaluation of the mucosal specimen showed that the total surface area, the muscle/mucosa ratio and the surface area of the muscle were also significantly higher in the DST group (p = 0.03). Further analysis of the DST group demonstrated that patients with anorectal stricture after surgery are younger than patients without anorectal stricture, and higher muscle/mucosa ratio (p = 0.03) and a higher surface area of the muscle (p = 0.03) also measured in the surgical specimen. The two devices provide similar outcomes of postoperative recovery. Patients who underwent DST stapled hemorrhoidopexy had a higher incidence rate of stricture, larger area of muscle excision, and higher muscle/mucosa ratio in the surgical specimen. Further investigation is warranted for a better understanding of the correlation between muscle excision and anorectal stricture.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Tzu-Hsuan; Kiu, Kee-Thai; Yen, Min-Hsuan; Chang, Tung-Cheng","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62141-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["DST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher muscle","DST stapler","DST group","DST stapled hemorrhoidopexy","consecutive patients","higher surface area","incidence of anorectal stricture","higher incidence rate of stricture","larger area of muscle excision","PPH stapler","mucosa ratio","postoperative pain","total surface area","short-term postoperative outcomes","similar outcomes of postoperative recovery","surgical specimen","postoperative visual analog scale","complications","mucosal specimen","grade of hemorrhoids","major devices","faster recovery","retrospective case-control study","VAS","Ethicon EndoSurgery","score","correlation","gender","significant differences","better understanding","advantages","analgesic usage","terms of age","conventional hemorrhoidectomy","cases","Covidien","investigation","Evaluation","single center","analysis","groups"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this systematic review was to answer the question: Is high-dose AR drug holiday, at the time of tooth extraction or dentoalveolar surgery, necessary to prevent the development of MRONJ in patients with cancer? This protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for relevant studies up to and including April 2019.

Although only one study fitted the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework, valuable information on AR drug holiday could be extracted from 14 of 371 reviewed articles. Among these, 3 were prospective and 11 were retrospective studies. These studies described or evaluated high-dose AR drug holidays. In 2 studies, patients were being treated with denosumab, but neither showed that a drug holiday was effective. The remaining 12 studies evaluated bisphosphonate treatment and 2 of these studies found no reason to use AR drug holiday before surgery. Three studies recommended drug holidays, whereas most of the studies recommended assessing each patient separately. The only paper that fitted the PICO approach was a non-randomized, prospective study with a control group. This study concluded that drug holiday was not necessary. Thus, there are no evidence for using drug holiday, but it is also clear that caused by a limited numbers of eligible patients, and a great variation in between these patient, high-level evidence for using AR drug holiday is almost impossible to obtain.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ottesen, Camilla; Schiodt, Morten; Gotfredsen, Klaus","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICO"],"locations":["PROSPERO"],"keyphrases":["cross-sectional studies","retrospective studies","relevant studies","high-dose AR drug holidays","prospective study","high-dose antiresorptive","Randomized controlled trials","limited numbers of eligible patients","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","Systematic Reviews","PICO approach","high-level evidence","dentoalveolar surgery","manual searches","Electronic searches","development of MRONJ","framework","valuable information","outcome","cohort","time of tooth extraction","RCTs","Meta Analysis","great variation","related osteonecrosis","Preferred Reporting Items","comparison","intervention","surveys","question","case reports","jaw","Embase","PRISMA","population","bisphosphonate treatment","reason","risk of medication","control group","temporary discontinuation","reference linkage","cancer","agents","protocol","PROSPERO database","Medline","aim","paper","reviewed articles","Records","denosumab"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied. Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well we treatment measures were collected and analyzed. RESULTS We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n=24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritine and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (p\u003C 0.01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19.

Re-usable elastomeric respirators may provide a suitable alternative. Proprietary elastomeric respirator filters may become depleted as demand increases. An alternative may be the virus/bacterial filters used in anaesthesia circuits, if they can be adequately fitted onto the elastomeric respirators. In addition, many re-usable elastomeric respirators do not filter exhaled breaths. If used for sterile procedures, this would also require modification. We designed a 3D-printed adaptor that permits elastomeric respirators to interface with anaesthesia circuit filters and created a simple modification to divert exhaled breaths through the filter. We conducted a feasibility study evaluating the performance of our modified elastomeric respirators. A convenience sample of eight volunteers was recruited. Quantitative fit testing, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded during fit testing exercises and after one hour of wear. All eight volunteers obtained excellent quantitative fit testing throughout the trial. The mean (SD) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (0.5) kPa and 4.6 (0.4) kPa at baseline and after one hour of wear (p = 0.148). The mean (SD) respiratory rate was 16 (4) breaths.min-1 and 17 (3) breaths.min-1 at baseline and after one hour of wear (p = 0.435). Four of eight subjects self-reported discomfort; two reported facial pressure, one reported exhalation resistance and one reported transient dizziness on exertion.

BACKGROUND Breastfeeding benefits mothers, infants and society yet breastfeeding rates continue to fall below recommendations in part due to inadequate tailored support after hospital discharge. Influences on breastfeeding are complex and include many physiological, psychosocial and cultural factors. AIM To better understand the experience of women who have feelings of aversion during breastfeeding by synthesising the existing literature. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched for relevant literature published between 2000 to 2019. Using Covidence software, five qualitative research studies were identified. Studies were then analysed using meta-ethnographic qualitative synthesis. FINDINGS Feelings of aversion during breastfeeding were described as visceral and overwhelming; leading to feelings of shame and inadequacy. This synthesis identified five findings; a central conceptual category of \u0022it\u0027s such a strong feeling of get away from me\u0022 with four key metaphors translated from this central conceptual category: \u0022I do it because I feel it is best for my baby\u0022, \u0022I can\u0027t control those feelings\u0022, \u0022I should be able to breastfeed my son and enjoy it\u0022, and \u0022I\u0027m glad I did it\u0022. This phenomenon may negatively affect a women\u0027s sense of self and impact on the mother-infant relationship. CONCLUSION Some women who want to breastfeed can experience feelings of aversion while breastfeeding. The feelings of \u0027aversion\u0027 while breastfeeding can inhibit women from achieving their personal breastfeeding goals.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morns, Melissa A; Steel, Amie E; Burns, Elaine; McIntyre, Erica","journal":"Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32089458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breastfeeding rates","FINDINGS Feelings of aversion","unexpected feelings of aversion","feelings of shame","personal breastfeeding goals","experience of women","BACKGROUND Breastfeeding benefits mothers","infant suckling","central conceptual category","relevant literature","existing literature","Infant Care databases","mother-infant relationship","qualitative research studies","PROBLEM Limited literature","meta-ethnographic qualitative synthesis","PsycINFO","infants","impact","Maternity","society","CINAHL","reaction","inadequate tailored support","women\u0027s sense of self","hospital discharge","Covidence software","recommendations","METHODS MEDLINE","key metaphors","cultural factors","phenomenon","inadequacy","Influences","strong feeling","CONCLUSION","baby"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS The first patient was a 50-year-old man who presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation and positive testing for GD1b-IgG antibodies. Five days before, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and a fever. The second patient was a 39-year-old man who presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days before, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and a poor general condition. The oropharyngeal swab test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay was positive in both patients and negative in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Methods and Results Retrospective analysis of the AKI incidence in 1089 consecutive patients receiving CT angiography and mechanical thrombectomy from 2015 to 2017 and in subgroups with CKD (n=99) and CT perfusion (n=104) was performed. Patients received a standardized hydration protocol. Data on kidney function after mechanical thrombectomy were available in 1017 patients. A total of 59 (5.8%) patients developed AKI, and only 4 (6.8%) patients needed hemodialysis, all with known CKD. Patients with AKI significantly more often had known CKD (20.3% versus 8.4%, P=0.002), diabetes mellitus (33.9% versus 20.9%, P=0.018), and tandem occlusion (32.2% versus 16.2%, P=0.003) and a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (20.3% versus 7.0%, P\u003C0.001) compared with patients without AKI.

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN Retrospective case-control. SETTING Fever ward of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS Patients \u226560 years of age with COVID-19 (n = 244) were included, of which 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (i.e., p \u003C .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] 0.009 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001-0.138]; p = .001) and older age (OR 1.1 22 [95% CI 1.007-1.249]; p = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (p = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS Review of the current state of knowledge regarding the viral etiology of COVID-19, mechanisms of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effect of individual DMTs on the risk of infection and COVID-19 disease expression. RESULTS Although data are limited, MS DMTs do not obviously increase the risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The severe morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be largely the consequence of an overly robust immune response rather than the consequence of unchecked viral replication. The effects of specific MS DMTs on the immune response that may increase the risk of impaired viral clearance and their potential counterbalancing beneficial effects on the development of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are reviewed. CONCLUSION Although there is currently insufficient real-world experience to definitively answer the question of the effect of a specific MS DMT on COVID-19, registries presently in nascent form should provide these answers.

PED causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, which has led to substantial economic losses in many countries and is a great threat to the global swine industry. Interferons (IFNs) are major cytokines involved in host innate immune defense, which induce the expression of a broad range of antiviral effectors that help host to control and antagonize viral infections. PEDV infection does not elicit a robust IFN response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled. PEDV evades the host innate immune response by two main strategies including: (1) encoding IFN antagonists to disrupt innate immune pathway, and (2) hiding its viral RNA to avoid the exposure of viral RNA to immune sensors. This review highlights the immune evasion mechanisms employed by PEDV, which provides insights for the better understanding of PEDV-host interactions and developing effective vaccines and antivirals against CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shasha; Yang, Jinping; Zhu, Zixiang; Zheng, Haixue","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9050367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune response","innate immune pathway","immune defense","immune sensors","PEDV infection","host interactions","immune evasion mechanisms","better understanding of PEDV","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","exposure of viral RNA","robust IFN response","viral infections","causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea","lethal watery diarrhea","IFN antagonists","global swine industry","swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","effective vaccines","major cytokines","countries","great threat","expression","piglets","antivirals","insights","broad range of antiviral effectors","substantial economic losses","main strategies","Interferons","IFNs","CoVs","review"],"language":"en"},

The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus RaTG132. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses3,4, whether SARS-CoV-2 has other hosts remains ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from a Malayan pangolin showed 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain within the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one noncritical amino acid difference. Results of comparative genomic analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. The Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 of 25 Malayan pangolins analyzed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against Pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins suggests that they have the potential to act as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

Minimally invasive surgery, multimodal analgesia, early mobilization, and early postoperative nutrition have been considered as critical components of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery (ERSS). The objective of this study will be to synthesize the evidence underpinning individual components of a proposed multidisciplinary enhanced recovery pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. METHODS This is the study protocol for a systematic review of complex interventions. Our team identified 22 individual care components of a proposed pathway based on clinical practice guidelines and published reviews. We will include systematic reviews and meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in adults or pediatric patients evaluating any one of the pre-determined care components. Our primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, morbidity outcomes (e.g., pulmonary, cardiac, renal, surgical complications), patient-reported outcomes and experiences (e.g., pain, quality of care experience), and health services outcomes (e.g., length of stay and costs). We will search the following databases (1990 onwards) MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The risk of bias for individual studies will be appraised using appropriate tools. A narrative synthesis will be provided with the information presented in the text and tables to summarize and explain the characteristics and findings of the included studies. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we do not anticipate to conduct meta-analyses. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each component of care will be classified according to the GRADE system. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence underpinning individual components of a pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. The formation of an evidence-based pathway will allow for the standardization of clinical care delivery within the context of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery.

Identifying, collecting, qualifying and preparing plasma from convalescent patients with adequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Ab titers in an acute crisis setting may be challenging, although well within the remit of most blood establishments. Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiberghien, Pierre; de Lambalerie, Xavier; Morel, Pascal; Gallian, Pierre; Lacombe, Karine; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan","journal":"Vox sanguinis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["convalescent patients","convalescent plasma","mortality","COVID","adequate SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV related pneumonia","viral spread","early phases","various viral respiratory diseases","neutralizing Ab titers","high risk of deleterious evolution","Prior findings","therapeutic relief","number CODID","acute crisis","frequency of patient deterioration","formal proof of efficacy","approach","cases","passive immunotherapy","remit","blood establishments","Careful clinical evaluation","subsequent immunopathology"],"language":"en"},

There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity. METHODS An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID-19 testing. Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities and COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). RESULTS One-hundred and forty-five participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p\u003C0.05). A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID-19 results. To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSION Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID-19 positive test result. Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID-19 test results. A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance. This article is protected by copyright.

This study was performed to explore the efficacy of pure taTME (p-taTME) without laparoscopic assistance as a completely non-invasive surgical procedure for rectal cancer. Methods We retrospectively evaluated all patients with rectal cancer who underwent p-taTME between December 2015 and April 2018. Relevant patient characteristics and clinical information including the surgical procedure, specimens, pathological characteristics, and patients\u0027 post-operative state were analysed and the feasibility of p-taTME in patients with rectal cancer was assessed. Results Fifty-five patients who had undergone p-taTME were included in this study. They comprised 32 (58.2%) men and 23 (41.8%) women with a mean age of 65.6 \u00B1 10.6 years and mean body mass index of 23.4 \u00B1 3.3 kg/m2. The median surgical time was 180.0 (range, 130-360) min and estimated blood loss was 25.0 (range, 15-80) mL. The commonest post-operative complication was varying degrees of faecal incontinence (56.4%). However, such incontinence greatly improved after pelvic-floor-function-rehabilitation exercises and did not seriously affect the patients\u0027 quality of life. Conclusions p-taTME is a relatively safe and incisionless procedure for patients with middle and low rectal cancer, especially in those with obesity or a narrow pelvis. However, further studies of the indications and long-term efficacy are needed to verify the suitability of this procedure.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Yan-Yan; Yu, Gang; Rong, Zhen; Geng, Rui-Chao; Wang, Rui; Chen, Long-Yi; Liu, Gang","journal":"Gastroenterology report","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gastro/goz055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32104585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusions p-taTME","h-taTME","low rectal cancer","incisionless surgical procedure","incisionless procedure","non-invasive surgical procedure","efficacy of pure taTME","feasibility of p","median surgical time","range","study","patients\u0027 post-operative state","pathological characteristics","commonest post-operative complication","laparoscopic assistance","long-term efficacy","mean age","Relevant patient characteristics","patients\u0027 quality of life","anatomic difficulties of laparoscopic surgery","varying degrees of faecal incontinence","mean body mass index","clinical information","hybrid transanal total mesorectal excision","years","specimens","pelvic-floor","function-rehabilitation exercises","estimated blood loss","studies","indications","Background","obesity","narrow pelvis","women","suitability","Results","Methods","m2"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the association between habitual sleep timing during work days and work-free days, working time and membership in Mensa, an organization of highly intelligent individuals (IQ \u2265130) using a sample of 1,172 adults split between Mensa members and age- and sex-matched volunteers from a large web-based database. We found no difference in chronotype, and the later sleep timing of Mensa members on work days was fully accounted for by later work start times. Our results indicate that later sleep timing in those with higher IQs is not due to physiological differences, but rather due to later work schedules.

The following topics are the relevant contents: need for consultation in the matter of anxiety for coronavirus and interpersonal mental and psychosomatic problems due to the necessary social distancing, care especially in precarious living situations, altered communication structures (telephone, video consultation) and care of those occupied with the topic of \u0022coronavirus disease 2019\u0022 (COVID-19). All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions. Furthermore, appropriate general hygiene regulations are explained. Finally, what the patients are told is illustrated using a simple schematic aid: distance (minimum 2 m), rubbing (wash hands with soap often and for at least 20 s), avoidance (pass by in a friendly manner), alternative communication, forsaking (shopping is not always necessary), wiping (regularly wipeing of all surfaces by the cleaning personnel as well as tablet and mobile telephone by the patients themselves) and outside activity as much as possible, alone or sitting together (with safety distance). The psychosomatic services were appropriately converted.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loew, Thomas H; Krinninger, Maximilian; Kettler, Christian","journal":"Psychotherapeut","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00278-020-00426-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","psychosomatic problems","psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care","psychosomatic clinics","psychosomatic services","fundamental patterns of care","coronavirus disease","current coronavirus","rededication","COVID","alternative communication","video consultation","mobile telephone","quarantine conditions","safety distance","altered communication structures","necessary social distancing","medical epidemic conditions","core aspects of hygiene","appropriate general hygiene regulations","admittance","precarious living situations","virologic diagnostic process","friendly manner","forsaking","tablet","pandemic","matter of anxiety","private practice","pass","cleaning personnel","simple schematic aid","relevant contents","continuation","article","picture","provisions","new challenges","shopping","soap","order","psychotherapists","surfaces","following topics","avoidance","wipeing","outside activity","institutions","stepwise evacuation","wash hands"],"language":"en"},

Although the optimal volume of IV fluid is unknown, there is evidence that excessive administration can be deleterious. Static measures of volume status have not proven to be meaningful resuscitative endpoints. Determination of volume responsiveness has putative benefits over static measures, but its effect on outcomes is unknown. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if resuscitation with a volume responsiveness-guided approach leads to improved outcomes in septic patients. Data Sources We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception until April 2018. Study Selection Prospective studies of patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock that compared volume responsiveness-guided fluid resuscitation to standard techniques and reported mortality data. Data Extraction We extracted study details, patient characteristics, volume responsiveness assessment method, and mortality data. Data Synthesis Of the 1,224 abstracts and 31 full-texts evaluated, four studies (total 365 patients) met inclusion criteria. Using random effects modeling, the pooled odds ratio for mortality at time of longest follow-up with a volume responsiveness-guided strategy was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.49-1.54). Pooling of clinical data was not possibly owing to heterogeneity of reporting in individual studies. Conclusions We found no significant difference in mortality between septic patients resuscitated with a volume responsiveness-guided approach compared with standard resuscitative strategies. It remains unclear whether the findings are due to the small sample size or a true lack of efficacy of a volume responsiveness-guided approach.","publish_time":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehrman, Robert R; Gallien, John Z; Smith, Reid K; Akers, Katherine G; Malik, Adrienne N; Harrison, Nicholas E; Welch, Robert D; Levy, Phillip D; Sherwin, Robert L","journal":"Critical care explorations","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Selection Prospective"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["volume responsiveness-guided approach","Determination of volume responsiveness","volume responsiveness-guided strategy","volume responsiveness-guided fluid resuscitation","optimal volume","volume responsiveness assessment method","reported mortality data","septic patients","Static measures of volume status","Data Extraction","Data Sources","Data Synthesis","Pooling of clinical data","Study Selection Prospective studies of patients","septic shock","severe sepsis","management of sepsis","individual studies","standard resuscitative strategies","standard techniques","study details","improved outcomes","meaningful resuscitative endpoints","patient characteristics","pooled odds ratio","true lack of efficacy","time of longest follow-up","Cochrane Library","Web of Science","EMBASE","putative benefits","small sample size","CINAHL","evidence","PubMed","significant difference","random effects modeling","Google Scholar","meta-analysis","critical component","systematic review","excessive administration","heterogeneity of reporting","findings","goal","inception","texts","fluids","inclusion criteria","abstracts","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Yet, conventional TMS configurations affect primarily neurons that are aligned parallel to the induced electric field by a fixed coil, making the activation orientation-specific. A novel method termed rotational field TMS (rfTMS), where two orthogonal coils are operated with a 90\u00B0 phase shift, produces rotation of the electric field vector over almost a complete cycle, and may stimulate larger portion of the neuronal population within a given brain area. OBJECTIVE To compare the physiological effects of rfTMS and conventional unidirectional TMS (udTMS) in the motor cortex. METHODS Hand and leg resting motor thresholds (rMT), and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and latencies (at 120% of rMT), were measured using a dual-coil array based on the H7-coil, in 8 healthy volunteers following stimulation at different orientations of either udTMS or rfTMS. RESULTS For both target areas rfTMS produced significantly lower rMTs and much higher MEPs than those induced by udTMS, for comparable induced electric field amplitude. Both hand and leg rMTs were orientation-dependent. CONCLUSIONS rfTMS induces stronger physiologic effects in targeted brain regions at significantly lower intensities. Importantly, given the activation of a much larger population of neurons within a certain brain area, repeated application of rfTMS may induce different neuroplastic effects in neural networks, opening novel research and clinical opportunities.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roth, Yiftach; Pell, Gaby S; Barnea-Ygael, Noam; Ankry, Moria; Hadad, Yafit; Eisen, Ami; Burnishev, Yuri; Tendler, Aron; Moses, Elisha; Zangen, Abraham","journal":"Brain stimulation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSIONS rfTMS","physiological effects of rfTMS","udTMS","rotational field TMS","repeated application of rfTMS","target areas rfTMS","electric field vector","comparable induced electric field amplitude","conventional unidirectional TMS","given brain area","conventional TMS configurations","different neuroplastic effects","certain brain area","lower rMTs","motor thresholds","larger population of neurons","novel research","leg rMTs","fixed coil","H7-coil","motor cortex","targeted brain regions","stronger physiologic effects","motor evoked potential","dual-coil array","activation orientation-specific","different orientations","neuronal population","novel method","lower intensities","larger portion","orientation-dependent","METHODS Hand","BACKGROUND Transcranial magnetic stimulation","neural networks","healthy volunteers","amplitudes","complete cycle","expanding technology","latencies","higher MEPs","neuropsychiatric treatments","clinical opportunities","RESULTS","phase shift","OBJECTIVE","orthogonal coils"],"language":"en"},

Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important ubiquitous pathogens of humans and animals. Since the late 1960\u0027s, human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized pathogens of the upper respiratory tract, being mainly associated with mild pathologies such as the common cold. However, in vulnerable populations, (newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals), they can affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic: neurons are often the target cell in the central nervous system (CNS), inducing neurodegeneration and eventually death. Moreover, HCoV can contribute to an overactivation of the immune system that could lead to autoimmunity in the CNS of susceptible individuals.

It can lead to activity limitations and participation restrictions that may include lost duty or work days. The objective of this systematic review is to determine which interventions are most effective in decreasing dizziness or vertigo and neck pain in military-aged adults with traumatic cervicogenic dizziness. METHODS The literature will be systematically searched using the following online databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Cochrane Methodology Register), CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and J-STAGE. The review will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs and controlled (non-randomized) clinical trials or cluster trials, and observational studies (including prospective and retrospective comparative cohort and case-control or nested case-control studies) and determine the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions for the treatment of traumatic cervicogenic dizziness in military-aged adults. Assessment of methodological quality will be performed by two independent, blinded reviewers using the PEDro scale. The level of evidence will be determined using the GRADE scale. The primary outcome measures will be change in dizziness and neck pain and disability from baseline to the last available follow-up, measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Neck Disability Index. Other relevant outcome measures will include self-reported change in symptoms, time to return to duty or work, and quality of life. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence on the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions for cervicogenic dizziness in a military-aged population. We anticipate our findings may inform individual treatment and future research. Clinical recommendations generated from this systematic review may inform military physical therapy treatment of individuals with cervicogenic dizziness. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION In accordance with the guidelines, our systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 21 January 2020 (registration number CRD42020150853). In the event of protocol amendments, the date of each amendment will be accompanied by a description of the change and the rationale.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoppes, Carrie W; Romanello, Anthony J; Gaudette, Kathryn E; Herron, William K; McCarthy, Anne E; McHale, Catherine J; Bares, Joan; Turner, Rose; Whitney, Susan L","journal":"Systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01335-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PEDro"],"organizations":["Dizziness Handicap Inventory"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decreasing dizziness","causes of dizziness","treatment of traumatic cervicogenic dizziness","systematic review protocol","SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION","BACKGROUND Traumatic cervicogenic dizziness","Dizziness Handicap Inventory","neck pain","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","military-aged adults","military physical therapy treatment of individuals","International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews","effectiveness of physical therapy interventions","military-aged population","cluster trials","clinical trials","Neck Disability Index","randomized controlled trials","Cochrane Library","Cochrane Methodology Register","individual treatment","cluster RCTs","nested case-control studies","self-reported change","relevant outcome measures","primary outcome measures","observational studies","lost duty","Clinical recommendations","work days","PEDro scale","quality of life","GRADE scale","level of evidence","event of protocol amendments","Assessment of methodological quality","registration number CRD42020150853","EMBASE","retrospective comparative cohort","MEDLINE","CINAHL","time","vertigo","guidelines","participation restrictions","SCOPUS","symptoms","baseline","accordance","Web of Science","following online databases","blinded reviewers","date","available follow-up","PROSPERO","injury","future research","activity limitations","description","findings","J-STAGE","rationale","DISCUSSION","objective","METHODS","literature"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xuehua; Wang, Juanle; Zhang, Min; Wang, Xiaojie","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Yangtze River Delta","Pearl River Delta"],"keyphrases":["Public response","public sentiments","public help","terms of public opinion","related Weibo texts","relevant Weibo","number of Weibo texts","early stages of COVID","spatial distribution of COVID","surge of public demand","Sina-Weibo","epidemic-related information","different topics","sub-topics","epidemic prevention","relevant topics","grave global public health emergency","government","key epidemic areas","urban agglomerations","China","social media","hysteresis of social support","emergency agencies","emergency responses","Yangtze River Delta","Pearl River Delta","different developmental stages","significant social events","accurate response countermeasures","transboundary areas","terms of space","latent Dirichlet allocation model","Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration","classification model","allocation of medical resources","outbreak of Corona Virus Disease","random forest algorithm","control","topic extraction","Hebei","enormous pressure","hour intervals","convenient transportation","Wuhan","Twitter","microblogging system","trend","popularization","frequent daily discussions","Beijing-Tianjin","synchronization","main channel","large population","Temporal changes","post-disaster management","province level","crisis","findings","study","real world","timely dissemination","content","opinions","feelings","results"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods : The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results : Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation \u0026 conclusions : Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Nivedita; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Giri, Sidhartha; Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Dar, Lalit; Sugunan, A P; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Shastri, Jayanthi; Kaveri, Krishnasamy; Dutta, Shanta; Malhotra, Bharti; Jain, Amita; Nagamani, Kammilli; Shantala, G B; Raut, Sharmila; Vegad, M M; Sharma, Ajanta; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Manjunatha, Jayaswamy; Pathak, Manish; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Banu, Hasina; Sharma, Himanshu; Jain, Parul; Sunita, Pakalpati; Ambica, R; Fageria, Babita; Patel, Disha; Rajbongshi, Gitika; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Nagar, Anu; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Abraham, Priya","journal":"The Indian journal of medical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_594_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV"],"locations":["China","Republic","Singapore","Hong Kong","Thailand","South Korea","Kerala","India"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","symptomatic individuals","testing VRDLs","quarantined individuals","NIV","quick diagnosis of SARS","countrywide network of VRDLs","early countrywide diagnosis","early diagnosis of COVID","Sudden emergence of SARS","travel history","Pune","Government of India","case definition","tested negative","total","reported high morbidity","established screening","public health system of India","imported cases","novel coronavirus","parts of China","outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology","Hubei province of Wuhan","novel viral strain","People\u0027s Republic of China","severe acute respiratory syndrome","E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","ICMR","Hong Kong","Japan","Indian Council of Medical Research","rRT-PCR","National Institute of Virology","seaport","international airport","unsurmountable challenge","Thailand","Singapore","confirmatory assays","well-coordinated action","concerted efforts of various arms","presence","South Korea","objectives","conclusions","Kerala","ability","past performance","week of standardization","pandemic","level","Methods","Interpretation","view","basis","different districts","role","Results","Background","occasions","potential","disease","camps","samples","month","countries","days"],"language":"en"},

In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods : Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results : Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation \u0026 conclusions : The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadav, Pragya D; Potdar, Varsha A; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Agrawal, Megha; Jadhav, Santosh M; Majumdar, Triparna D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Basu, Atanu; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah S","journal":"The Indian journal of medical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_663_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["sequences of Indian SARS-CoV","Indian sequences","sequences of new cases","suspected cases","identified B","identified positive cases","linear B-cell epitopes","predicted T-cell epitopes","prediction of B","Indian population","Phylogenetic analysis","B supertypes predominant","genomes of case","RdRp","affected countries","Throat swab","E gene","different introductions","different clusters","genetic evolution","genetic heterogeneity","nasal swab specimens","receptor-binding domain","S1 domain of spike protein","Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus","N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions","broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage","accession number","identity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","total","molecular characterization","China","design of vaccines","future experiments","travel history","rates of substitution","Ministry of Health","conformational epitope","Methods","generation sequencing","Family Welfare","nucleotides","advisory","fragmented genome","Continuous monitoring","study","conclusions","objectives","diagnostics","country","Results","Interpretation","Background"],"language":"en"},

There are apparent dissimilarities in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 cases in different parts of world. Developing countries in Asia and Africa with fragile health system have shown lower incidence and mortality compared to developed countries with superior health system in Europe and America. Most countries in Asia and Africa have national BCG vaccination program while Europe and America do not have such program, or have ceased it. At present, there is no known therapy to treat COVID-19 disease. There is no vaccine available currently to prevent COVID- 19 disease. As mathematical modelling is ideal for predicting the rate of disease transmission as well as evaluating efficacy of possible public health prevention measures, we have created a mathematical model with seven compartments to understand nationwide BCG vaccine recommendation on COVID-19 transmission, severity and mortality. We have computed two basic reproduction number, one at vaccine free equilibrium point and other at non-vaccine free equilibrium point and carried out local stability, sensitivity and numerical analysis. Our result showed that individuals with BCG vaccinations have lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection, shorter hospital stays, and increased rate of recovery. Furthermore, countries with long-standing universal BCG vaccination policies have reduced incidence, mortality, and severity of COVID-19. Further research will focus on exploring the immediate benefits of vaccination to healthcare workers and patients as well as benefits of BCG re-vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, N.

The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: In an Institutional Review Board approved study performed at a single, tertiary care academic medical center, the medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. We determined the frequency of VDI among COVID-19 patients to evaluate the likelihood of a VDI-COVID-19 relationship. Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients with serum 25OHD levels were identified; 65.0% required ICU admission.The VDI prevalence in ICU patients was 84.6%, vs. 57.1% in floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. Coagulopathy was present in 62.5% of ICU COVID-19 patients, and 92.3% were lymphocytopenic. Conclusions: VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction. Thus, we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Frank H.; Majumder, Rinku; Torabi, Radbeh; Saeg, Fouad; Hoffman, Ryan; Cirillo, Jeffrey D.; Greiffenstein, Patrick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0527c337e888676911931b226c0cd8795ee43709.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20075838v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Institutional Review Board"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VDI-COVID","ICU COVID","severe COVID","ICU patients","prevalence of VDI","VDI prevalence","floor patients","medical records of COVID","underlying driver of COVID","frequency of VDI","randomized controlled studies of VDI","ICU admission","severe disease","serum","Coagulopathy","OHD levels","relevant data","divergent outcomes","disease course","tertiary care academic medical center","intensive care unit","Emerging health disparities data","obesity","homeless populations","advanced age","concentration","male sex","northern climates","share numerous associations","hypertension","Institutional Review Board approved study","vitamin D insufficiency","symptoms","years old","immune dysfunction","Methods","mechanisms","remainder","hydroxycholecalcifoerol","severity","link","likelihood","Conclusions","major pandemic","relationship","Results","Subjects","lymphocytopenic","Background","people"],"language":"en"},

The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that a \u0022brute-force\u0022 approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Humphrey, L.; Thommes, E.

Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don\u0027t stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients. Results: 1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effectAmong 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital.

The effectiveness of vaccination also depends on the induced immune response. Currently there is no method to measure the cellular immune response in blood samples. The functional activity of cells of innate and adaptive immune system is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways. Using a previously described approach we developed mRNA-based tests to measure activity of these signaling pathways, and show that they can be used to measure in a quantitative manner the cellular innate and adaptive immune response to a viral infection or vaccine in whole blood, PBMC, and specific immune cell type samples. Pathway activity level and range in healthy individuals was established, enabling interpretation of a pathway activity score on a patient sample without the need for a reference sample. Evidence is presented that the pathway activity analysis may also be useful for in vitro vaccine development and assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. Other envisioned applications lie in development of immunomodulatory drugs and drug response prediction and monitoring. Tests are expected to be of value in the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests for measuring host immune response, qPCR-based versions are in development; the latter can in principle be performed within three hours in routine hospital labs.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouwman, Wilbert; Verhaegh, Wim; Holtzer, Laurent; van de Stolpe, Anja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20f73c6c25ddb11e7cf6f26981a7d9bb829503f6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.092759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC","Affymetrix"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptive immune response","cellular immune response","host immune response","induced immune response","Pathway activity level","pathway activity score","pathway activity analysis","coordinated activity","adaptive immune system","vaccine development","drug response prediction","functional activity of cells","viral infection","specific immune cell type samples","described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests","mRNA-based tests","blood samples","development of immunomodulatory drugs","qPCR-based versions","assessment of vaccine immunogenicity","JAK-STAT pathways","patient sample","described approach","reference sample","case of COVID","PBMC","clinical course","healthy individuals","range","interpretation","quantitative manner","hours","need","monitoring","example","envisioned applications","routine hospital labs","addition","value","method","crisis","effectiveness of vaccination","principle","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role. Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data, with hot spots in all five boroughs. Spatial risk did not correspond precisely to population-based rates of positive tests. The strongest univariate association with positive testing rates was the proportion of residents in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of COPD in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). The next strongest association was with the proportion of Black and African American residents, for which there was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7). Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons. Conclusions. The population and spatial patterns of COVID-19 infections differ by race, age, physical environment and health status. Areas with large proportions of Black/African American residents are at markedly higher risk that is not fully explained by characteristics of the environment and pre-existing conditions in the population.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiMaggio, C.; Klein, M.; Berry, C.; Frangos, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5798d5f84c71974797fc08016b1565cb2ff107b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101691v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas","Black/African American"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive COVID","proportion of Black","Spatial risk","African American residents","proportion of residents older","spatial characteristics of COVID","spatial patterns of COVID","positive testing rates","African American race","proportion of older persons","Spatial clustering","higher risk","population-based rates of positive tests","approximate doubling of risk","housing density","testing results","heart disease","fold increase","ZCTA","age","large proportions of Black","racial characteristics","infections","unit increase","strongest association","Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models","Incidence Density Ratio","strongest univariate association","New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","scaled standardized measure of COPD","physical environment","demographic","integrated nested Laplace approximations","individual clinical factors","variables","addition","estimates","chance","probability greater","health status","community","pre-existing conditions","hot spots","important role","Credible Interval","multivariable model","data","evidence","variation","boroughs","IDR","Introduction","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The OncoSim-Breast model simulates the onset, growth and spread of invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ tumours. The model combines Canadian cancer incidence, mortality, screening program and cost data to project population-level outcomes. Users can change the model input to answer specific policy questions. Here we report three validation exercises. First, we compared the model\u0027s projected breast cancer incidence and stage distributions with the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry. Second, we compared OncoSim\u0027s projected breast cancer mortality with Vital Statistics. Third, we replicated the UK Age trial to compare the model\u0027s projections with the trial\u0027s observed screening effects. Results: OncoSim-Breast\u0027s projected incidence, mortality and stage distribution of breast cancer were close to the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry and the Vital Statistics. OncoSim-Breast also reproduced the breast cancer screening effects observed in the UK Age trial.

While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events. Methods: Confirmed cases reported by SSA countries were line-listed to capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries. Data were retrieved from publicly available sources, including institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts, with supplementary details obtained from news articles. A data availability score was calculated for each imported case in terms of how many indicators (sex, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected) could be identified. We assessed the relationship between time to first importation and overall Global Health Security Index (GHSI) using Cox regression. K-means clustering grouped countries according to healthcare capacity and health and demographic risk factors. Results: A total of 2417 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 30 days after the first known introduction to the region. Out of the 876 cases for which information was publicly available, 677 (77.3%) were considered importation events. At the regional level, imported cases tended to be male (67.3%), were a median 43.0 years old (Range: 6 weeks - 88 years), and most frequently had recent travel history from Europe (43.3%). The median time to reporting an introduction was 19 days; a country\u0027s time to report its first importation was not related to GHSI. Mean data availability scores were lowest for countries that had, on average, the highest case fatality rates, lowest healthcare capacity, and highest probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases. Conclusion: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or are reporting with limited public availability of information. Reporting of information on COVID detection and response efforts, as well as on trends in non-COVID illness and care-seeking behavior, is critical to assessing direct and indirect consequences and capacity needs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract The French-language Respiratory Medicine Society proposes a guide for the follow-up of patients who have presented with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The proposals are based on known data from previous epidemics, on acute lesions observed in SARS-CoV-2 patients and on expert opinion. This guide proposes a follow-up based on three categories of patients: 1) patients managed outside hospital for possible or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, referred by their physician for persistent dyspnoea; 2) patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a medical unit; 3) patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in an intensive care unit. The subsequent follow-up will have to be adapted to the initial assessment. This guide emphasises the possibility of others causes of dyspnoea (cardiac, thromboembolic, hyperventilation syndrome..). These proposals may evolve over time as more knowledge becomes available.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrejak, Cl; Blanc, F-X; Costes, F.; Crestani, B.; Perez, Th; Philippe, B.; Plantier, L.; Schlemmer, F.; Sese, L.; Stach, B.; Uzunhan, Y.; Zanetti, C.; Zysman, M.; Raherison, C.; Maitre, B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ff15e4cbdd2b8f9527d0324be2cd9b96c25107.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842520301637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842520301637?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Respiratory Medicine Society"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV","patients hospitalized","proven SARS","patients who","type de patients","the follow","The proposals","presented with SARS","The subsequent follow","This guide emphasises the possibility","patients managed outside hospital for possible","acute lesions observed in SARS","pneumonie","Abstract The French","patient hospitalis\u00E9","to be adapted to the initial assessment","dyspnoea","based","causes de dyspn\u00E9e","infection","hyperventilation syndrome","fait","pneumonia in an intensive care","others causes","dyspn\u00E9e persistante","bilan initial","suivi respiratoire","suivi ult\u00E9rieur","These proposals may evolve over time as more knowledge becomes available","will","from previous epidemics","language Respiratory Medicine","pr\u00E9c\u00E9dentes \u00E9pid\u00E9mies","cardiac","known","l\u00E9sions aigu\u00EBs constat\u00E9es","m\u00E9decin traitant","thromboembolic","referred","medical","Langue Fran\u00E7aise","three categories","unit\u00E9 conventionnelle","donn\u00E9es connues","their physician","ville","Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 de Pneumologie","temps","fil des connaissances","charge","opinions","expert opinion","sujet","conduite","s\u00E9jour","experts","r\u00E9animation","propositions"],"language":"fr"},

A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was also developed to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, and were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change {\u002B/-}100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7{\u002B/-}28.7, mean{\u002B/-}SD), taste (-69.0{\u002B/-}32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3{\u002B/-}36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parma, V.; Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M.

As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effects of nCoVN to human stem cells, genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) expressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems, in which the expression of nCoVN could be induced by the doxycycline. The proliferation rate of iPSC-nCoVN was decreased. Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC started to change after nCoVN expression for 7 days. The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Zebin; Wu, Zhiming; Mai, Jinlian; Zhou, Lishi; Qian, Yu; Cai, Tian; Chen, Zhenhua; Wang, Ping; Lin, Bin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/630b77ead07fab4a1b7f4e142ae1677b6ffb4e5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.010694","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iPSC-nCoVN","expression of nCoVN","nCoVN expression","morphology of iPSC","biological effects of nCoVN","pluripotent properties of iPSC","proliferation rate of iPSC","RNA-seq data of iPSC","SARS-CoV","human stem cells","pluripotent stem cells","types of cells","days","nucleocapsid protein of SARS","pathogenic mechanism of SARS","lentiviral expression systems","engineered human","viral genome","day induction","routine differentiation protocol","global mortality rate","World Health Organization","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","therapeutic target","pandemic","cardiomyocytes","new insight","immunofluorescence assays","functions","ability","potential vaccine","fibroblast","pluripotency marker TRA","COVID","doxycycline"],"language":"en"},

Here we investigate the function of the mRNA stem loop 5\u2032 of the take-off codon, as well as the importance of ribosome loading density on the mRNA for efficient bypassing. We show that polysomes are less efficient at mediating bypassing than monosomes, both in vitro and in vivo, due to their preventing formation of a stem loop 5\u2032 of the take-off codon and allowing greater peptidyl-tRNA drop off. A ribosome profiling analysis of phage T4 infected E. coli yielded protected mRNA fragments within the normal size range derived from ribosomes stalled at the take-off codon. However, ribosomes at this position also yielded some 53 nucleotide fragments, 16 longer. These were due to protection of the nucleotides that form the 5\u2032 stem loop. NMR shows that the 5\u2032 stem loop is highly dynamic. The importance of different nucleotides in the 5\u2032 stem loop is revealed by mutagenesis studies. These data highlight the significance of the 5\u2032 stem loop for the 50 nt bypassing, and further enhance appreciation of relevance of the extent of ribosome loading for recoding.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Loughlin, Sin\u00E9ad; Capece, Mark C.; Klimova, Mariia; Wills, Norma M.; Coakley, Arthur; Samatova, Ekaterina; O\u0027Connor, Patrick B.F.; Loughran, Gary; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Baranov, Pavel V.; Rodnina, Marina V.; Puglisi, Joseph D.; Atkins, John F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c643c7dfd1383dcb16e4ef5e98b208b58483ef7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283620303466; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620303466?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA stem loop","efficient bypassing","take-off codon","mediating bypassing","importance of ribosome","Abstract Efficient translational bypassing","protected mRNA fragments","extent of ribosome","ribosomes","ribosome profiling analysis of phage T4 infected","importance of different nucleotides","nucleotide fragments","phage T4 topoisomerase subunit gene","recoding signals","nt non-coding gap","gp60","coli","normal size range","density","greater peptidyl-tRNA","appreciation of relevance","position","monosomes","polysomes","significance","preventing formation","mutagenesis studies","function","data","protection","NMR"],"language":"en"},

Materials and Methods Thirty-six Holstein bull calves (1 d of age) from a commercial calf ranch were assigned to either a high plane of milk-replacer nutrition (HPN; n = 18; 20 and 28% DM lipid and protein, respectively, Cow\u2019s Match, Land O\u2019Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co., Shoreview, MN) or a low plane of milk-replacer nutrition (LPN; n = 18; 20% DM lipid and protein, Herd Maker, Land O\u2019Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co.) through weaning. Total serum protein concentrations confirmed that 72 and 76% of calves had failure of passive transfer (\u003C5.2 g/dL) in HPN and LPN, respectively. All calves were bottle fed twice daily. The LPN were fed 455 g of DM/d of milk replacer (MR) until weaning, and the HPN calves were fed 830 g of DM/d of milk replacer during the first 10 d and 1,080 g from 11 d until weaning. Calf starter and water were offered ad libitum. Calves were step-down weaned beginning at 51 d and completely weaned after 58 d when consuming 1 kg of calf starter (as-fed basis). Data are reported as HPN versus LPN throughout, respectively. Results and Discussion Risk for bloat and scouring were greater for calves fed the HPN, but there was no difference in antibiotic treatment or mortality. The HPN calves had greater performance over the preweaning period including final BW, ADG, and feed:gain (total kg of milk replacer \u002B calf starter, kg of DM/kg of BW gain), but weaning was more stressful for HPN calves. Implications and Applications In conclusion, the high-risk calves fed a HPN had increased preweaning ADG, but there was also an increased incidence of scours. There may be differences in the health status of calves that may affect the ability to consume and use high MR levels. When feeding high-risk calves there may be a need for alternate strategies when determining the quality and quantity of MR being fed when compared with low-risk calves. Differences in gut integrity may influence the ability of high-risk calves to handle high levels of MR early in life. Potential issues with high-risk calves being fed a HPN might be reduced with increased feeding times per day, a gradual step-up method, or other nutritional strategies that improve gastrointestinal development and function.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharon, K.

Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug\u2013target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug\u2013target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug\u2013target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug\u2013target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements.

Although efficacy have not been proven, lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily has been proposed as a treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19. Previously published cohorts showed Covid-19 is associated with major inflammation. To date, no data are available regarding lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentration and its safety in Covid-19 patients. Methods: Real-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective cohort study Results: On the cohort of 31 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR 2.9-6.4), with regards to average plasma concentrations in HIV treatment. All except two patients were above the upper limit of the concentration ranges of HIV treatment. In this cohort, about one over four to five patients prematurely stopped lopinavir/ritonavir therapy due to a moderate adverse drug reaction, mainly hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: Patients with Covid-19 pneumonitis treated with lopinavir/ritonavir have plasma concentrations dramatically higher than expected. Owing to that high plasma concentration may be required for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, it appears that lopinavir dosage should not be reduced in the absence of adverse effect. About 80% of the patients well tolerated lopinavir/ritonavir therapy under these plasma concentrations. However, cautious is necessary as drug repurposing can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chouchana, L.; Boujaafar, S.; Gana, I.; Preta, L.-H.; Regard, L.; Legendre, P.; Azoulay, C.; Canoui\u00CC\u0088, E.; Zerbit, J.; Carlier, N.; Terrier, B.; Kerneis, S.; Batista, R.; Treluyer, J.-M.; Zheng, Y.; Benaboud, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a17bdcd3c3e268ce2a27a487b2c4be1ac40118b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20105650v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IQR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","ritonavir plasma concentration","high lopinavir plasma concentrations","tolerated lopinavir","lopinavir dosage","ritonavir therapy","Real-world Covid","severe Covid","average plasma concentrations","high plasma concentration","treatment of moderate","concentration ranges of HIV treatment","moderate adverse drug reaction","drug repurposing","urgent need of active treatment","new drug safety profile","retrospective cohort study Results","absence of adverse effect","experience","coronavirus disease","antiviral activity","upper limit","data","regards","pneumonitis","gastrointestinal disorders","SARS-CoV","Methods","Background","date","fold","published cohorts","Conclusion","major inflammation","IQR","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore the beneficial effects of a lockdown keep reducing the new cases with a linear trend for at least the ten successive days.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfano, V.; Ercolano, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.12.20062695v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lockdown"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of lockdown measures","policies","world","new cases","reduction of cases","beneficial effects","successive days","Coronavirus pandemic outbreak","means","terms","effective need","linear trend","preliminary evidences","panel data quantitative analysis","optimal duration","average time","alt","note","China","debate","order","high price","productive activities","National governments","probability","results","aim"],"language":"en"},

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. We estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Re of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re=0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45-0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Re is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities. Our approach is based on the mechanistic-statistical formalism, which uses a probabilistic model to connect the data collection process and the latent epidemiological process, which is described by a SIR-type differential equation model.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roques, Lionel; Klein, Etienne K; Papaix, Julien; Sar, Antoine; Soubeyrand, Samuel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31ad889cf72119d41aea910b88e0b57d2aa45132.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074054v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","France"],"keyphrases":["lockdown","epidemic wave","France","COVID","beginning","fraction","probabilistic model","low value","pandemic stage","early stage","data collection process","latent epidemiological process","effective reproduction number","number of recovered individuals","total French population","SIR-type differential equation model","contact rate","account","mechanistic-statistical formalism","Hubei province","infectious cases","official date","saturation of hospital facilities","China","herd immunity","world","reduction","factor","approach","estimates","proportion","countries"],"language":"en"},

By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of SAR-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moustafa, A.; Aziz, R.

In severe cases, the presence of kidney injury is associated with increased risk of death, highlighting the relevance of this organ as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation. The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death. In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noris, Marina; Benigni, Ariela; Remuzzi, Giuseppe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8dd5049ae24480148034f394a8bc57a7ae473c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820305561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820305561?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complement system","associated tissue injury","acute kidney injury","associated tissue inflammation","cardiac injury","presence of kidney injury","unrestrained activation of complement","endothelial cells","chronic inflammation","aggressive inflammation","different complement activation products","pathogenesis of COVID","intravascular coagulation","host immune system","terminal complement pathway","multi-organ damage","SARS-CoV","severe cases","organs","viral infection","lungs","inflammatory host immune response","lung parenchymal cells","multiple organ failure","treatment of lung","major role","relative role","multiorgan damage","target of SARS","novel coronavirus disease COVID","endothelial cell dysfunction","increased risk of death","diminishing oxygen uptake","thrombus formation","prevention","endotheliitis","hypercytokinemia","potential therapeutic option","result","thrombotic events","relevance","hypothesis","thrombosis","evidence","review"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this systematic scoping review was to identify and summarize the scientific evidences promoting the use of AMs for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic search engines (PubMed and Web of Science) was performed. In addition, freewheeling searches of the government health ministries and government websites was done to retrieve the available information. Records available until 12th March 2020 were considered. Reports proposing the use of AMs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 across all countries were included.

The PRAM aggregates the data for each of these geographic regions based on disease prevalence acceleration and health care resource utilization acceleration, producing real time analysis of the acceleration of change for each metric individually and also combined into a single weighted index, the PRAM Recovery Index.

Five coronaviruses currently infect humans: HCoVs 229E and OC43, identified in the 1960s, SARS-CoV identified in March 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and the HCoVs NL63 and HKU1, identified in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features: the generation of multiple mutants during the replication resulting on a quasispecies structure of the viral population, the demonstrated ability of coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the flexibility of the genome due to a high frequency of homologue or heterologue recombinations, the ability to jump barrier species and to adapt to the new environment. Two epidemiologic pictures of HCoV infections have to be distinguished: as suggested by recent studies, HCoVs except SARS-CoV, are distributed worldwide and cocirculate during seasonal outbreaks. The distribution of the different HCoV species varies according to the geographic area and season. In contrast, the SARS-CoV is responsible of the first emerging infectious disease of this millennium, infecting more than 8000 people between November 2002 and July 2003. Its circulation has been stopped by drastic public health policy. Human coronaviruses may be also involved in enteric and neurologic diseases. The detection of these viruses is difficult and mainly based on molecular assays (RT-PCR). There is no established specific therapy to date.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Brison, E.; Brouard, J.; Freymuth, F.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaacfa539d60bd753e7f00560abd53f811ace38b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811408000436; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811408000436","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Les"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ann\u00E9es et","mammif\u00E8res et","et juillet","infections \u00E0 HCoV","NL63 et HKU1","E et OC43","et fait appel surtout \u00E0","hors SARS-CoV","SARS epidemic","SARS-CoV identifi\u00E9 en mars","recombinaisons homologues et h\u00E9t\u00E9rologues","capacit\u00E9 \u00E0 franchir","capacit\u00E9 \u00E0 \u00E9tablir","pathologies digestives et neurologiques reste \u00E0 pr\u00E9ciser","HCoV dans","different HCoV species","barri\u00E8res d\u2019esp\u00E8ces et \u00E0 s\u2019adapter au nouvel environnement","virus responsables d\u2019infections respiratoires hautes et basses","sont ubiquitaires et circulent sous forme \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","epidemiologic pictures of HCoV infections","Abstract Coronaviruses","Human coronaviruses","\u00E9t\u00E9 interrompue gr\u00E2ce \u00E0","demonstrated ability of coronaviruses","virus infectant","mise en","infections persistantes","persistent infections","HCoVs NL63","virus \u00E9mergent responsable","diff\u00E9rents HCoV co-circulent avec une distribution entre","virus envelopp\u00E9s dont","l\u2019\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","responsable d\u2019une distribution en quasi-esp\u00E8ces","g\u00E9nome est une mol\u00E9cule d\u2019ARN","identifi\u00E9s respectivement en","Ce sont essentiellement","est variable selon","coronavirus forment","lot of species","barrier species","genome","nombreux mutants lors","large group of viruses","polarit\u00E9 positive","population virale","viral population","grande flexibilit\u00E9","Sa circulation","tr\u00E8s grande taille","generation of multiple mutants","pneumopathies atypiques entre novembre","positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule","Leur mode \u00E9volutif fait intervenir plusieurs param\u00E8tres","oiseaux","types","cinq d\u2019entre eux infectent l\u2019homme","d\u00E9tresse respiratoire aigu s\u00E9v\u00E8re","r\u00E9plication","grand groupe","fort taux","syndrome","g\u00E9n\u00E9ration","Il n\u2019existe actuellement aucun traitement sp\u00E9cifique","connus depuis","d\u00E9l\u00E9tions importantes","possibilit\u00E9","heterologue recombinations","techniques mol\u00E9culaires","replication","high frequency of homologue","lui","r\u00E9gions g\u00E9ographiques","emerging infectious disease","mesures sanitaires drastiques","molecular assays","millennium","quasispecies structure","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","L\u2019implication","features","humans","drastic public health policy","geographic area","recent studies","established specific therapy","date","RT-PCR","mammals","birds","cocirculate","flexibility","d\u00E9tection","neurologic diseases","seasonal outbreaks","detection","contrast","new environment","people","evolution"],"language":"en"},

In the current study we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly after a single intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS. Upon MERS-CoV challenge vaccinated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction in viral load in lung tissue of several logs. Furthermore, we did not detect MERS-CoV replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. Finally, we investigated the ability of ChAdOx1 MERS to protect against six different MERS-CoV strains, isolated between 2012 to 2018, from dromedary camels and humans in the Middle East and Africa. Antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques were able to neutralize all MERS-CoV strains.

WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher transmission/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200 cases of COVID-19 till 18th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries. The malaria free countries not only have higher density of COVID-19 infections but also the higher case fatality rates as compared to highly malaria endemic countries. We also postulate that this phenomenon is due to natural immune response against malaria infection, which is providing a heterologous protection against the virus. Unfortunately, there is no licensed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 yet, but this information will be helpful in design of future strategies against fast spreading COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muneer, A.; Kumari, K.; Tripathi, M.; Srivastava, R.; Mohmmed, A.; Rathore, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5473f12730cedf1950cd4eab7b488b28346286e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20097923v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["malaria infection","malaria free countries","malaria endemic countries","malaria endemicity of respective countries","cases of COVID","higher density of COVID","number of COVID","lower rate of infection","SARS-CoV","CoronaVirus Disease","higher transmission","higher levels","mild trend of infection","higher case fatality rates","spread","lockdown strategies","death rates","design of future strategies","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","health infrastructure","demographics","infections","prevalence of protozoan parasite","terms of healthcare facilities","mitigation efforts","natural immune response","cultural habits","population","Hubei province of China","phenomenon","licensed vaccine","surprising observation","heterologous protection","parts","information","wildfire","world","issue"],"language":"en"},

The majority of countries with significant outbreaks introduced social distancing or \u0022lockdown\u0022 measures to reduce viral transmission. The key question now in many countries is when, how, and to what extent these measures can be lifted. By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21st April 2020, and covered 67 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling. The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with Spain having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.71 (95%CI 0.65-0.78) based on cases and 0.81 (95%CI 0.77-0.85) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lonergan, M.; Chalmers, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20080994v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Spain","France"],"keyphrases":["majority of countries","sufficient data","publically available data","largest number of cases available","Spain","resurgence","Intermittent lockdown","estimates of R0","control measures","mortality","rapid reductions - R0","reproduction number","economic activity","analysis","doubling times","Italy","trajectories","USA","social distancing","significant outbreaks","daily numbers","fitting regression models","periods of increase freedom","France","week","month unrestricted","restrictions","UK","viral transmission","little evidence","places","epidemic","means","modelling","key question","disease","lockdowns","extent","COVID"],"language":"en"},

We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter.

The infectious disease has spread globally and become a major threat to public health. Purpose: We aim to investigate the ultra-high-resolution CT (UHR-CT) findings of imported COVID-19 related pneumonia from the initial diagnosis to early-phase follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study included confirmed cases with early-stage COVID-19 related pneumonia imported from the epicenter. Initial and early-phase follow-up UHR-CT scans (within 5 days) were reviewed for characterizing the radiological findings. The normalized total volumes of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were calculated and compared during the radiological follow-up by artificial-intelligence-based methods. Results: Eleven patients (3 males and 8 females, aged 32-74 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. Subpleural GGOs with inter/intralobular septal thickening were typical imaging findings. Other diagnostic CT features included distinct margins (8/11, 73%), pleural retraction or thickening (7/11, 64%), intralesional vasodilatation (6/11, 55%). Normalized volumes of pulmonary GGOs (p=0.003) and consolidations (p=0.003) significantly increased during the CT follow-up. Conclusions: The abnormalities of GGOs with peripleural distribution, consolidated areas, septal thickening, pleural involvement and intralesional vasodilatation on UHR-CT indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19.

The present study examined this hypothesis using statistical approaches based on the public data. Three approaches were utilized: 1) comparing the infection and mortality ratio of people on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, 2) comparing the number of mortalities among nations, and 3) comparing the maximum daily increase rate of total mortalities among nations. The result of 1) showed that there is no significant difference in infection per person onboard and mortality-infection between Japanese citizens vs. other nationalities and BCG obligatory nations vs. non-BCG obligatory nations on the Diamond Princess. The result of 2) showed that the number of mortalities among nations is similar to the previous studies, but this analysis also considered the timing of COVID-19 arrival in each nation. After correcting for arrival time, previously reported effect of BCG vaccination on decreasing total mortality disappeared. This is because nations that lack BCG vaccination are concentrated in Western Europe, which is near an epicenter of COVID-19. Therefore some previous reports are now considered to be affected by this artifact; the result may have been flawed by on-land dispersal from an epicenter. However, some results showed weakly significant differences in the number of deaths at a particular time among BCG obligatory and non-BCG nations (especially the use of Japanese BCG strain Tokyo 172). However, these results are affected by the results of three countries and the effect of BCG vaccination remains inconclusive. The result of 3) showed that the maximum daily increasing rate in death among nations showed no significant difference among BCG vaccination policies. In the present study, although some results showed statistically significant differences among BCG vaccination policies, they may be affected by the impact of various other factors, such as national infection-control policies, social distancing, behavioral changes of people, possible previous local epidemics of closely related viruses, or inter-population differences in ACE2 or other genetic polymorphism. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying cause of the observed differences in infection and mortality of the disease among nations. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of BCG vaccination, if any, can be masked by many other factors. Therefore, the possible effect might be relatively small. In fact, in Japan, where almost all citizens have been vaccinated, COVID-19 cases are constantly increasing. Given the importance of peoples behavior in preventing viral propagation, the spread of optimism triggered by this hypothesis would be harmful to BCG vaccination nations.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asahara, Masakazu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba30cb3051316d70b0b8a60667d07a64bfa6d6b8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20068601v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diamond Princess","BCG"],"locations":["Western Europe"],"keyphrases":["BCG vaccination nations","non-BCG nations","BCG vaccination policies","non-BCG obligatory nations","reported effect of BCG vaccination","mortality-infection","results","use of Japanese BCG strain Tokyo","weakly significant differences","total mortality","possible effect","number of mortalities","epicenter of COVID","national infection-control policies","observed differences","severity of COVID","timing of COVID","mortality ratio of people","inter-population differences","maximum daily increase rate of total mortalities","Japanese citizens","number of deaths","maximum daily increasing rate","previous studies","controversial hypothesis","arrival time","previous reports","present study","factors","possible previous local epidemics","particular time","cruise ship Diamond Princess","statistical approaches","behavioral changes of people","related viruses","social distancing","nationalities","person onboard","Bacillus Calmette-Guerin","viral propagation","ACE2","spread of optimism","analysis","importance of peoples behavior","countries","genetic polymorphism","underlying cause","Western Europe","public data","disease","impact of various","land dispersal","artifact","cases","research"],"language":"en"},

Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in health care workplace is recommended as a high priority. In order to investigate the relationship between PPE use and the number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study among 142 HCWs who were dispatched from Hefei to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei, China; both provided care for patients with COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody (IgM, IgG, IgA) detection were performed to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection among those HCWs. We also extracted publicly released data on daily number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, daily number of HCWs who were dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, and daily production of PPE in China and daily demand and supply of PPE in Hubei province. Our laboratory testing confirmed that none of the 142 HCWs who were dispatched to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with these findings, as of April 15, 2020, none of the 42,600 HCWs who were successively dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, 2020 was reported to have COVID-19. These HCWs were provided with adequate supply of PPE as committed by their original institutions or provinces. In contrast, during the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, a substantial shortage of PPE and an increasing number of COVID-19 infection among HCWs were reported. With the continuing increase in domestic production of PPE in China, the PPE supply started to meet and then exceed the demand. This coincided with a subsequent reduction in the number of reported COVID-19 cases among HCWs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that COVID-19 infection among HCWs could be completely prevented. Appropriate and adequate PPE might play a crucial role in protecting HCWs against COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wei; Min, Yuan-Zeng; Yang, Chun-Mei; Hong, Hai-Ou; Xue, Tian; Gao, Yong; Jin, Tengchuan; Lu, Zhao-Hui; Zhang, Liang-Ming; Zheng, Xueying; Luo, Sihui; Bao, Wei; Weng, Jian-Ping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac878caa15639228d7e5959db19f1cd854b78639.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20070169v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["Hefei","China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["daily number of HCWs","daily number of COVID","PPE supply","number of reported COVID","adequate PPE","PPE use","increasing number of COVID","daily production of PPE","infection","adequate supply of PPE","domestic production of PPE","early phase of COVID","Hubei province","substantial shortage of PPE","China","cases","SARS-CoV","daily demand","Hefei","health care workers","health care workplace","findings","Wuhan","laboratory testing","Nucleic acid testing","IgM","epidemic","specific antibody","IgG","major challenge","crucial role","IgA","detection","continuing increase","personal protective equipment","relationship","molecular epidemiological study","subsequent reduction","original institutions","pandemic","patients","data","high priority","provinces","contrast","order","coronavirus disease","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Application of our models to COVID-19 spread in Sweden shows how the proposed methods could substantially decrease the peak number of infected people, almost without increasing the duration of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sedov, Leonid; Krasnochub, Alexander; polishchuk, valentin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/793aa2078bfffada2c26f4a2cc4e1538bbac41b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.15.20067025v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["tests","classical SIR epidemic spread model","extended model","proportion of infected population","peak number of infected people","proposed methods","COVID","Sweden","mass-testing","infection","drone fleet","drones","models","time","curve","quarantining","differential equations","Application","metropolitan area","potential","duration","compartment"],"language":"en"},

However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections. Objectives. To assess whether children with brain-based developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have complications or poorer outcomes following infection. Methods. We conducted a two-week rapid review on studies with primary data regarding children aged between zero and 18 years old with brain-based developmental disabilities, or who were at risk of developing such disabilities, with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We performed our literature searches on April 18, 2020. Results. Our search strategy identified 538 individual records, of which four were included in our review.

They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for 1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the spread of epidemics.","publish_time":"2008-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cr\u0027epey, Pascal; Barth\u0027elemy, Marc","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97b4dd472085558128f140815ff6ae2eaf0e9d4b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3591v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","France"],"keyphrases":["method","authors","epidemic spread","United States","epidemic patterns","travel-induced correlations","spread of epidemics","strong short-range correlations","dominated disease spread","case of France","robust long-range spreading patterns","possible impact of travel restrictions","well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks","large domestic air-traffic flows","transportation mode","different regions","transmission channels","conclusions","human movement","null model","time","immediate neighbors","useful tool","results","regional scale","stability","simplicity","robustness","data","paper"],"language":"en"},

Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. Methods Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. Results (1) Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 microns). Particles were detected in 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF. (2) Chemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 microlitres/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 microlitres/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. Conclusion During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of microlitres per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet breathing. During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compares to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jermy, M.

This is obviously a major pitfall for evaluating and possibly controlling the current epidemic. Due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters has recently been proposed as a complementary tool to investigate the virus circulation in human populations. If this assumption is correct, SARS-CoV-2 relative amounts in wastewaters should correlate with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV2 by RT-qPCR in 23 raw and 8 treated wastewater samples collected from 3 major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area collecting 3 to 4 million inhabitants reject. This study was conducted from 5 March to 7 April 2020. All raw wastewater samples scored positive for SARS-CoV2. Additionally, 6 out of 8 samples from treated wastewater scored positive by RT-qPCR. Treated wastewater effluents showed a 100 times reduction in the viral load compared to the corresponding raw wastewater samples, which agrees with previous work on enteric viruses. We next compared the average level of SARS-CoV2 genomes in wastewater samples over time with the number of confirmed fatal cases of COVID19 in Paris area and in France As expected, we confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase in the number of fatal cases observed at the regional and national level Therefore, our study demonstrates that the contamination of wastewater and the detection of viral genome occurred before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. This work demonstrated that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for better survey of SARS-CoV2 circulation at the local or regional scale. Additionally, wastewater survey may provide an alternative and possibly early tool to detect pathogens in populations when investigations in humans is difficult for logistic, ethical or economic reasons.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wurtzer, Sebastien; Marechal, Vincent; Mouchel, Jean-Marie; Moulin, Laurent","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Paris","France"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV2","treated wastewater samples","presence of SARS","wastewater survey","corresponding raw wastewater samples","contamination of wastewater","better survey of SARS","quantitative monitoring of SARS","average level of SARS","Treated wastewater effluents","CoV2 circulation","stool samples qualitative detection of SARS","raw wastewaters","CoV2 genomes","major wastewater treatment plant","time-course quantitative analysis of SARS","number of fatal cases","human populations","number of confirmed COVID","fatal cases of COVID19","virus circulation","detection of viral genome","RT-qPCR","study","increase of genome units","massive human testing","viral load","Paris area","clinal COVID","Parisian area","early tool","previous work","regional scale","national level","complementary tool","major pitfall","current epidemic","humans","WWTP","additional information","times reduction","investigations","pathogens","beginning","relative amounts","economic reasons","exponential growth","enteric viruses","France","non-specific symptoms","assumption","carriers","inhabitants","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics.

Design: Retrospective case study of positive COVID inpatients between 3/20/2020-3/31/2020. Setting: Montefiore Health System main hospital, Moses, a large tertiary care center in the Bronx. Participants: Adult inpatients with positive COVID tests hospitalized at MHS. Exposure (for observational studies): Datasets of participants were queried for physiological, demographic (age, sex, socioeconomic status and self-reported race and/or ethnicity) and laboratory data. Main Outcome and Measures: Relationship and predictive value of measured parameters to mortality and illness severity. Results: Of the 217 in this case review, 70 died during hospitalization while 147 were discharged home. Only the admission PT and first D-Dimer could very significantly differentiate those who were discharged alive and those who died. Logistic regression analysis shows increased odds ratio for mortality by first D-Dimer within 48 hrs. of admission. The optimal cut-point for the initial D-Dimer to predict mortality was found to be 1.65 mcg/mL. Conclusions: We describe here a comprehensive assessment of hematologic and coagulation parameters in COVID and examine the relationship of these to mortality. We demonstrate that both initial and maximum D-Dimer values are biomarkers that can be used for survival assessments.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reyes Gil, M.; Gonzalez-Lugo, J.

Our modeling approach takes account of the asymptomatic ratio of crew members during the quarantine of passengers, which has not been explored in the literature.

Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff\u0027s health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garbey, M.; Joerger, G.; Furr, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/091ca53cbb170ee441dffff7c3951d1ef013cb25.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20097725v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surgical staff","Surgical smoke plumes","Airborne transmission of viruses","long-term effects of surgical smoke","airborne contamination","transmission of SARS","diffusion of hazardous airborne particles","airborne viral load","multi-scale modeling of surgical flow","marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation","large operating room suite","tissue particles","long-term exposure","human health","SARS-CoV","model estimates staff exposure","clinical study","clinical implication","systems approach","staff\u0027s health","hospital systems","thermal destruction of tissue","account human behavior factors","previous work","use of electrosurgical instruments","long period of time","network of air quality sensors","carrier","experimental protocol","physical point of view","biological material","mathematical framework","quantified metrics","paper","Measurements","validation","coronavirus","bacteria","droplet dynamics","debate","years","purpose","feet","disease"],"language":"en"},

Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are urgently needed. Methods: In this study, 43 COVID-19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed. Results: A total of 43 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9\u002B/-9.4 vs 44.4\u002B/-15.9) and had higher incidence in co-infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%). Significantly more severe patients had the clinical symptoms of anhelation (78.6%) and asthma (71.4%). For laboratory examination, 57.1% severe cases showed significant reduction in lymphocyte count. The levels of Interluekin-6 (IL6), IL10, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-Dimer (D-D) were significantly higher in severe patients than mild patients, while the level of albumin (ALB) was remarkably lower in severe patients. Further analysis demonstrated that ESR, D-D, age, ALB and IL6 were the major contributing factors for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients. Moreover, ESR was identified as the most powerful factor to predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Age and the levels of ESR, D-D, ALB and IL6 are closely related to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. ESR can be used as a valuable indicator for distinguishing severe COVID-19 patients in early stage, so as to increase the survival of severe patients.

The onset of disease and its transmission and severity has become a global concern. The policymakers have a serious concern for containing the spread and minimising the risk of death. Aim: This study aims to provide the estimates of basic reproduction rate (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) which applies to a generalised population. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to retrieve the published estimates of reproduction rate and case fatality rate in peer-reviewed articles from PubMed MEDLINE database with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the period 15 December 2019 to 3 May 2020. The systematic review led to the selection of 24 articles for R0 and 17 articles for CFR. These studies used data from China and its provinces, other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and countries from other parts of the world such as Nigeria, Iran, Italy, Europe as a whole, France, Latin America, Turkey, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA). These selected articles gave an output of 30 counts of R0 and 29 counts of CFR which were used in a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis, with the inverse variance method, fixed- and random-effects model and the Forest plot, was performed to estimate the mean effect size or mean value of basic reproduction rate and case fatality rate. The Funnel plot is used to comprehend the publication bias. Results: We estimated the robust estimate of R0 at 3.11 (2.49-3.71) persons and the robust estimate of CFR at 2.56 (2.06-3.05) per cent after accounting for heterogeneity among studies, using the random-effects model. The regional subgroup analysis in a meta-analysis was significant for R0 but was not significant for CFR. The R0 values varied from 1.90 (1.06-2.74) persons to 3.83 (2.44-5.22) persons across the regions. The Funnel plot confirms that the selected studies are significant at one per cent level of significance. Conclusion: We found that one person is likely to infect two to three persons in the absence of any control measures, and around three per cent of the population are at the risk of death within one-and-a-half months from the onset of disease COVID-19 in a generalised population. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 varies across regions, but the risk of death remains the same. Contribution: The estimates of R0 and CFR are independent of data from a particular region or time or a homogeneous population. These estimates are applicable to a generalised population. Therefore, the estimates of R0 and CFR are unequivocally applicable to developing country like India and its states or districts, in ambivalence. The assessments of R0 and CFR values across the developed nations make all of us aware of consequences of COVID-19, and hence these estimates are of crucial importance for government authorities for the practical implementation of strategies and control measures to contain the disease.

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Min; Wu, Jie; Ma, Wenjun; He, Jianfeng; Lu, Jing; Liu, Tao; Li, Baisheng; Mei, Shujiang; Ruan, Feng; Lin, Lifeng; Zou, Lirong; Ke, Changwen; Zhong, Haojie; Zhang, Yingtao; Chen, Xuguang; Liu, Zhe; Zhu, Qi; Xiao, Jianpeng; Yu, Jianxiang; Hu, Jianxiong; Zeng, Weilin; Li, Xing; Liao, Yuhuang; Tang, Xiujuan; Xiao, Songjian; Wang, Ying; Song, Yingchao; Zhuang, Xue; Liang, Lijun; Zeng, Siqing; He, Guanhao; Lin, Peng; Deng, Huihong; Song, Tie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["family cluster infections","community cluster events","evident human","characteristics of human","nosocomial infections","Guangdong Province","human transmissions of SARS","familial cluster events","human transmission risks","demographic data of confirmed cases","SARS-CoV","confirmed COVID","secondary cases","China","genetic sequencing","positive of SARS","suspected case","field investigations","Wuhan","nasal swabs","throat swabs","nosocomial event","outbreak of COVID","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay","endotracheal aspirates","RT-PCR","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","BALF","SNVs","unique single nucleotide variants","epidemic continuing","evidence","travel history","humans","total","medical records","genomes","Exposure","interview","Results","Conclusions","Methods","provinces","findings","Background"],"language":"en"},

Objective: Project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute \u003E90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington. Results: Forecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)- over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study- will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China, where the epidemic curve is complete, and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent. Conclusion and Relevance: Mortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Patrick; Jha, Prabhat","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cf64b5c2f632b07cec8ae5fc42eb2e1f7e82d07.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069161v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","GCAM"],"locations":["Iran","Belgium","China","Netherlands","Switzerland","New York","Louisiana","Washington","Germany"],"keyphrases":["Assessment of Mortality","mortality trends","Mortality trajectories","Mortality ranges","global COVID","actual COVID","Project COVID","undercounts of COVID","Forecasted deaths","Chinese deaths","duration of excess mortality","Reliable estimates of COVID","highest cumulative median mortality rate","trajectory of US deaths","date of peak deaths","past country-specific mortality","California","GCAM","Germany","precise estimates","New York","US states","New Jersey","France","Italy","Spain","UK","Hubei","regions","Results","current high-burden countries","existing capacity","testing strategies","province of China","eventual total","Washington State","aid control strategies","surge capacity needs","guide","Michigan","Belgium","Iran","Louisiana","USA","greatest impact","study","epidemic curve","Canada","age","Netherlands","Participants","Bayesian inference","physical distancing","number of places","settings","Switzerland","population","statistical model","pandemic progresses","Importance","Conclusion","Relevance","Objective","best case scenario","effectiveness of interventions","Design","half","analyses","fold"],"language":"en"},

The diversity, distribution, and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild. Importance Bat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their potential to cause spillover infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bacus, Michael G.; Dayap, Stephen Adrian H.; Tampon, Nikki Vanesa T.; Udarbe, Marielle M.; Puentespina, Roberto P.; Villanueva, Sharon Yvette Angelina M.; de Cadiz, Aleyla E.; Achondo, Marion John Michael M.; Murao, Lyre Anni E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/489b6be9ca9d4829432fe59dc8a4a238255e4298.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.076281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat distribution","bat habitats","bat family","bat taxa","bat dispersal","bat families","host associations of bat CoVs","natural state of bat BetaCoVs","host evolution","host types","Importance Bat Betacoronaviruses","host taxon-specificity","loss of host specificity","divergent African bat hosts","complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity","zoonotic transmission","cross-taxon transmission","viral transmission","random transmission","diverse groups of BetaCoVs","multi-CoV infection","natural barrier","multi-CoV variants","genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs","geographic range","limit wildlife-livestock","enhanced wildlife-livestock","destruction of wildlife habitats","human interfaces","significant global attention","shared CoV lineages","specific BetaCoV group","potential","strong overlap","ecological balance","spillover infections","ecological mechanisms","ecological imbalances","Global surveillance","divergent pathway of BetaCoV","global public health","significant threat","unrelated hosts","related bats","strong role","classification of betacoronaviruses","novel group","D-IV","zoonotic events","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recent pandemic","principal coordinate analysis","past decade","subfamily Pteropodinae","network","division","Emerging infectious diseases","continued disturbances","humans","epidemics","subgroups","original source","initiatives","speciation","fact","deviant patterns"],"language":"en"},

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ruiyun; Pei, Sen; Chen, Bin; Song, Yimeng; Zhang, Tao; Yang, Wan; Shaman, Jeffrey","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eda8331214ca028350b07e2953702f3078a105e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["fraction of undocumented infections","mild infections","spread of documented infection","contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus","source of infection","virus transmission","overall force of infection","observations of reported infection","rapid geographic spread of COVID","majority of COVID","implementation of control measures","travel restrictions","earlier findings","estimate","Wuhan travel shutdown","thirds of documented cases","increased use of personal protective measures","emerging coronavirus","overall prevalence","stealth transmission","reproductive number","critical epidemiological characteristics","Bayesian inference","networked dynamic metapopulation model","mobility data","outbreak","conjunction","China","reductions","heightened awareness","pandemic potential","disease","Background Estimation","Methods","Conclusions","containment","CI"],"language":"en"},

That said, SARS-CoV-2 infects children across all age groups, and despite the high proportion of mild or asymptomatic infections, it would be naive not to consider them as transmitters. To address this point we used cell culture to systematically assess the presence of cultivable SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract in a cohort of our institution first 23 symptomatic neonates, children and teenagers with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR (See Appendix). Median age was 12.0 years (interquartile range [IQR 3.8-14.5], range 7 days-15.9 yrs). Most patients had an upper respiratory tract infection (n=13), followed by fever without source and pneumonia (each, n=2). Samples were collected at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after symptom onset. Median viral load (VL) at time of diagnosis was 3.0x106 copies/ml (mean 4,4x108, IQR 6.9x103-4.4x108) from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation was successful in 12/23 (52%) children after inoculating VeroE6 cells with a NPS specimen. SARS-CoV-2 isolation was determined by the presence of a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) and increased viral RNA in the supernatant. SARS-CoV-2 replication in all positive isolates (12/12) was confirmed by a second passage using new VeroE6 cells. Virus isolation was successful from NPS from all age groups, with a median initial VL of 1.7x108 copies/ml (mean 7.9x108, IQR 4.7x106-1.0x109) (Figure 1). The youngest patient that SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from was a 7-day old neonate. No correlation between disease presentation and success of virus isolation was observed. Our data show that initial VLs at diagnosis in symptomatic children is comparable to those in adults, and that symptomatic children of all ages shed infectious virus in early acute illness. Infectious virus isolation success was largely comparable to that of adults, although two specimens yielded an isolate at a lower VL (1.2x104 and 1.4x105 copies/ml) than what was observed in adults. SARS-CoV-2 shedding patterns of culture competent virus in symptomatic children resemble those observed in adults. Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children at this time, biological or other unknown factors could reduce transmission in this population. Both large serological investigations and systematic surveillance of acute respiratory diseases are needed to understand the role of children in this new pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u0027Huillier, A.

Yet, long turnaround times result from using massively parallel high-throughput technologies as the analysis can only be performed after sequencing has finished. The interpretation of results can further be challenged by contaminations, clinically irrelevant sequences, and the sheer amount and complexity of the data. Results We implemented PathoLive, a real-time diagnostics pipeline for the detection of pathogens from clinical samples hours before sequencing has finished. Based on real-time alignment with HiL-ive2, mappings are scored with respect to common contaminations, low-entropy areas, and sequences of widespread, non-pathogenic organisms. The results are visualized using an interactive taxonomic tree that provides an easily interpretable overview of the relevance of hits. For a human plasma sample that was spiked in vitro with six pathogenic viruses, all agents were clearly detected after only 40 of 200 sequencing cycles. For a real-world sample from Sudan the results correctly indicated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic Fever Virus. In a second real-world dataset from the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, we found the presence of a SARS Coronavirus as the most relevant hit without the novel virus reference genome being included in the database. For all samples, clinically irrelevant hits were correctly de-emphasized.

Results: The recommendations will promote the adoption of action and protection measures for eye care in outpatient clinics, surgical areas and hospitalization, for unconfirmed (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Measures must be adapted to the circumstances and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in each of the centers and Autonomous Communities, which will be updated according to the pandemic phases and the measures adopted by the Spanish Government. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, attention to the potential health risks to the population caused by coronavirus should prevail over the possible progression of the common eye diseases.

We use a simple yet effective mathematical model SIR(D) to predict the future of the epidemic in India by using the existing data. We also estimate the effect of lock-down/social isolation via a time-dependent coefficient of the model. The model study with realistic parameters set shows that the epidemic will be at its peak around the end of June or the first week of July with almost 108 Indians most likely being infected if the lock-down relaxed after May 3, 2020. However, the total number of infected population will become one-third of what predicted here if we consider that people only in the red zones (approximately one-third of India\u0027s population) are susceptible to the infection.

Studies were performed on mice expressing a light sensitive cation channel exclusively on cholinergic neurons (ChAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP). Discrete photostimulations under isoflurane-induced anesthesia from an optical probe positioned above the medullary surface and hypoglossal motor nucleus elicited discrete increases in tongue motor output, with the magnitude of responses dependent on stimulation power (P \u003C 0.001, n = 7) and frequency (P = 0.002, n = 8, with responses to 10 Hz stimulation greater than for 15-25 Hz, P \u003C 0.022). Stimulations during REM sleep elicited significantly reduced responses at powers 3-20 mW compared to non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and wakefulness (each P \u003C 0.05, n = 7). Response thresholds were also greater in REM sleep (10 mW) compared to non-REM and waking (3 to 5 mW, P \u003C 0.05), and the slopes of the regressions between input photostimulation powers and output motor responses were specifically reduced in REM sleep (P \u003C 0.001).

These functional properties of MSCs make them ideal candidates for the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a heterogenous disease that is typically characterized by inflammation, demyelination, gliosis and axonal loss. In the current study, an induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS was utilized. At peak disease onset, animals were treated with saline, placenta-derived MSCs (PMSCs), as well as low and high doses of PMSC-EVs. Animals treated with PMSCs and high-dose PMSC-EVs displayed improved motor function outcomes as compared to animals treated with saline. Symptom improvement by PMSCs and PMSC-EVs led to reduced DNA damage in oligodendroglia populations and increased myelination within the spinal cord of treated mice. In vitro data demonstrate that PMSC-EVs promote myelin regeneration by inducing endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings support that PMSCs\u0027 mechanism of action is mediated by the secretion of EVs. Therefore, PMSC-derived EVs are a feasible alternative to cellular based therapies for MS, as demonstrated in an animal model of the disease.","publish_time":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clark, Kaitlin; Zhang, Sheng; Barthe, Sylvain; Kumar, Priyadarsini; Pivetti, Christopher; Kreutzberg, Nicole; Reed, Camille; Wang, Yan; Paxton, Zachary; Farmer, Diana; Guo, Fuzheng; Wang, Aijun","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8121497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771176/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PMSC-derived EVs","secretion of EVs","PMSCs","high-dose PMSC-EVs","animals","high doses of PMSC","murine model of MS","placenta-derived MSCs","saline","heterogenous disease","spinal cord of treated mice","functional properties of MSCs","peak disease onset","stromal cells","animal model","secretion of bioactive factors","endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells","induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","increased myelination","EAE","feasible alternative","oligodendroglia populations","reduced DNA damage","myelin regeneration","regenerative capabilities","improved motor function outcomes","treatment of degenerative","inflammatory diseases","ideal candidates","cellular based therapies","current study","multiple sclerosis","demyelination","gliosis","proteins","mature myelinating oligodendrocytes","inflammation","Mesenchymal stem","axonal loss","Symptom improvement","release of extracellular vesicles","chemokines","cytokines","mechanism of action","findings","data"],"language":"en"},

Immunologic mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SMPP. Therefore, the use of systemic glucocorticoids may have beneficial effects. However, to date, the use of glucocorticoid therapy in SMPP is limited to small case series, and the glucocorticoid dosage for children with SMPP has not been established. METHODS Here, we used a meta-analysis method to collect data from randomized control trials of different doses of methylprednisolone in SMPP to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with low- versus high-dose methylprednisolone in children with SMPP. RESULTS We included 13 Chinese randomized control trials that included 1049 children. The high- and low-dose groups were comprised of 524 and 525 children, respectively. The high-dose group was significantly more effective than the low-dose group in clinical efficacy [risk ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.23, 1.38), P \u003C 0.05]. In addition, compared with low-dose methylprednisolone, high-dose methylprednisolone significantly shortened hospital stays and antipyretic therapy, pulmonary rales disappearance, cough disappearance and pulmonary shadow absorption times. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the high- and low-dose groups: risk ratio= 0.85, 95% CI (0.53, 1.36), P \u003E 0.05. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective in the treatment of SMPP without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Lin-Li; Ye, Chao; Zhou, Yu-Lu; Zuo, Shan-Ru; Deng, Zhen-Zhen; Wang, Chun-Jiang","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SMPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-dose methylprednisolone","low-dose methylprednisolone","high-dose group","low-dose groups","treatment of SMPP","pathogenesis of SMPP","children","randomized control trials of different doses of methylprednisolone","risk ratio","use of glucocorticoid therapy","efficacy of treatment","Chinese randomized control trials","severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","BACKGROUND Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","pulmonary rales disappearance","cough disappearance","antipyretic therapy","clinical efficacy","glucocorticoid dosage","adverse events","use of systemic glucocorticoids","incidence of adverse reactions","pulmonary shadow absorption times","data","hospital","small case series","safety","meta-analysis method","confidence interval","beneficial effects","significant difference","important role","self-limiting disease","date","addition","CONCLUSIONS","Immunologic mechanisms","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. RESULTS From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period). Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe. There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19. Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully. After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals. Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qifeng; Cheng, Shile; Cheng, Qingzhou","journal":"Panminerva medica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.03908-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["designated community hospital","treatment of COVID","new community-designated hospital","mild COVID","spread of COVID","treatment of medical staff","emergency capacity of community hospitals","treatment model","medical responsibilities","medical burden of superior hospitals","treatment process","general patients","module hospitals","period","pandemic","area management","patient management","efficiency of diagnosis","administration model","excellent results","ward layout","surrounding environment","control stratagems","therapy of suspected","critical task","prevention","isolation","METHODS","admission","experience","concepts","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECT","end","beginning","adjustment","infection"],"language":"en"},

Methods- Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched until March 14, 2019 to identify relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the risk of incident stroke based on hs-cTn were eligible. Pooled adjusted hazard ratios including 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model due to study heterogeneity per population, coding of hs-cTn (categorical/continuous data), per hs-cTn subunit (T or I), for low risk of bias, and for all-cause and ischemic stroke separately. Results- We included 17 articles with 96 702 participants. In studies conducted in the general population (n=12; 77 780 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.25 (CI, 1.10-1.40) for high versus low hs-cTn (as defined by included studies) during an average follow-up of 1 to 20 years (median 10). When categorical data were used, this was increased to 1.58 (CI, 1.26-1.90). The results were robust when accounting for stroke classification (all-cause stroke/ischemic stroke), hs-cTn subunit, risk of bias, and coding of hs-cTn. In patients with atrial fibrillation (4 studies; 18 725 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.95 (CI, 1.29-2.62) for high versus low hs-cTn. Due to lack of data (one study, 197 participants), no meta-analysis could be performed in patients with previous stroke. Conclusions- This meta-analysis suggests that hs-cTn can be regarded as a risk marker for incident stroke, with different effect size in different subgroups. More research about the association between hs-cTn and incident stroke in high-risk populations is needed, especially in patients with history of ischemic stroke.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broersen, Leonie H A; Stengl, Helena; Nolte, Christian H; Westermann, Dirk; Endres, Matthias; Siegerink, Bob; Scheitz, Jan F","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.028323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32078461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of incident stroke","low hs-cTn","previous stroke","hs-cTn subunit","stroke classification","coding of hs","all-cause stroke","history of ischemic stroke","levels of hs","patients","participants","low risk of bias","risk marker","Pooled adjusted hazard ratios","general population","cohort studies","categorical data","atrial fibrillation","study heterogeneity","study aim","meta-analysis","continuous data","lack of data","Results","different subgroups","high-sensitivity cardiac troponin","relevant articles","different effect size","accounting","specific biomarker","myocardial injury","Randomized controlled trials","random-effects model","high-risk populations","PubMed","association","years","Background","Purpose","average follow-up","Methods- Embase","Web of Science","Conclusions","research"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review of all prospective cohort studies on diet quality in preconception or pregnancy and GWG. Our secondary outcomes include gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and birth weight. A comprehensive search of all published articles in MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Food Science and Technology Abstracts (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOHost), from database creation to 20 April 2019, will be conducted. Studies will be screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text in duplicate by two independent reviewers.

We sought to evaluate the association of post-endovascular thrombectomy systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels with clinical outcomes. Methods- We included endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients registered from 2014 to 2017 in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke International Thrombectomy Registry. The mean 24-hour SBP after endovascular thrombectomy treatment was analyzed both as a continuous variable and in intervals. The primary outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). The secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) and 3-month mortality. The SBP interval with the highest proportion of functional independence was chosen as reference. All analyses were performed for successful or unsuccessful recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score \u22652b or \u003C2b, respectively). The results were adjusted for known confounders in logistic regression models. Results- In the multivariable analyses, a higher SBP value as a continuous variable was associated unfavorably with all outcomes in patients with successful recanalization (n=2920) and with more SICH in patients with unsuccessful recanalization (n=711). SBP interval \u2265160 mm Hg was associated with less functional independence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95% CIs, 0.15-0.53]) and more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.82 [95% CIs, 1.53-38.09]) compared with reference 100 to 119 mm Hg in patients with successful recanalization. SBP \u2265160 mm Hg was associated with more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.62 [95% CIs, 1.07-51.05]) compared with reference 120 to 139 mm Hg in patients with unsuccessful recanalization.

We aimed to determine predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and develop utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores in thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke patients from both arms of ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). Methods- ENCHANTED was an international quasi-factorial clinical trial of different doses of intravenous alteplase and intensities of blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke patients, with outcomes on the 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS assessed at 90 days post-randomization. Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline predictors of poor HRQoL (\u2264mean 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale utility scores). Ordinary least squares regression derived utility-weighted mRS scores. Results- In 4016 acute ischemic stroke patients with complete 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS data, independent predictors of poor HRQoL were older age (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27], per 10-year increase), non-Asian ethnicity (1.91 [1.61-2.27]), greater stroke severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (1.11 [1.09-1.12]), diabetes mellitus (1.41 [1.18-1.69]), premorbid disability (mRS score 1 versus 0; 1.62 [1.33-1.97]), large vessel atheromatous pathogenesis (1.32 [1.12-1.54]), and proxy respondent (2.35 [2.01-2.74]). Sensitivity analyses indicate the ethnicity influence on HRQoL was driven by the high proportion of Chinese (62.9% of Asian) participants with better HRQoL compared with non-Chinese or other Asian groups. Derived utility values across mRS scores 0 to 5 were 0.977, 0.885, 0.748, 0.576, 0.194, and -0.174, respectively. Correlations between mRS and 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale scores were stronger in Asians. Conclusions- HRQoL is worse after thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke in the elderly, non-Asians, with greater initial severity, diabetes mellitus, premorbid disability, due to large vessel atheroma, and proxy assessment. The broader significance of better HRQoL in Asians is tempered by Chinese participants dominating analyses. From utility-weighted mRS scores indicating the greatest steps in mRS scores are between 5 and 3, treatments to avoid major disability provide the greatest benefits for patients.

A drive-through prenatal care model was developed in which pregnant women would remain in their automobiles while being assessed by the health care professional, thus reducing potential patient, health care professional, and staff exposure to COVID-19. Drive-through prenatal visits would include key elements that some institutions cannot perform by telehealth encounters, such as blood pressure measurements for evaluation for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal heart rate assessment, and selected ultrasound-based measurements or observations, as well as face-to-face patient-health care professional interaction, thereby reducing patient anxiety resulting from the reduction in the number of planned clinic visits with an obstetric health care professional as well as fear of virus exposure in the clinic setting.

METHODS A single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Associations between the EQ-5D-5L utility value and serious adverse events were assessed using adjusted (age and sex) odds ratios obtained with a proportional odds logistic regression model. RESULTS Data from 1008 patients who received 4695 chemotherapy cycles were analyzed. According to proportional odds logistic regression, the adverse events that significantly correlated with a decreased EQ-5D-5L utility value were malaise, edema of the limbs, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, and dry skin. Based on the proportional odds logistic analysis, neither cancer type nor anticancer drugs were significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L utility value in patients who received chemotherapy. Pharmaceutical care for peripheral neuropathy significantly improved patients\u0027 EQ-5D-5L utility value from 0.747 to 0.776 (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Adverse events (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, malaise, and edema of the limbs) are significantly correlated with a decrease in QOL, regardless of the type of cancer or anticancer drugs used. Pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians may improve QOL.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirose, Chiemi; Fujii, Hironori; Iihara, Hirotoshi; Ishihara, Masashi; Nawa-Nishigaki, Minako; Kato-Hayashi, Hiroko; Ohata, Koichi; Sekiya, Kumiko; Kitahora, Mika; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Takahashi, Takao; Okuda, Kumiko; Naruse, Masayo; Ishihara, Takuma; Sugiyama, Tadashi; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Akio","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05443-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gifu University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of adverse events","CONCLUSIONS Adverse events","occurrence of serious adverse events","outpatient chemotherapy","utility values of QOL","type of cancer","cancer type","chemotherapy regimen","BACKGROUND Outpatient cancer chemotherapy","chemotherapy cycles","peripheral neuropathy","decreased EQ","proportional odds logistic analysis","improved patients\u0027 EQ","proportional odds logistic regression model","odds ratios","edema","malaise","social lives of patients","Pharmaceutical care","limbs","anticancer drugs","Japanese version","Gifu University Hospital","improved quality of life","single-center retrospective descriptive study","EuroQol","Dimension","pruritus","collaboration","age","Common Terminology Criteria","METHODS","pharmacists","sex","Level","decline","dry skin","hospitalization","patient demographics","treatment","physicians","relationship","RESULTS Data","Associations"],"language":"en"},

Dietary habits changed rapidly in the last decades and few data are available on recent dietary changes in children and adolescents with T1D. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that diet composition changed in a 10-year period in children and adolescents with T1D. METHODS 229 T1D subjects (M/F:121/108) aged 6-16 years were recruited: 114 (group A) enrolled in 2009, not using CGM and/or CSII, and 115 (group B) enrolled in 2019. Anthropometric, biochemical (HbA1c, lipid profile), diet and insulin therapy parameters were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with HbA1c as dependent variable (HbA1c \u003E 58 mmol/mol = 1) and nutritional variables and technology use as independent ones. RESULTS Energy intake of group A was not statistically different from that of group B. Group B had a significantly (p \u003C 0.001) higher protein and lipids intake and lower total carbohydrate and fiber intake than group A. HbA1c was significantly (p \u003C 0.01) lower in group B than in group A. Logistic regression analysis showed that MUFA (OR 0.83,95%CI:0.693-0.998), fiber intake (OR 0.82,95%CI:0.699-0.0969), and technology use (OR 0.15,95%CI:0.031-0.685), adjusted for age, gender, BMI, energy intake and diabetes duration, were were associated with a HbA1c higher than 58 mmol/mol) (R2 = 0.27, p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a 10-year period, diet composition of children and adolescents with T1D changed and glucometabolic control improved. Fiber and MUFA intake showed a positive effect on HbA1c, independent from technology use, supporting the importance of educating children with T1D and families to maintain healthy eating habits.

Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals\u0027 brains. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients. All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

However, the role of acute respiratory infections caused by respiratory viruses (RV) has not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcome of acute respiratory infections in children with FN. METHODS Patients, \u003C18 years of age admitted to the Pediatric Oncology-Hematology Unit after developing FN between November 2010 and December 2013, were prospectively included in the study. Children were evaluated by clinical examination and laboratory tests. Nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for detection of RV. RESULTS There was a total of 112 episodes of FN in 73 children admitted to the hospital during a 32-month period. According to disease severity, 33% of the episodes were considered moderate or severe. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected RV (66.6%; 24/36), followed by parainfluenza. On regard to clinical outcome, RV-infected children developed fewer episodes of moderate or severe FN compared with non-RV infected children (16.7% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS A great proportion of children with FN admitted to a tertiary hospital had a RV isolation. The rate of this RV isolation was significantly higher when a rapid molecular test was used compared with conventional microbiological methods.

Our lab has recently linked the chronic inflammation in diabetes to poor functional outcomes and exacerbated cognitive impairment, also known as post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Although we have shown that the development of PSCI in diabetes is associated with the upregulation and the activation of pro-inflammatory microglia, we have not established direct causation between the two. To this end, we evaluated the role of microglia in the development of PSCI. METHODS At 13 weeks of age, diabetic animals received bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). After 14 days, animals were subjected to 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Adhesive removal task (ART), novel object recognition (NOR), and 2-trial Y-maze were utilized to evaluate sensorimotor and cognitive function. Tissue from freshly harvested brains was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS CSF1R silencing resulted in a 94% knockdown of residential microglia to relieve inflammation and improve myelination of white matter in the brain. This prevented cognitive decline in diabetic animals. CONCLUSION Microglial activation after stroke in diabetes may be causally related to the development of delayed neurodegeneration and PSCI.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Ladonya; Dumanli, Selin; Johnson, Maribeth H; Fagan, Susan C; Ergul, Adviye","journal":"Journal of neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-01815-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345303/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of PSCI","post-stroke cognitive impairment","severity of cognitive impairment","cognitive decline","cognitive function","diabetic animals","pre-existing diabetes","stroke victims","risk of stroke","role of microglia","activation of pro-inflammatory microglia","knockdown of residential microglia","development of delayed neurodegeneration","chronic inflammation","functional recovery","poor functional outcomes","CONCLUSION Microglial activation","RESULTS CSF1R silencing","ICV","shRNA","injections of short hairpin RNA","lentiviral particles","bilateral intracerebroventricular","MCAO","colony","middle cerebral artery occlusion","factor","weeks of age","myelination of white matter","harvested brains","flow cytometry","Adhesive removal task","novel object recognition","upregulation","sham surgery","receptor","trial Y-maze","Tissue","immunohistochemistry","METHODS","lab","fold","direct causation","end","days","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES To present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. METHODS A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. RESULTS Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Negrini, Stefano; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella","journal":"European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.20.06378-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PEDro"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Covid","rehabilitation community","effects of rehabilitation","rehabilitation services","rehabilitation strategies","systematic search","early respiratory rehabilitation","descriptive studies","experimental studies","systematic scientific literature search","disabled patients","rapid guidelines","series of systematic rapid living reviews","prospective cohort studies","case series","overall quality of studies","articles","pandemic","complications of rehabilitative","results","papers","latest scientific literature","post-acute phase","scoping review","disability course","case report","emerging disability","main novelties","qualitative analysis","diseases of rehabilitative","main international guideline databases","likely high incidence of neurological complications","Web of Science","randomized controlled trial","CINAHL","increasing evidence","Scopus","PEDro","Embase","PubMed","telemonitoring","telerehabilitation","features","updates","information","sequelae","appearance of epidemiological data","prevalence","stage","management","CONCLUSIONS","Epub","expert opinions","setting","impact","advices","following","time frame","BACKGROUND","METHODS","English","OBJECTIVES","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Here, we utilize PPFPA grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates are prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ku, Jayoung; Kim, Sura; Park, Jaemin; Kim, Tae-Shin; Kharbash, Raisa; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Char, Kookheon; Kim, Yoosik; Li, Sheng","journal":"Biomacromolecules","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed PPFPA platform","cellular dsRNAs","captured dsRNAs","short dsRNAs","developed platform","single platform","foreign long dsRNAs","J2 antibody","versatile platform","PPFPA grafted surface","prepared surfaces","C viruses","dsRNA antibody immobilization","dsRNA detection sensitivity","universal virus detection platform","J2 antibodies","wide range of viruses","presence of different kinds of viruses","single-stranded RNAs","pentafluorophenyl units","pentafluorophenyl acrylate","surface hydrophilicity","enhanced sensitivity","biomolecules present","Reactive poly","double-stranded RNA","common byproducts of viral transcription","infection status","prior knowledge","partial substitution","two-step method","replication","multiple fluorophore","primary diagnostic tool","ethylene glycol","length","genomic sequences","silicon substrates","cell lysate","hepatitis","study","cells"],"language":"en"},

Different drugs for prophylaxis against COVID-19 including chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been tried. This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID-19. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 (pre-clinical studies) or COVID-19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised. RESULTS A total of 45 articles were screened and five (three in vitro pre-clinical studies and two clinical opinions) were included. The pre-clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID-19 were available. CONCLUSION Although pre-clinical results are promising, till date, there is dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID-19. Considering potential safety issues and the likelihood of imparting a false sense of security, prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated in observational studies or high quality randomized controlled studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Sanket; Das, Saibal; Jain, Avinash; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Negi, Vir Singh","journal":"International journal of rheumatic diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.13842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov","HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ","pre-clinical studies","original clinical studies","prophylactic role of CQ","clinical opinions","pre-clinical results","observational studies","efficacy of CQ","spread of COVID","prophylactic effects of CQ","prophylactic use of CQ","high quality randomized controlled studies","prophylaxis","SARS-CoV","available literature","crisis","likelihood","ICTRP","false sense of security","pandemic Coronavirus Disease","Cochrane Library databases","date","dearth of evidence","EMBASE","global healthcare system","potential safety issues","OBJECTIVE","Different drugs","needs","hydroxychloroquine","CONCLUSION","huge economic burden","METHODS PubMed","hand","total","articles","study"],"language":"en"},

This kind of malnutrition can have several immediate and long-term consequences, including stunted growth, a higher risk of acquiring infections, and poor development outcomes, all of which may lead to a child not achieving his or her full potential. This review systematically synthesizes the available evidence on the strategies used to prevent micronutrient malnutrition among children under-five in LMICs, including single and multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation, lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS), targeted and large-scale fortification, and point-of-use-fortification with micronutrient powders (MNPs). We searched relevant databases and grey literature, retrieving 35,924 papers. After application of eligibility criteria, we included 197 unique studies. Of note, we examined the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. We found that certain outcomes, such as anemia, responded to several intervention types. The risk of anemia was reduced with iron alone, iron-folic acid, MMN supplementation, MNPs, targeted fortification, and large-scale fortification. Stunting and underweight, however, were improved only among children who were provided with LNS, though MMN supplementation also slightly increased length-for-age z-scores. Vitamin A supplementation likely reduced all-cause mortality, while zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of diarrhea. Importantly, many effects of LNS and MNPs held when pooling data from effectiveness studies. Taken together, this evidence further supports the importance of these strategies for reducing the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in children. Population and context should be considered when selecting one or more appropriate interventions for programming.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tam, Emily; Keats, Emily C; Rind, Fahad; Das, Jai K; Bhutta, And Zulfiqar A","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LNS","MMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MMN supplementation","zinc supplementation","nutrient supplementation","MNPs","multiple micronutrient","micronutrient powders","children under-five","Micronutrient deficiencies","burden of micronutrient malnutrition","large-scale fortification","targeted fortification","use-fortification","LMICs","risk of anemia","kind of malnutrition","effects of LNS","effective strategies","effectiveness of interventions","effectiveness studies","certain outcomes","unique studies","available evidence","appropriate interventions","iron-folic acid","poor development outcomes","higher risk of acquiring infections","stunted growth","lipid","all-cause mortality","increased length","long-term consequences","middle-income countries","grey literature","point","age z-scores","relevant databases","application of eligibility criteria","efficacy","incidence of diarrhea","Vitamin","fact","papers","programming","intervention types","review","importance","Population","context","note","potential"],"language":"en"},

In England, 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed via urgent symptomatic referral from primary care, the \u00222-week-wait\u0022 (2WW) pathway. Access to routine endoscopy is likely to be a critical bottleneck causing delays in CRC management due to chronic limitation in capacity, acute competition for physician time, and safety concerns. Methods: We used age-specific, stage-specific 10 year CRC survival for England 2007-2017 and 2WW CRC cases volumes. We used per-day hazard ratios of CRC survival generated from observational studies of CRC diagnosis-to-treatment interval to model the effect of different durations of per-patient delay. We utilised data from a large London observational study of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in symptomatic patients to model FIT-triage to mitigate delay to colonoscopy. Findings: Modest delays result in significant reduction in survival from CRC with a 4-month delay resulting across age groups in [\u2265]20% reduction in survival in Stage 3 disease and in total over a year, 1,419 attributable deaths across the 11,266 CRC patients diagnosed via the 2WW pathway. FIT triage of \u003E10 ug Hb/g would salvage 1,292/1,419 of the attributable deaths and reduce colonoscopy requirements by \u003E80%. Diagnostic colonoscopy offers net survival in all age groups, providing nosocomial COVID-19 infection rates are kept low (\u003C2.5%). Interpretation To avoid significant numbers of avoidable deaths from CRC, normal diagnostic and surgical throughput must be maintained. An accrued backlog of cases will present to primary care following release of lockdown, supranormal endoscopy capacity will be required to manage this without undue delays. FIT-triage of symptomatic cases provides a rational approach by which to avoid patient delay and mitigate pressure on capacity in endoscopy. This would also reduce exposure to nosocomial COVID-19 infection, relevant in particular to older patient groups.

METHODS From 23 to 28 April 2020, we conducted serological testing for antibodies (IgG and IgM) on 1494 factory employees living in the Split-Dalmatia and Sibenik-Knin County (Croatia). We analysed antibody seroprevalence on the level of the company, county, and separately for employees living at the factory premises with limited mobility during the lockdown measures. RESULTS In a total sample of tested company employees, we detected antibodies in 1.27% of participants (95% CI 0.77-1.98%). In Split facility 13/1316 (0.99%, 95% CI 0.53-1.68%) of participants were tested positive, of which 13/1079 (1.20%, 95% CI 0.64-2.05%) of those living outside the facility and 0/237 (0%, 95% CI 0-1.26%) of those living inside the facility.

They also examined whether findings differed between later versus earlier responders. Methods Between March 10 and 31, 2020, investigators conducted a cross-sectional online survey with a nationally representative U.S. sample (N=6,684). Half responded before March 13, 2020 (versus later). Participants assessed their risks of COVID-19 infection and infection fatality (0%\u2013100%), and were transformed into quartiles (1\u20134). They reported their implementation of protective behaviors like handwashing and social distancing (yes/no). Analyses were conducted in April\u2012May 2020. Results Median perceived risk was 10.00% for COVID-19 infection and 5.00% for infection fatality, but respondents showed large disagreement. An increase of one quartile in perceived infection risk was associated with being 1.45 (95% CI=1.33, 1.58) more likely to report handwashing, with perceived infection fatality risk showing no significant association. When predicting social distancing behaviors such as avoiding crowds, both quartile-based risk perceptions were significant (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.17, 1.30 for infection and OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.13, 1.26 for infection fatality). Perceived COVID-19 infection risk, protective behaviors, and their relationship increased among later (versus earlier) responders. Conclusions Despite disagreements about the risks, people perceiving greater risks were more likely to implement protective behaviors\u2014especially later (versus earlier) in March 2020. These findings have implications for risk communication.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Bruin, W\u00E4ndi Bruine; Bennett, Daniel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58efdc6574fe1923c9111e5377aa5bdbcab83f23.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379720302130; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379720302130?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["perceived infection risk","perceived infection fatality risk","perceived risks","risks of COVID","Perceived COVID","Median perceived risk","risk communication","unfamiliar risk","implementation of protective behaviors","quartile-based risk perceptions","social distancing behaviors","greater risks","Introduction Perceptions of health risks","earlier responders","handwashing","findings","significant association","decisions","authors","crowds","epidemic","people","cross-sectional online survey","coronavirus disease","respondents","large disagreement","sample","investigators","initial stage","disagreements","implications","relationship","increase","Conclusions","Participants","Methods","Half","quartiles","Analyses"],"language":"en"},

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz, normal, other_disease, pneumonia and Covid-19. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 95.3%{\u002B/-}0.02. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification.

We developed a strategy for overcoming this bias to obtain more plausible estimates of the true values of key epidemiological variables. We fit mechanistic Bayesian latent-variable SIR models to confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, for all regions (countries and US states) independently. Bayesian averaging over models, we find that the raw infection incidence rate underestimates the true rate by a factor, the case ascertainment ratio CARt that depends upon region, and show how CARt changes over time. At the regional onset of COVID-19, the predicted global median for each case confirmed was 13 infections unreported (CARt = 0.07 C.I. (0.02, 0.4)). As the infection spread, the median CARt rose to 9 unreported cases for every one diagnosed as of April 15, 2020 (CARt = 0.1 C.I. (0.02, 0.5)). We also estimate that the median global initial reproduction number R0 is 3.3 (C.I (1.5, 8.3)) and the total infection fatality rate near the onset is 0.17% (C.I. (0.05%, 0.9%)). However the time-dependent reproduction number Rt and infection fatality rate as of April 15 were 1.2 (C.I. (0.6, 2.5)) and 0.8% (C.I. (0.2%,4%)), respectively. We find that there is great variability between country- and state-level values. Our estimates are consistent with recent serological estimates of cumulative infections for the state of New York, but inconsistent with claims that very large fractions of the population have already been infected in most other regions.

The pattern of outbreaks for COVID-19 across the globe have differed markedly above and below \u002B40N latitudes, suggesting very different levels of severity, but countries worldwide have implemented the same lockdown strategies. Existing methods for estimating severity appear not to have been useful in informing strategic decisions, possibly due to mismatches between the data required and those available, overly sophisticated methods with undesirable biases, or perhaps confusion and uncertainly generated by the wide range of estimates these methods produced early on. The Epidemic Severity Index (ESI) is a simple, robust method for estimating the local severity of novel epidemic outbreaks using early and widely-available data and that does not depend on any estimated values. ESI allows rapid, meaningful comparisons across territories that can be tracked as the outbreaks unfold. The ESI quantifies severity relative to a parameterised baseline rather than attempting to estimate values for infection fatality rates, case fatality rates or transmission rates. The relative nature of the ESI sidesteps any problems of confidence associated with absolute rate estimation methods and offers immediate practical strategic value.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, Gareth","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6734b0eed791849124f41bc070cd3f67bf12708.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077685v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity relative","estimating severity","Epidemic Severity Index","local severity of novel epidemic outbreaks","different levels of severity","sophisticated methods","Existing methods","available data","case fatality rates","infection fatality rates","transmission rates","early stages","pattern of outbreaks","absolute rate estimation methods","absence of reliable data","novel pathogen","strategic decisions","relative nature","estimated values","immediate practical strategic value","problems of confidence","undesirable biases","robust method","meaningful comparisons","countries","parameterised baseline","territories","confusion","N latitudes","COVID","mismatches","wide range","lockdown strategies","globe"],"language":"en"},

As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, W.; Rao, S.; Xiao, C.; Lin, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Qi, W.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64ebdaed98a2b07b11d2d61772b971979acc876a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.03.20020289v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan City","China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV infection","ACE2 mRNA","cell entry receptor ACE2","small intestinal epithelium cells","single-cell RNA sequencing data","intestinal inflammation","incidence of diarrhea","route of infection","outbreak of pneumonia","Novel Coronavirus","healthy human small intestine","different reports","recent reports","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","people","infected wild animals","distal enterocytes","results of inter-group difference test","clinicians","patients","analysis","clinical symptoms","attention","lung","Wuhan City","indicator","foreign pathogen","China"],"language":"en"},

We report thromboelastography (TEG) testing on a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of admission to the intensive care unit. Methods: TEG testing was performed using the TEG 6s analyzer near or at the time of ICU admission. We also report the results of other coagulation or inflammatory related indices such as platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin. All laboratory testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in the course of normal patient care and retrospectively reviewed. Results: We found that maximum clot strength was consistently elevated in COVID-19 patients while normal in all patients found to be negative. We did not encounter significant prolongations of coagulation assays outside of those expectedly prolonged by heparin therapy nor was meeting the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered. Conclusions: We postulate that elevated maximum clot strength by TEG testing is predictive of COVID-19 status as within our cohort this perfectly predicted patients COVID-19 status despite a high level of suspicion in negative patients with normal TEG results. While these results require a larger cohort for confirmation, we feel that TEG testing could improve confidence in negative COVID-19 testing results in suspected patients possibly allowing for earlier de-escalation of infectious precautions and personal protective equipment utilization.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawicki, S.

This study aims to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 positivity for the first 669 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the population. Methods: We studied 1,474 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19. Given UK testing policy, this implies a hospital setting, suggesting at least moderate to severe symptoms. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between: 1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 tested negative participants; and 2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n=501,837). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and greater BMI were independently associated with COVID-19 positive result. Non-white ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, prior MI, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalisation rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalisation, without specificity for COVID-19.

Quarantine strategies play the key role on the disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. Methods: In this study, a SEIRQ epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and mainland China, from Jan 27, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. Results: The major results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. Conclusions: Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Qianqian; Hu, Zengyun; Li, Yingke; Han, Junmei; Teng, Zhidong; Qian, Jing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c9c294d6d1b1b07b612df2373730b85a64ce347.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120304809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120304809?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["Quarantine strategies","disease control strategies","Coronavirus Disease","disease outbreak","disease patients","disease extinction","quarantine time points","different quarantine magnitudes","early quarantine strategy","cumulative confirmed cases","cumulative recovered cases","cumulative death cases","dynamic changes of COVID","exposed individuals","susceptible individuals","infectious individuals","SEIRQ epidemic model","variations","mainland China","provinces of China","Conclusions","important scientific information","World Health Organization","time delayed quarantining","early period","public health","major results","Wuhan of Hubei province","government policymaker","high accuracy","larger roles","quarantines","key role","study","impacts","days","perspectives","Abstract Background","pandemic","effects","Methods","countries"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction and objectives Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is one of the most common etiological agents of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics, treatment and outcome of children diagnosed with community-acquired MP pneumonia (CAMP) in a tertiary hospital in Valencia, Spain. Material and methods Medical records of children \u003C14 years with CAMP were retrospectively reviewed from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia and microbiological confirmation of MP (PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum specific IgM) were considered CAMP. Results One hundred and sixty two children were diagnosed with CAMP; median age 6 years (IQR: 4-9). The positive MP test rate among children with CAP progressively increased with age as did the empirical use of macrolides. There were two peaks of cases in 2011 and in 2015, being July, August, November and December the seasons with the higher number of cases. The most frequent radiological pattern was segmental infiltrate (62.3%) and 22 (13.6%) children had pleural effusion. It was noteworthy the mild symptomatology and low levels of inflammatory parameters that children with CAMP had. A macrolide was empirically initiated in 68.5% of cases. Hospital admission rate was inversely proportional to patient\u0027s age. Conclusions According to this study, older, less symptomatic patients and with lower inflammatory parameters had the greatest rate of MP infection among children with CAP and thus they could benefit of empiric macrolide therapy. Therefore, knowing the epidemiology of a geographical area may be important for the management of CAP in children.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilera-Alonso, David; L\u00F3pez Ruiz, Roc\u00EDo; Centeno Rubiano, Jose; Morell Garc\u00EDa, Marta; Valero Garc\u00EDa, Isabel; Ocete Moch\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Montesinos Sanchis, Elena","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daaa19974be8ccb2f24ba20f142db04d3188d882.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403318305472; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403318305472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Objetivo"],"organizations":["NAC"],"locations":["Spain","Valencia"],"keyphrases":["y en","MP pneumonia","NAC por MP","NAC en ni\u00F1os","los ni\u00F1os","los pacientes","infecci\u00F3n por MP","macr\u00F3lido en","los casos","outcome of children","CAMP","tratamiento y evoluci\u00F3n","pruebas positivas para MP en pacientes","microbiological confirmation of MP","noviembre y diciembre","casos en julio","exudado nasofar\u00EDngeo y","greatest rate of MP infection","positive MP test rate","neumon\u00EDas adquiridas en","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas y epidemiol\u00F3gicas","se consideraron NACM","siendo poco sintom\u00E1ticos y","neumon\u00EDa y confirmaci\u00F3n microbiol\u00F3gica","Material y m\u00E9todos Se revisaron retrospectivamente","pacientes se diagnosticaron","methods Medical records of children","a\u00F1os","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n y objetivos Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Se inici\u00F3 tratamiento emp\u00EDrico","management of CAP","los agentes etiol\u00F3gicos m\u00E1s comunes","mayor edad tuvieron","NACM entre enero","Hospital admission rate","mayor proporci\u00F3n","PCR","uso emp\u00EDrico","par\u00E1metros inflamatorios","macr\u00F3lidos","Por consiguiente","radiological evidence of pneumonia","tertiary hospital","hospital terciario","median age","years","patient\u0027s age","Valencia","peaks of cases","NACM desarrollaron una cl\u00EDnica leve","lower inflammatory parameters","objectives Mycoplasma pneumoniae","higher number of cases","historias cl\u00EDnicas","escasa elevaci\u00F3n","poca elevaci\u00F3n","low levels of inflammatory parameters","symptomatic patients","pleural effusion","patr\u00F3n radiol\u00F3gico m\u00E1s frecuente fue","serum specific IgM","frequent radiological pattern","presentaron derrame pleural","empiric macrolide therapy","common etiological agents of community","o anticuerpos IgM espec\u00EDficos frente","ingreso hospitalario fue inversamente proporcional","\u00E1rea geogr\u00E1fica podr\u00EDa ser importante para","es uno","abordaje","pudi\u00E9ndose beneficiar","as\u00ED como","epidemiolog\u00EDa","evidencia radiol\u00F3gica","agosto","infiltrado segmentario","nasopharyngeal swab","mediana","m\u00E1ximo","comunidad","mild symptomatology","Conclusiones Seg\u00FAn este estudio","necesidad","conocer","treatment","describir","aument\u00F3 progresivamente","pico","epidemiological characteristics","Abstract Introduction","segmental infiltrate","study","rango intercuart\u00EDlico","geographical area","seasons","Spain","IQR","Espa\u00F1a","Hubo","empirical use of macrolides","mientras que","epidemiology","Conclusions","Resultados","Results"],"language":"en"},

Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Epidemiological studies suggest that bats are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Functional assays showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yinghui; Hu, Gaowei; Wang, Yuyan; Zhao, Xiaomin; Ji, Fansen; Ren, Wenlin; Gong, Mingli; Ju, Xiaohui; Li, Changhe; Hong, Junxian; Zhu, Yuanfei; Cai, Xia; Wu, Jianping; Lan, Xun; Xie, Youhua; Wang, Xinquan; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.046565","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New World"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediate SARS-CoV","host range of SARS","bat ACE2","ferret ACE2","ability of ACE2","ACE2 proteins","structure of SARS","viral entry","virus entry","broad host tropism of SARS","CoV spike protein interaction","mammalian ACE2 orthologs","New World monkey ACE2 orthologs","genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2","broad range of species","host receptor","wide range of species","key genetic determinant of host range","host cells","amino acid residues of ACE2 critical","diverse species","cross-species transmission","interaction of coronavirus","species-dependent manner","palm civet","pig","mammals","study","pandemic of Coronavirus Disease","domestic animals","susceptible hosts","intermediate hosts","functional analyses","Functional assays","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","natural zoonotic reservoir","bats","contrast","pets","livestock","aquaria","angiotensin","high conservation","major global health threat","necessity","future outbreaks","COVID","humans","findings","murine ortholog","zoos","Epidemiological studies","enzyme","summary"],"language":"en"},

In particular, many patients develop profound hyperinflammation and hypercoagulopathy with disseminated thrombogenesis and thromboembolism, which we observe also in a Swedish COVID-19 intensive care patient cohort. To understand these vascular manifestations, it is important to establish the potential vascular entry point(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, i.e. which vascular cell types express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We present data that ACE2 is specifically and highly expressed in microvascular pericytes, but absent from endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages and fibroblasts. Mice with pericyte ablation show increased expression and release of Von Willebrand Factor from microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that pericytes orchestrate thrombogenic responses in neighboring endothelial cells. Identifying pericytes rather than endothelial cells as the ACE2-expressing cells in the vasculature may explain why hypertension, diabetes and obesity are risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients, as these conditions are characterized by an impaired endothelial barrier function, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to reach and infect the pericytes that are normally shielded from the blood behind an intact endothelial barrier.

Human mobility represents a crucial element to be considered in modelling human infectious diseases. In this paper, we examined the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 propagation using a Susceptible-Infected stochastic model (SI) driven mainly by commuting network in Italy. We modelled a municipality-specific contact rate to capture the disease permeability of each municipality, considering the population at different times of the day and describing the characteristic of the municipalities as attractors of commuters or places that make their workforce available elsewhere. The purpose of our analysis is to provide a better understanding of the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Italy and to characterize the territory in terms of vulnerability at local or national level. The use of data at such a high spatial resolution allows highlighting particular situations on which the health authorities can promptly intervene to control the disease spread. Our approach provides decision-makers with useful geographically detailed metrics to evaluate those areas at major risk for infection spreading and for which restrictions of human mobility would give the greatest benefits, not only at the beginning of the epidemic but also in the last phase, when the risks deriving from the gradual lockdown exit strategies must be carefully evaluated.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savini, L.; Candeloro, L.; Calistri, P.; Conte, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eefec925dc1e25ad6a477ff050b7483404a8a04.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20100040v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Italy","restrictions of human mobility","population","beginning","epidemiological context of COVID","modelling human infectious diseases","growing epidemic","disease permeability","disease spread","municipality-specific contact rate","highlighting particular situations","high spatial resolution","Italian Government","places","areas","detailed metrics","place emergency measures","Susceptible-Infected stochastic model","propagation","terms of vulnerability","decision-makers","better understanding","crucial element","infection","attractors of commuters","municipalities","day","movement","territory","major risk","national level","health authorities","different times","greatest benefits","gradual lockdown","risks","analysis","characteristic","approach","use of data","mechanisms","response","Europe","epicentre","workforce available","strategies","phase","network","purpose","paper"],"language":"en"},

Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Method: We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (\u226585%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (\u003C50%) combined with an increased public contact (\u003E100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lei; Shen, Mingwang; Ma, Xiaomeng; Su, Shu; Gong, Wenfeng; Wang, Jing; Tao, Yusha; Zou, Zhuoru; Zhao, Rui; Lau, Joseph; Li, Wei; Liu, Feng; Ye, Kai; Wang, Youfa; Zhuang, Guihua; Fairley, Christopher K","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dcf3293fc3b3a47ac6022049d86023ba5eb5e69.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042374","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["different quarantine","pre-quarantine level","public contacts","low facial mask usage","increased public contact","public person","low public contact rate","lower level of facial mask usage","sustaining high facial mask usage","combinations of public contact rates","person contact","impact of different rates of public contact","household contact","metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city","early lifting date","non-COVID","coronavirus COVID","high rate","total","hospital contacts","trend","dates","Chinese government","key health interventions","epidemics","compartmental dynamic model","effects","prevention","outbreak","related pneumonia","medical staff members","smooth decline","Method","Background","patients","scenarios","individuals","Conclusion","contrast","Results"],"language":"en"},

The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds. There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state\u0027s older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overwhelm the limited number of inpatient and ICU beds for the US population. Hospitals in half of US states would exceed capacity if less than 0.2% of the state population requires hospitalization in any given month.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khera, R.; Jain, S.; Lin, Z.; Ross, J.

Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the human coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2, indicate cytokine involvement. Our laboratory showed that an experimental murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted into the brain by intranasal or intracerebral exposure and that neurovirulence is mediated by cytokine secretion. In this study we investigated which cells in the brain produce cytokines, thus functioning as the brain\u0027s innate immune system. Using tissue cultures of microglia, and clonal populations of astrocytes, we found that microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III), produced pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to MHV-A59 infection. A molecularly closely related, non-encephalitic strain of the virus (MHV-2) caused in vitro infection, but without cytokine induction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that type I astrocytes and microglia have perivascular foot processes necessary for the formation of the perivascular glymphatic system, the anatomical site of the brain\u0027s innate immune system. Cytokine secretion by type I astrocytes and microglia, as part of the brain\u0027s glymphatic and innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of an encephalitic coronavirus infection, and indicates the rationale for anti-cytokine therapies for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavi, Ehud; Cong, Lin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb0552eae459f2a55e0cf1d6de0fac98f11a2185.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014480020304500; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014480020304500?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain\u0027s innate immune system","cytokine secretion","immune response","encephalitic coronavirus infection","cytokine involvement","cytokine induction","type","perivascular glymphatic system","MHV-A59 infection","brain\u0027s glymphatic","tissue cultures of microglia","anti-cytokine therapies","human coronavirus disease COVID","experimental murine coronavirus","clonal populations of astrocytes","novel coronavirus SARS CoV","pro-inflammatory cytokines","pathogenesis of viral infections","laboratory findings","tissue destruction","viral replication","non-encephalitic strain","perivascular foot processes necessary","anatomical site","formation","addition","rationale","organ function","deleterious effect","neurovirulence","intracerebral exposure","Clinical symptoms","cells","immunohistochemistry","immunofluorescence","study"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that this association might extend to the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children enrolled at birth, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in relation to two genetic polymorphisms functionally affecting type III interferons - rs368234815 (IFN-\u03BB4) and rs4803217 (IFN-\u03BB3), using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through 1-5 years of follow-up. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-\u03BB4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.004), malaria (p=0.044) or respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of ever experiencing an infection during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele \u2013 for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.5, 95%CI (1.11-2.03), p=0.0079) and malaria (OR=1.32, 95%CI (1.04-1.68, p=0.022), but not respiratory infections (p=0.58).

All the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-\u03BB4 and not IFN-\u03BB3 as the primary cause of these associations.

Methods: In this study, zip-code level data from 5 major metropolitan areas, was utilized to study the effect of multiple demographic \u0026 socio-economic factors including race, age, income, chronic disease comorbidity, population density, number of people per household on number of positive cases and ensuing death. Adjusted linear regression analysis using 13 to 16 such variables was performed. Results: Overall, 442 zip codes reporting 93,170 positive COVID-19 cases and 138 zip codes reporting mortality ranging from 0 to 25 were included in this study. A multivariable linear regression model noted that 1% increase in the proportion of residents above the age of 65 years, proportion of African American residents, proportion of females, persons per household and population density of the zip code increased the proportion of positive cases by 0.77%, 0.23%, 1.64%, 1.83% and 0.46% respectively (P\u003C0.01) with only population density remaining significant in zip codes with greater than median number of cases. In zips with greater than median number of deaths, no community/socio-economic factor contributed significantly to death. Conclusion: This study gives early signals of gender, and racial inequalities while providing overwhelming evidence of how population density may contribute to an increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guha, Avirup; Bonsu, Janice; Dey, Amit; Addison, Daniel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87bc029dfc1367736094a6cf150eedfbbf335666.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071944v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["proportion of positive cases","number of positive cases of COVID","median number of cases","population density","zip codes","study","number of people","positive COVID","proportion of residents","median number of deaths","proportion of females","zip-code level data","household","age","proportion of African American residents","increase","linear regression analysis","socio-economic factors","involvement of community","Multiple reports","ensuing death","multivariable linear regression model","socioeconomic characteristics of people","effect of multiple demographic","race","income","chronic disease comorbidity","years","persons","racial inequalities","early signals of gender","overwhelming evidence","major metropolitan areas","United States","Conclusion","zips","mortality","Background","Results","Methods","variables"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we report a case of sacrococcygeal hernia occurring in a patient who had no history of sacrococcygeal operation, present the operative procedures of mesh repair via a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach that has not been described, and discuss our experience in diagnosis and treatment with a review of the literature. CASE SUMMARY A 54-year-old woman who chiefly complained of a 10-year history of a reversible bulge in her right sacrococcygeal region was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination revealed a bulge in the right sacrococcygeal region upon standing, which disappeared in the prone position but relapsed when performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. Computed tomography displayed an abnormality in the structure of the tissues between the midline of the sacrococcygeal region and the right gluteus muscle. The patient was diagnosed with sacrococcygeal hernia and received hernia repair with mesh through a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach. On laparoscopy, the rectum was dissected posterolaterally, and a defect was identified in the right anterior sacrococcygeal region through which part of the rectum protruded. This was followed by the placement of a self-gripping polyester mesh via a sacrococcygeal approach. There were no postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 and was followed for more than 6 mo with no recurrence. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic mesh repair is recommended as a priority of surgical options for sacrococcygeal hernias, while choosing a self-gripping mesh can help avoid the risk of presacral vessel injury by reducing suture fixation.","publish_time":"2020-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Yuan-Qiang; Liu, Li-Jia; Fu, Zan; Chen, Si-Meng","journal":"World journal of clinical cases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i2.362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sacrococcygeal approach","right sacrococcygeal region","sacrococcygeal hernias","case of sacrococcygeal hernia","BACKGROUND Sacrococcygeal hernia","right anterior sacrococcygeal region","history of sacrococcygeal operation","hernia repair","self-gripping mesh","CONCLUSION Laparoscopic mesh repair","patient","operative procedures of mesh repair","self-gripping polyester mesh","right gluteus muscle","rectum","reversible bulge","year history","CASE SUMMARY","postoperative day","postoperative complications","ideal treatment regimen","risk of presacral vessel injury","sacrococcygectomy","rare condition","priority of surgical options","abnormality","structure","suture fixation","tissues","placement","midline","standing","diagnosis","review","year-old woman","Computed tomography","physical examination","prone position","experience","literature","defect","hospital","Valsalva manoeuvre","recurrence","laparoscopy"],"language":"en"},

Fecal carriage of drug-resistant bacteria has been suggested as an important source of antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs). We aimed to identify risk factors associated with fecal carriage of drug-resistant commensal Escherichia coli among healthy adult population. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guideline. We identified observational studies published from 2014 to 2019 through PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported risk factors and accompanying measure of associations for fecal carriage of drug-resistant E. coli for healthy population aged 18-65. Data on risk factors assessed in three or more studies were extracted. RESULTS Fifteen of 395 studies involving 11480 healthy individuals were included. The pooled prevalence of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-23%). Antimicrobial use within the 12 months prior to stool culture (odds ratio [OR] 1.84 [95%CI 1.35-2.51]), diarrhea symptoms (OR 1.56 [95%CI 1.09-2.25]), travel to India (OR 4.15 [95%CI 2.54-6.78]), and vegetarian diet (OR 1.60 [95%CI 1.00(1.0043)-2.56(2.5587)]) were associated with increased risk of fecal carriage of drug-resistant E. coli.

Diet-related outcomes included purchasing, dietary intakes, diet quality, and health including weight. We coded studies for enabling public policy levers underpinning the intervention, using two widely used conceptual frameworks. RECENT FINDINGS Of 86 articles (1974-2018), the majority (58 articles, 67%) showed at least one positive effect on diet. Thirteen articles (15%) discussed natural experiments, 27 articles (31%) used a design involving comparison groups including 23 articles (27%) specifically describing randomized controlled trials, and 46 (53%) were quasi-experimental (cross-sectional) evaluations. Across the \u00224Ps\u0022 of marketing (product, promotion, placement, and price), promotion comprised the greatest proportion of intervention strategies, especially in earlier literature (pre-2008). Few studies combined geographic access interventions with 4P strategies, and few used robust dietary intake assessments. Behavior change communication remains an intervention mainstay, but recent work has also incorporated environmental and social planning, and fiscal strategies. More recent interventions were multi-component. The retail food environment intervention literature continues to grow and has become more robust overall, with clearer evidence of the effect of interventions on diet-related outcomes, including consumer purchasing, dietary intakes, and health. There is still much scope for development in the field. Attention to enabling public policy could help to strengthen intervention implementation and evaluation in the retail food environment.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mah, Catherine L; Luongo, Gabriella; Hasdell, Rebecca; Taylor, Nathan G A; Lo, Brian K","journal":"Current nutrition reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-019-00295-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31797233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["articles","recent interventions","retail food environment intervention literature","effectiveness of retail food environment interventions","effect of interventions","level interventions","intervention mainstay","intervention implementation","Diet-related outcomes","diet quality","health","dietary intakes","greatest proportion of intervention strategies","geographic access interventions","public policy levers","consumer purchasing","P strategies","fiscal strategies","promotion","underlying role of public policy","used robust dietary intake assessments","recent work","studies","RECENT FINDINGS","clearer evidence","state of evidence","consumer environments","earlier literature","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","positive effect","systematic review of population","placement","community","social planning","marketing","product","price","evaluations","design","comparison groups","Behavior","communication","multi-component","weight","natural experiments","randomized controlled trials","scope","development","field","Attention","conceptual frameworks","majority"],"language":"en"},

Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved enzymes that cause post-translational deimination, contributing to protein moonlighting in health and disease. PADs also regulate extracellular vesicle (EV) release, forming a critical part of cellular communication. As PAD-mediated mechanisms in bovine immunology and physiology remain to be investigated, this study profiled deimination signatures in serum and serum-EVs in Bos taurus. Bos EVs were poly-dispersed in a 70-500 nm size range and showed differences in deiminated protein cargo, compared with whole sera. Key immune, metabolic and gene regulatory proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated with some overlapping hits in sera and EVs (e.g., immunoglobulins), while some were unique to either serum or serum-EVs (e.g., histones). Protein-protein interaction network analysis of deiminated proteins revealed KEGG pathways common for serum and serum-EVs, including complement and coagulation cascades, viral infection (enveloped viruses), viral myocarditis, bacterial and parasitic infections, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency intestinal IgA production, B-cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, platelet activation and hematopoiesis, alongside metabolic pathways including ferroptosis, vitamin digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism and mineral absorption. KEGG pathways specific to EVs related to HIF-1 signalling, oestrogen signalling and biosynthesis of amino acids. KEGG pathways specific for serum only, related to Epstein-Barr virus infection, transcription mis-regulation in cancer, bladder cancer, Rap1 signalling pathway, calcium signalling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction. This indicates differences in physiological and pathological pathways for deiminated proteins in serum-EVs, compared with serum. Our findings may shed light on pathways underlying a number of pathological and anti-pathogenic (viral, bacterial, parasitic) pathways, with putative translatable value to human pathologies, zoonotic diseases and development of therapies for infections, including anti-viral therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Criscitiello, Michael F; Kraev, Igor; Lange, Sigrun","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21082861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KEGG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum-EVs","metabolic pathways","pathological pathways","Bos EVs","KEGG pathways specific","KEGG pathways common","oestrogen signalling","viral infection","deiminated protein cargo","Protein-protein interaction network analysis of deiminated proteins","calcium signalling pathway","Rap1 signalling pathway","anti-viral therapies","B-cell receptor signalling","viral myocarditis","protein moonlighting","parasitic infections","differences","PADs","sera","gene regulatory proteins","ECM-receptor interaction","post-translational deimination","bovine immune system","bladder cancer","autoimmune disease","number of pathological","mineral absorption","development of therapies","deimination signatures","bovine immunology","Bos taurus","natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity","PAD-mediated mechanisms","Epstein-Barr virus infection","immunodeficiency intestinal IgA production","platelet activation","human pathologies","zoonotic diseases","transcription mis-regulation","vitamin digestion","hematopoiesis","enveloped viruses","putative translatable value","coagulation cascades","cholesterol metabolism","ferroptosis","complement","HIF","conserved enzymes","unusual traits","biosynthesis of amino acids","release","extracellular vesicle","physiology","nm size range","overlapping hits","antiviral responses","health","immunoglobulins","study","Peptidylarginine deiminases","cellular communication","findings","poly","histones"],"language":"en"},

Few studies report the proportion of missing data and even fewer describe the methods used to adjust the results for missing data. The objective of this review was to determine the analytical methods used for analysis in HIV surveys with missing data. METHODS We searched for population, demographic and cross-sectional surveys of HIV published from January 2000 to April 2018 in Pub Med/Medline, Web of Science core collection, Latin American and Caribbean Sciences Literature, Africa-Wide Information and Scopus, and by reviewing references of included articles. All potential abstracts were imported into Covidence and abstracts screened by two independent reviewers using pre-specified criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. A piloted data extraction tool was used to extract data and assess the risk of bias of the eligible studies. Data were analysed through a quantitative approach; variables were presented and summarised using figures and tables. RESULTS A total of 3426 citations where identified, 194 duplicates removed, 3232 screened and 69 full articles were obtained. Twenty-four studies were included. The response rate for an HIV test of the included studies ranged from 32 to 96% with the major reason for the missing data being refusal to consent for an HIV test. Complete case analysis was the primary method of analysis used, multiple imputations 11(46%) was the most advanced method used, followed by the Heckman\u0027s selection model 9(38%). Single Imputation and Instrumental variables method were used in only two studies each, with 13(54%) other different methods used in several studies. Forty-two percent of the studies applied more than two methods in the analysis, with a maximum of 4 methods per study. Only 6(25%) studies conducted a sensitivity analysis, while 11(46%) studies had a significant change of estimates after adjusting for missing data. CONCLUSION Missing data in survey studies is still a problem in disease estimation. Our review outlined a number of methods that can be used to adjust for missing data on HIV studies; however, more information and awareness are needed to allow informed choices on which method to be applied for the estimates to be more reliable and representative.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mosha, Neema R; Aluko, Omololu S; Todd, Jim; Machekano, Rhoderick; Young, Taryn","journal":"BMC medical research methodology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-00944-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV studies","included studies","problem of missing data","proportion of missing data","CONCLUSION Missing data","survey studies","eligible studies","analytical methods","number of methods","different methods","BACKGROUND Sero- prevalence studies","HIV surveys","HIV test","piloted data extraction tool","primary method of analysis","sensitivity analysis","cross-sectional surveys of HIV","advanced method","Instrumental variables method","Complete case analysis","references of included articles","results","potential abstracts","Africa-Wide Information","significant change of estimates","Caribbean Sciences Literature","Web of Science core collection","Medline","independent reviewers","refusal","pre-specified criteria","Scopus","Covidence","Single Imputation","population","risk of bias","fewer","Pub Med","multiple imputations","major reason","awareness","informed choices","response rate","quantitative approach","maximum","disease estimation","Heckman\u0027s selection model","citations","duplicates","figures","study","Disagreements","discussion","total","tables","objective","percent"],"language":"en"},

In the conventional Glissonean approach from the liver hilum, the tertiary portal pedicles may be difficult to dissect because of their anatomical variations and deep location. We present a technique of purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy of the liver using the transfissural Glissonean approach. METHODS We performed purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. This approach involved initially opening the liver parenchyma along the fissure line (main portal, right portal, and umbilical fissures). Thereafter, the target tertiary portal pedicles were approached and ligated within the liver parenchyma above the liver hilum. RESULTS Between August 2014 and September 2019, we performed 17 cases of laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. The median operative time was 200 min (range 120-310 min), and the intraoperative blood loss was 80 mL (range 30-280 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range 3-9 days).

Endoscopic outcomes were evaluated in centres with routine endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS In total, 123 UC patients (95% anti-TNF, 62% vedolizumab and 3% ustekinumab experienced) were followed for a median duration of 24 weeks (interquartile range 12-26). The proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical, biochemical, and combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission rate at week 24 was 29% (n: 22/77), 25% (n: 14/57), and 19% (n: 11/57) respectively.

METHODS Twelve participants (mean \u00B1 SD; 25 \u00B1 4 years) exercised for 180 min at 3 METs in 40.1 \u00B1 0.6 \u00B0C, 40.4 \u00B1 2.1%RH four times: (i) consuming 20 \u00B0C water ad libitum (AL20); (ii) consuming 4 \u00B0C water ad libitum (AL4); (iii) replacing no fluids (NOFR); (iv) replacing sweat losses (FULLFR). Fluid consumption (FC), dehydration (%DEH), rectal temperature (Tre), rate-pressure product (RPP), forearm blood flow (FBF), mean skin temperature (Tsk), and local sweat rate (LSR) were measured/determined. RESULTS FC was greater in AL20 (1.30 \u00B1 0.41 L) than AL4 (1.03 \u00B1 0.32 L; P = 0.003). %DEH was lower (P \u003C 0.001) in AL20 (0.11 \u00B1 0.76%), AL4 (0.43 \u00B1 0.64%), and FULLFR (0.01 \u00B1 0.12%) compared to NOFR (1.93 \u00B1 0.28%). %DEH was lower in AL20 than AL4 (P = 0.003). In NOFR, end-trial changes in Tre were greater (P \u003C 0.001) (1.05 \u00B1 0.27 \u00B0C) compared to all other trials, but similar among AL20 (0.72 \u00B1 0.30 \u00B0C), AL4 (0.76 \u00B1 0.25 \u00B0C) and FULLFR (0.74 \u00B1 0.35 \u00B0C). End-trial RPP was higher (P \u003C 0.001) in NOFR (12,389 \u00B1 1578 mmHg\u00B7bpm) compared to all other trials, but similar among FULLFR (11,067 \u00B1 1292 mmHg\u00B7bpm), AL20 (11,214 \u00B1 2078 mmHg\u00B7bpm) and AL4 (11,089 \u00B1 1795 mmHg\u00B7bpm). No differences in Tsk or LSR were observed among trials, but FBF was lower in NOFR compared to FULLFR (2.84 \u00B1 0.69 vs. 3.52 \u00B1 0.96 ml/100 ml/min; P = 0.029). CONCLUSION 4 \u00B0C or 20 \u00B0C ad libitum water ingestion prevented dehydration levels that exacerbate thermal/cardiovascular strain, despite blunted fluid intake with 4 \u00B0C water. Higher core temperatures with NOFR are attributed to impaired internal heat distribution secondary to a lower FBF.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Connor; Morris, Nathan B; Harwood, Amy E; Jay, Ollie","journal":"European journal of applied physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-019-04283-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["L; P","NOFR","LSR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AL20","NOFR","AL4","C water ad libitum","C ad libitum water ingestion","FULLFR","mmHg","bpm","lower FBF","ad libitum water ingestion of different temperatures","trials","dehydration levels","cardiovascular strain","Tre","End-trial RPP","LSR","dehydration-related exacerbations of thermal","end-trial changes","Higher core temperatures","mean skin temperature","local sweat rate","rectal temperature","Fluid consumption","RESULTS FC","sweat losses","blunted fluid intake","rate-pressure product","impaired internal heat distribution secondary","exposure","forearm blood flow","conditions representative","SD","heatwave","METHODS","participants","PURPOSE","RH","times","years","differences","fluids","CONCLUSION","METs"],"language":"en"},

Multiple areas of surge planning progressed simultaneously focused on infection control, clinical operational challenges, intensive care unit surge capacity, staffing, ethics and maintenance of staff wellness. Protocols developed focused on clinical decisions around intubation, the use of high-flow oxygen, infectious disease consultation and cardiac arrest. Mechanisms to increase bed capacity as well as increase efficiency in intensive care units by outsourcing procedures were implemented. Novel uses of technology to minimize staff exposure to COVID-19, as well as to facilitate family engagement and end of life discussions were encouraged. Education and communication remained key in attempting to standardize care, stay apprized on emerging data as well as to review seminal literature on respiratory failure. Challenges were encountered, and overcome through interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative surge planning as intensive care unit admissions rose.

The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. Issue How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? Methods Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. Results Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. Conclusions A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horvath, Karl; Semlitsch, Thomas; Jeitler, Klaus; Krause, Robert; Siebenhofer, Andrea","journal":"Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2020.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AB","PPW","PPV"],"locations":["Austria","Germany"],"keyphrases":["Positive test results","negative test results","low pre-test probability","increased pre-test probability","test properties","AB test systems","pretest probability","high test quality","concrete test result","Results Sensitivity","application of antibody test systems","specificity of different SARS-CoV","prevalence of SARS","specific antibodies","infection","actual presence of SARS","positive predictive value","case of positive","high sensitivity","negative predictive value","respective affected persons","lower sensitivity","PPW","assumed prevalence","PPV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","prerequisites","inferences","context","significance","detection of virus","pandemic","reliability","substantial differences","general population","Austria","Germany","Issue","high-risk professions","considerations","NPV","Conclusions","Introduction","increasing role","immunity","Methods Calculation","absence"],"language":"en"},

Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin. Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rios, Patricia; Radhakrishnan, Amruta; Antony, Jesmin; Thomas, Sonia M.; Muller, Mathew; Straus, Sharon E.; Tricco, Andrea C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["clinicaltrials.gov","Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cohort studies","observational studies","database studies","unpublished studies","eligible studies","MERS patients","hospitalized SARS","ribavirin prophylactic treatment","COVID","Additional therapies","current evidence","safety of antiviral therapies","reduced risk of MERS infection","additional searches","mortality rates","ongoing trials","cohort study","controlled trials","retrospective study","conclusive evidence of effectiveness","novel coronavirus","treatment recommendations","common treatment","unspecified coronavirus","significant results","antiviral therapy","retrospective medical record","existing body of evidence","severe acute respiratory syndrome","middle east respiratory syndrome","lack of well-designed prospective trials","current outbreak","significant increase","monoclonal antibodies","harmful adverse events","rates of ICU admission","risk of bias appraisal","effective medical countermeasures","Comprehensive literature searches","potential drug-related adverse effects","anemia","gastrointestinal symptoms","altered liver function","data abstraction","Epidemiology Network","MEDLINE","EMBASE","text screening","Methods","broad spectrum antibiotics","Global Infectious Diseases","experienced librarian","future investigations","Cochrane Library","GIDEON","antivirals","case reports","people","favour","combination of lopinavir","candidates","ritonavir","various interferons","single reviewers","Title","series","Background","Conclusion","steroids","oseltamivir"],"language":"en"},

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. Methods: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to March 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios representing the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. Findings: In the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between Dec 2019 and early Jan 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 2 - 8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, simulated case counts were likely in the hundreds. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Interpretation: Our results indicate that the cordon sanitaire may not have prevented COVID-19 spread in major Chinese cities; local non-pharmaceutical interventions were likely more important for this.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quilty, Billy J; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Gibbs, Hamish; Russell, Timothy W; Jarvis, Christopher I; Prem, Kiesha; Pearson, Carl A B; Clifford, Samuel J; Flasche, Stefan; Klepac, Petra; Eggo, Rosalind M; Jit, Mark","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7662e461bdac4972293ba461b73f4b7be24cb387.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067504v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Lunar New Year"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["cordon sanitaire","destination cities","smaller cities","major Chinese cities","representative major cities","Wuhan","spread of COVID","estimated COVID","onset of local transmission of COVID","prevented COVID","high prevalence of COVID","effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions","mainland China","parts of China","infected arrivals","holiday travel","number of infected travellers","simulated case counts","reduced transmissibility scenarios","potential independent contribution","combination","Shenzhen","place","introduction","stochastic branching processes","Hangzhou","Lunar New Year","available mobility data","Chongqing","hundreds","results","Beijing","outbreaks","epidemic progression","efficacy","time","Interpretation","Methods","Background","Findings"],"language":"en"}]}

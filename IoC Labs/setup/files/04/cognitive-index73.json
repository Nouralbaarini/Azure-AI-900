Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy with overlapping clinical and imaging features with COVID-19, however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury. We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results. Methods The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed. The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 3/1/2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing. Results Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed. Three out of four patients tested positive for COVID-19. All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field. Conclusions As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention. We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaverdian, Narek; Shepherd, Annemarie; Rimner, Andreas; Wu, Abraham J.; Simone, Charles B.; Gelblum, Daphna Y.; Gomez, Daniel R.","journal":"Adv Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbd371f5f6fba3a14748b86f695be4fdf7f67cf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199721.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300919?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377597/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regional COVID","high-risk patients","Introduction Patients","symptoms of RP","presumed RP","potential exacerbation of COVID","imaging findings of consecutive patients","clinical course","chest CT imaging","clinical suspicion","clinical deterioration","Chest CT findings","symptoms of cough","imaging features","high-dose corticosteroids","empiric corticosteroids","testing results","chest computed tomography","empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper","careful attention","diagnostic attention","Radiation pneumonitis","radiation field","qualitative RNA testing","common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy","order","cancer","mortality","coronavirus-disease","Methods","epidemic","intensification","ground-glass opacities","associated lung injury","pandemic","dyspnea","Conclusions","case","fever","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

However, this requires that the validity and reliability of the data be evaluated for the purpose for which they are to be used. This manuscript reports an evaluation of milk shipment data for evaluating their usefulness in disease monitoring and the resilience of organic and conventional dairy herds in Sweden. A large number of inconsistencies were observed in the data, necessitating substantial efforts to \u201Cclean\u201D the data. Given that the selection of rules used in the cleaning process was subjective in nature, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine if different cleaning routines produced substantially different results. Despite the cleaning efforts we observed far more large residuals at the shipment level than expected. Thus, it was concluded that the data were too \u201Cnoisy\u201D to be used for identification of short term impacts on milk production. Resilience was evaluated by examining the residual variance in milk shipped per cow per day under the assumption that herds with high resilience would have lower residual variance. The effects on residual variance of organic status or whether or not the herd used an automatic milking system were evaluated in models in which the residual variance was stratified or not by these factors. We did not find consistent evidence to suggest that organic herds had higher resilience than conventional herds, but this could be partly due to using residual variance as the measure indicating resilience.","publish_time":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fall, Nils; Ohlson, Anna; Emanuelson, Ulf; Dohoo, Ian","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56fbff6b22621efffbbdf03b693dea809e83c377.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114288.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587717308097; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587717308097; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["resilience of organic","lower residual variance","organic herds","residual variance of organic status","recorded data","conventional herds","high resilience","higher resilience","evaluation of milk shipment data","cleaning efforts","conventional dairy herds","milk production","different cleaning routines","cleaning process","disease surveillance","disease monitoring","different results","large residuals","shipment level","substantial efforts","large number of inconsistencies","research purposes","usefulness","nature","identification of short term impacts","assumption","models","cow","automatic milking system","day","Sweden","effects","attractive proposition","sensitivity analysis","manuscript","consistent evidence","measure","selection of rules","validity","reliability","factors"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrated that sequence alterations in the coat protein (CP)-binding cis-acting RNA motifs, the Bbox region (in the intercistronic RNA3 sequence) and the RNA3 packaging element (PE, in the movement protein ORF), reduced crossover frequencies in protoplasts. Additionally, the modification of Bbox-like element in the 5\u2032 UTR region strongly debilitated crossovers. Along the lines of these observations, RNA3 mutants not expressing CP or expressing mutated CPs also reduced recombination. A series of reciprocal transfections demonstrated a functional crosstalk between the Bbox and PE elements. Altogether, our data imply the role of CP in sgRNA3a-directed recombination by either facilitating the interaction of the RNA substrates and/or by creating roadblocks for the viral replicase.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska, Joanna; Fanning, Sean W.; Horn, James R.; Bujarski, Jozef J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40bb91258ab5515b39230e66bdf4f556ab10a17c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114393.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.10.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212003711; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212003711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23079110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA3 mutants","Bbox region","RNA3 packaging element","intercistronic RNA3 sequence","role of CP","sgRNA3a","modification of Bbox","genomic RNA3 of Brome mosaic virus","coat protein","UTR region","barley protoplasts","PE elements","sequence alterations","efficient homologous recombination system","RNA substrates","movement protein ORF","reduced crossover frequencies","cis-acting RNA motifs","BMV","functional crosstalk","subgenomic RNA3a","observations","series of reciprocal transfections","Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska","mutated CPs","roadblocks","debilitated crossovers","lines","interaction","viral replicase","data"],"language":"en"},

Polymerase chain reaction-amplified 784-bp specific ORT DNA fragments were found in 7 ORT isolates from lungs, air sacs, and tracheas of commercial broilers or layers in Egypt in 2015. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the live variant IBV 4/91 with ORT infection. A total of 120 14-d-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500) were equally divided into 4 groups for experimental infection in a complete randomized design. Group 1 was infected with ORT strain and live infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV 4/91) simultaneously; group 2 was infected with the bacterial strain alone; group 3 was vaccinated only with IBV 4/91, and group 4 was the non-vaccinated and non-infected control group. The respiratory signs, post-mortem lesions (tracheitis and pneumonia) and histopathological findings of lungs, trachea, and air sacs in the experimentally infected broiler chickens appeared to be more prominent in the chickens of group 1 than group 2. With respect to body weight, weight gain, feed conversion rate, and Ornithobacterium re-isolation, there was a difference (P \u2264 0.05) among the chickens of group 1 and the other groups. This reveals that the use of live infectious bronchitic vaccines, which is a common practice in the local Egyptian field of production, may concomitantly increase the pathogenicity of ORT in broiler chickens.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellakany, H.

A strength of the technology is that it is based on principles of rational design, and the tools of gene therapy are now highly versatile. For example gene silencing and gene editing may be used to disable viral genes for therapeutic purposes. Gene therapy may thus lead to cure from infections with HIV-1, hepatitis B virus and Ebola virus, which are of significant public health importance in Africa. Although enthusiasm for gene therapy is justified, significant challenges to implementing the technology remain. These include ensuring efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to target cells, limiting unintended effects, cost and complexity of treatment regimens. In addition, implementation of effective legislation that will govern gene therapy research will be a challenge. Nevertheless, it is an exciting prospect that gene therapy should soon reach the mainstream of medical management.

On 28 May 2008, the French National Reference Center for Rabies (Institut Pasteur, Paris) confirmed the rabies diagnosis, based on hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction on skin biopsy and saliva specimens from a Guianan, who had never travelled overseas and died in Cayenne after presenting clinically typical meningoencephalitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Molecular typing of the virus identified a Lyssavirus (Rabies virus species), closely related to those circulating in hematophagous bats (mainly Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America. A multidisciplinary Crisis Unit was activated. Its objectives were to implement an epidemiological investigation and a veterinary survey, to provide control measures and establish a communications program. The origin of the contamination was not formally established, but was probably linked to a bat bite based on the virus type isolated. After confirming exposure of 90 persons, they were vaccinated against rabies: 42 from the case\u0027s entourage and 48 healthcare workers. To handle that emergence and the local population\u0027s increased demand to be vaccinated, a specific communications program was established using several media: television, newspaper, radio. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This episode, occurring in the context of a Department far from continental France, strongly affected the local population, healthcare workers and authorities, and the management team faced intense pressure. This observation confirms that the risk of contracting rabies in French Guiana is real, with consequences for population educational program, control measures, medical diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2012-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meynard, Jean-Baptiste; Flamand, Claude; Dupuy, C\u00E9line; Mahamat, Aba; Eltges, Fran\u00E7oise; Queuche, Frederic; Renner, Julien; Fontanella, Jean-Michel; Hommel, Didier; Dussart, Philippe; Grangier, Claire; Djossou, F\u00E9lix; Dacheux, Laurent; Goudal, Maryvonne; Berger, Franck; Ardillon, Vanessa; Krieger, Nicolas; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9; Spiegel, Andr\u00E9","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e9f9684ec67208f02fa5b822b18ccfa79ca6b6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3283561.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22363830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cayenne","Latin America","French Guiana"],"keyphrases":["rabies diagnosis","human rabies","Rabies virus species","risk of contracting rabies","French Guiana","control measures","population educational program","healthcare workers","specific communications program","virus type isolated","medical diagnosis","French National Reference Center","post-exposure prophylaxis","local population\u0027s increased demand","skin biopsy","hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction","consequences","Institut Pasteur","authorities","saliva specimens","Molecular typing","Desmodus rotundus","veterinary survey","media","Lyssavirus","Paris","management team","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","epidemiological investigation","METHODOLOGY","emergence","continental France","case\u0027s entourage","bat bite","episode","context","television","newspaper","radio","Department","intense pressure","hematophagous bats","Latin America","Guianan","Cayenne","typical meningoencephalitis","multidisciplinary Crisis Unit","CONCLUSION","SIGNIFICANCE","objectives","observation","BACKGROUND","persons","origin","contamination"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we targeted viral pathogens, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of isolated viral pathogens between leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 and 29 leopard cats that were live-trapped and found dead, respectively, were collected from Miaoli County from 2015 to 2019 in northwestern Taiwan. CPPV-1 and coronavirus were detected in leopard cats. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of CPPV-1, and CoV was 63.5% (50.4%\u201376.6%) and 8.8% (0%\u201318.4%), respectively. The majority of sequences of each CPPV-1 strain amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All the amplified CoV sequences from leopard cats were identified as feline coronavirus. The spatial and temporal aggregation of CPPV-1 infection in leopard cats was not determined in the sampling area, which indicated a wide distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified. We strongly recommend establishing efforts to manage CPPV-1 and FCoV in the leopard cat habitat, with an emphasis on vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats.

In this study, we targeted highly pathogenic viral pathogens in wild cat species, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. Furthermore, we collected the epidemiological and phylogenetic data to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens in the wild leopard cat population and identified the possible origin of target pathogens. Based on our study, we consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified. Our study provides a deeper understanding related to the distribution of target viral pathogens in the wild leopard cats. The information is essential for leopard cat conservation and pathogen management.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chen-Chih; Chang, Ai-Mei; Chen, Wan-Jhen; Chang, Po-Jen; Lai, Yu-Ching; Lee, Hsu-Hsun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2cea481baa610d54622d395133b91ac70ca85e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.960492","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["wild leopard cats","leopard cat conservation","leopard cat habitat","Taiwanese leopard cats","wild leopard cat population","distribution of target viral pathogens","pathogenic viral pathogens","feline coronavirus","wild cat species","temporal aggregation of CPPV","study","possible origin of target pathogens","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","wide distribution of CPPV","phylogenetic relationship of isolated viral pathogens","sympatric domestic carnivores","amplified CoV sequences","wildlife population","endangered species","temporal dynamics","FeLV","probable primary reservoir","FIV","Prionailurus bengalensis","carnivore protoparvovirus","CMV","canine morbillivirus","phylogenetic data","phylogenetic analysis","molecular screening","northwestern Taiwan","population control measures","Wildlife Conservation Act","majority of sequences","emphasis","vaccination programs","free-roaming dogs","strain","infection","pathogen management","information","IMPORTANCE","FCoV","effects of infectious diseases","deeper understanding","sampling area","confidence interval","prevalence","sequencing","Samples","Miaoli County","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Antibody-mediated virus internalization is an Fc-mediated function that may act at the portal of entry whereby effector cells may be triggered by pre-existing antibodies to prevent HIV-1 acquisition. Understanding the capacity of HIV-1 antibodies in mediating internalization of HIV-1 virions by primary monocytes is critical to understanding their full antiviral potency. Antibody isotypes/subclasses differ in functional profile, with consequences for their antiviral activity. For instance, in the RV144 vaccine trial that achieved partial efficacy, Env IgA correlated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. decreased vaccine efficacy), whereas V1-V2 IgG3 correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. increased vaccine efficacy). Thus, understanding the different functional attributes of HIV-1 specific IgG1, IgG3 and IgA antibodies will help define the mechanisms of immune protection. Here, we utilized an in vitro flow cytometric method utilizing primary monocytes as phagocytes and infectious HIV-1 virions as targets to determine the capacity of Env IgA (IgA1, IgA2), IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies to mediate HIV-1 infectious virion internalization. Importantly, both broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. PG9, 2G12, CH31, VRC01 IgG) and non-broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. 7B2 mAb, mucosal HIV-1\u002B IgG) mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, we found that Env IgG3 of multiple specificities (i.e. CD4bs, V1-V2 and gp41) mediated increased infectious virion internalization over Env IgG1 of the same specificity, while Env IgA mediated decreased infectious virion internalization compared to IgG1. These data demonstrate that antibody-mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions depends on antibody specificity and isotype. Evaluation of the phagocytic potency of vaccine-induced antibodies and therapeutic antibodies will enable a better understanding of their capacity to prevent and/or control HIV-1 infection in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tay, Matthew Zirui; Liu, Pinghuang; Williams, LaTonya D.; McRaven, Michael D; Sawant, Sheetal; Gurley, Thaddeus C; Xu, Thomas T.; Dennison, S.

The CD-NTase family also includes uncharacterized human genes like MB21D2 and Mab21L1, highlighting emerging functions of cGAS-like signaling beyond innate immunity.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kranzusch, Philip J","journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccb1a8256c417a6de3d98b783f3ef08f4c74c1e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127440.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X19300478; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959440X19300478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2019.08.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vibrio"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["family of cGAS","emerging functions of cGAS","CD-NTase family","DncV homologs","recent discoveries of diverse structural homologs of cGAS","cyclic dinucleotides","cyclic trinucleotides","Cyclic GMP","human cells","uncharacterized human genes","Vibrio cholerae protein dinucleotide cyclase","Mab21L1","noncanonical RNA signals","MB21D2","enzymes","animals","immune-sensing","framework","nucleotidyltransferase","AMP synthase","bacteria","linear oligonucleotides","cytosolic DNA","biochemical breakthroughs","biology","environmental conditions","innate immunity"],"language":"en"},

However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \u201CCandidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\u201D (CMhm) and \u201CCandidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\u201D (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. RESULTS: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with \u201CCandidatus M. haemominutum\u201D and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with \u201CCandidatus M. haemominutum\u201D and \u201CCandidatus M. turicensis\u201D and another one (0.17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus \u201CM. turicensis\u201D. Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that \u201CCa. Mycoplasma haemominutum\u201D, Mycoplasma haemofelis and \u201CCa. Mycoplasma turicensis\u201D are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, \u201CCa. Mycoplasma haemominutum\u201D being the most prevalent species. More studies are necessary to help understand the role of the natural infection by these species of hemoplasma in cats.","publish_time":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDaz-Rega\u00F1\u00F3n, David; Villaescusa, Alejandra; Ayll\u00F3n, Tania; Rodr\u00EDguez-Franco, Fernando; Garc\u00EDa-Sancho, Mercedes; Agulla, Beatriz; Sainz, \u00C1ngel","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3f7e8c04762fc684f7ebfda560df8492e29929a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5859754.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2740-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hemotropic","M. haemominutum"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["stray cats","Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum","Mycoplasma haemofelis","Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis","infecting cats","client-owned cats","hemotropic mycoplasma infection","feline hemoplasma infections","DNA of feline hemoplasmas","epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas","species of hemoplasma","prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas","infecting client","Mhf","higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas","central Spain","region of Spain","group of client","Madrid area","clinical findings","natural infection","collection of blood","blood samples","CMhm","studies","CMt","retrovirus status","clinical signs","epidemiological parameters","laboratory findings","prevalent species","FIV positivity status","erythrocyte count","environment","prophylaxis measures","warm months","data","existence of low haematocrit","signalment","FeLV","risk factors","haemoglobin concentration values","PCR","adult age","outdoor access","cat population","METHODS","Polymerase chain reaction","associations","Male gender","role","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","research","knowledge","order","study","purpose","CONCLUSIONS","total"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the genotypic diversity and epidemiology of HRV among children with SARI. Thus, we investigated the genotypic diversity and epidemiology of HRV in children with SARI in China over a 2-year period. In total 1,003, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children hospitalized with SARI in Shanghai from 2013 to 2015. HRV was screened for by a PCR method targeting the viral 5\u2032 UTR and was genotyped by sequencing of the VP4\u2013VP2 region of the HRV genome. We also screened for 15 other common respiratory viruses to assess the prevalence of co-infection with HRV. The patient demographic and clinical data were reviewed. HRV was detected in 280 (27.9%) of the 1,003 specimens: HRV-A in 140 (14.0%), HRV-B in 21 (2.1%), HRV-C in 56 (5.6%), and HRV-untyped in 63 (6.3%). A phylogenetic analysis identified 77 genotypes (43 HRV-A, 10 HRV-B, and 24 HRV-C), among which A78, A12, A89, B70, C2, C6, and C24 predominated. HRV-A was detected mainly in winter 2013 and autumn 2014, while HRV-C detection peaked in autumn 2013 and 2014. The detection frequency of HRV-A was highest in patients \u003C5 years old. Most HRV co-infections involved adenovirus, human bocavirus, and/or human respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, HRV-A and -C predominate in children with SARI in Shanghai. Among the 77 genotypes detected, A78, A12, A89, B70, C2, C6, and C24 were the most frequent. The HRV species responsible for SARIs differs according to season and age.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yanjie; Shen, Jun; Wu, Bingjie; Liu, Gaoshan; Lu, Roujian; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57d6bf2cc1fc387a33ba3ff4343e0bbd7a12dfaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6090050.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30131797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","HRV","PCR"],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of HRV","HRV-B","HRV genome","HRV-C detection","HRV co-infections","detection frequency of HRV","HRV species responsible","children","A89","B70","human bocavirus","SARIs","A12","C6","A78","human respiratory syncytial virus","Human rhinovirus","genotypic diversity","autumn","C24","genotypes","Shanghai","common respiratory viruses","cause of severe acute respiratory infections","prevalence of co-infection","VP2 region","adenovirus","China","sequencing","patients","VP4","patient demographic","clinical data","UTR","years old","season","PCR method","nasopharyngeal aspirates","phylogenetic analysis","year period","age","winter","specimens","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Both encode putative mature proteins of 579 and 592 aa respectively in addition to a 24 aa signal peptide. Sequence analysis revealed that only one of the two cDNA clones encodes a putative ER retention signal, K/QEDDL, followed by a serine phosphorylation site conserved with mammalian homologs. Amino acid sequence alignment illustrated conservation of the calnexin luminal domain, which consists of a globular and a P domain, in both copies. Southern blotting revealed that there are at least two copies of the calnexin gene in the trout genome and northern blotting showed a wide tissue distribution of an estimated 3 kbp calnexin transcript with an additional minor transcript of 2.3 kbp expressed only in head kidney, spleen PBLs and strongly in RTS11. Importantly, the smaller transcript was predominantly upregulated in RTS11 after a 24 h treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. In western blots, calnexin was detected primarily as a 120 kDa protein and upon A23187 treatment; a 100 kDa band was most prominently expressed. These results suggest that in salmonids there are two differentiated versions of the calnexin gene which encode proteins that may have diverged to perform unique biological functions.","publish_time":"2013-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sever, Lital; Vo, Nguyen T.K.; Bols, Niels C.; Dixon, Brian","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d609ca173bc158333f107a17d192b9960886e4b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103213.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X13002577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060503/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X13002577; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.09.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Calnexin"],"organizations":["MHC","K/QEDDL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calnexin gene","kbp calnexin transcript","calnexin luminal domain","unique cDNA clones of calnexin","A23187 treatment","smaller transcript","kDa protein","RTS11","copies","putative ER retention signal","additional minor transcript","aa signal peptide","putative mature proteins","h treatment","trout genome","northern blotting","rainbow trout","P domain","kDa band","Southern blotting","Sequence analysis","integral membrane protein","calcium ionophore A23187","unique biological functions","Amino acid sequence alignment","conservation","wide tissue distribution","folding","endoplasmic reticulum","synthesized N-linked glycoproteins","QEDDL","P88","serine phosphorylation site","mammalian homologs","spleen PBLs","head kidney","MHC class","identification","differentiated versions","salmonids","molecule","IP90","manuscript","western blots","results"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morawska, Lidia; Cao, Junji","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9db4bec57904c4c86b8960097988307c00bc4e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151430.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202031254X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294574/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105730; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016041202031254X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indoor air","virus-laden droplets","distance of meters","virus spreads","airborne spread of COVID","social distance","main measures","indoor environments","tens of meters","national authorities","inhalation of small droplets","significant route of infection","adequate control measures","reality","infected person","ventilation","removal","World Health Organization","transport","evidence","regulations","Hand washing","countries","Science","mechanisms","infections transmission","SARS-CoV","viral content"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to analyze the recovery of immune response after a bronchiolitis episode. METHODS: Forty-nine infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis diagnosis were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were processed. Twenty-seven pro-inflammatory biomarkers linked to innate immunity, inflammation, and epithelial damage, as well as nitrites and lipid mediators, were evaluated in the NPA supernatant by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and Luminex. Also, 11 genes were analyzed in NPA cells by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A widespread statistically significant decline of multiple pro-inflammatory parameters and cytokines were detected in the recovery period after respiratory infection: interferon-\u03B12 (IFN\u03B12), IFN\u03B3, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, IFN-\u03B3-inducible protein-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03B1 (MIP-1\u03B1), and MIP-1\u03B2. Supporting these results, a decreased nuclear factor-\u03BAB gene expression was observed (P = 0.0116). A significant diminution of cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) soluble levels (P = 0.0319) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression were observed in the recovery sample. In children classified by post-bronchiolitis wheezing, LTC4 remains elevated in the NPA supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: After bronchiolitis, cytokines and biomarkers linked to innate immune response in NPA decrease significantly in the recovery period accompanied by a drop in LTC4 levels; however, this reduction was lower in infants with post-bronchiolitis wheezing.","publish_time":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sastre, Beatriz; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Casas, Inmaculada; Rodrigo-Mu\u00F1oz, Jos\u00E9 Manuel; Ca\u00F1as, Jos\u00E9 Antonio; Mora, In\u00E9s; del Pozo, Victoria","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56a6eea69f7aad91a41af372aa9021d6a72a8a60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086521.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0606-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bronchiolitis","Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":["NPA","Luminex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchiolitis diagnosis","bronchiolitis episode","post-bronchiolitis wheezing","immune mechanism of bronchiolitis","recovery period","NPA supernatant","recovery of immune response","LTC4 levels","NPA cells","recovery sample","macrophage inflammatory protein","pro-inflammatory biomarkers","inducible protein","cytokines","infants","RESULTS","MIP","monocyte chemoattractant protein","significant decline of multiple pro-inflammatory parameters","decreased nuclear factor-\u03BAB gene expression","soluble levels","children younger","innate immunity","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","vascular endothelial growth factor","significant diminution of cysteinyl leukotriene C4","main cause of hospitalization","ELISA","interferon-\u03B12","respiratory infection","IFN\u03B12","inflammation","year","reduction","epithelial damage","IFN-\u03B3","nitrites","IFN\u03B3","drop","Luminex","interleukin","quantitative PCR","COX","BACKGROUND","lipid mediators","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","NPAs","cyclooxygenase","study","genes","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Alb 18), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Alb18 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor.

To test the viability of CHV in baits, CHV was freeze-dried, incorporated into different baits, stored, and the remaining viral infectivity tested in cell culture after varying periods of time at different storage temperatures. Experimental baits (mouse carcasses) and commercial baits (FOXOFF and PROBAIT) were prepared with either liquid or freeze-dried CHV and tested in two fox trials for their capacity to induce CHV-specific antibodies following oral baiting. Freeze-drying and storage temperatures below 0\u00B0C had a stabilizing effect to virus infectivity. When stored at \u221220\u00B0C, freeze-dried CHV retained its full infectivity for up to 3 months in PROBAIT baits, the remaining infectivity in FOXOFF baits was 100-fold less. Oral baiting with CHV induced antiviral serum antibodies in all vaccinated foxes (20/20). None of the vaccinated foxes became ill or shed infectious virus into the environment although viral DNA was detected in body secretions as evaluated by PCR. The results indicate that CHV can be freeze-dried and stored over extended periods of time without loosing much of its infectivity. This is the first report of CHV being used for oral bait vaccination of foxes.

In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin. METHODS: Full genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples. Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85\u201395%, and four 30\u201350% genome coverage. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done. FINDINGS: Three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction. INTERPRETATION: We present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far. MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R(0) values. Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.

We analyzed the evolution of the spike (S) gene in betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) isolated from different mammals, in bat coronavirus populations, as well as in MERS-CoV strains from the current outbreak. Results indicated several positively selected sites located in the region comprising the two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and their linker. Two sites (R652 and V1060) were positively selected in the betaCoVs phylogeny and correspond to mutations associated with expanded host range in other coronaviruses. During the most recent evolution of MERS-CoV, adaptive mutations in the HR1 (Q/R/H1020) arose in camels or in a previous host and spread to humans. We determined that different residues at position 1020 establish distinct inter- and intra-helical interactions and affect the stability of the six-helix bundle formed by the HRs. A similar effect on stability was observed for a nearby mutation (T1015N) that increases MERS-CoV infection efficiency in vitro. Data herein indicate that the heptad repeat region was a major target of adaptive evolution in MERS-CoV-related viruses; these results are relevant for the design of fusion inhibitor peptides with antiviral function.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forni, Diego; Filippi, Giulia; Cagliani, Rachele; De Gioia, Luca; Pozzoli, Uberto; Al-Daghri, Nasser; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e73ff88b8e995535a2783a7ba78a743afd557a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4585914.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep14480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404138/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV strains","MERS-CoV infection efficiency","recent evolution of MERS","adaptive mutations","HR1","stability","region","camels","Results","humans","selected sites","major target of adaptive evolution","different mammals","different residues","heptad repeats","previous host","betaCoVs phylogeny","bat coronavirus populations","expanded host range","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","design of fusion inhibitor peptides","intra-helical interactions","related viruses","position","betacoronaviruses","antiviral function","gene","spike","HR2","H1020","T1015N","bats","zoonotic transmission","nearby mutation","current outbreak","helix bundle","HRs","R652","V1060","similar effect","linker","Data"],"language":"en"},

However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1\u20137 days after onset), intermediate stage (8\u201314 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen\u0027s kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yunbao; Li, Xinran; Yang, Gui; Fan, Junli; Tang, Yueting; Zhao, Jin; Long, Xinghua; Guo, Shuang; Zhao, Ziwu; Liu, Yinjuan; Hu, Hanning; Xue, Han; Li, Yirong","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce45e65de2c8572f1d3f9d1c88a381035a44e2fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195339.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301754; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["ICG"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nucleic acid detection","days","ICG detection capacity","serological ICG strip assay","sensitivity of ICG assay","nucleic acid-negative suspected cases","IgG combinatorial detection","real-time RT-PCR","intermediate stage","late stage","onset","early stage","viral IgM","IgG antibody","blood samples","types of samples","serological methods","outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV","false-negative rate","excellent supplementary approach","standard diagnostic approach","plasma","technique","colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic","Cohen\u0027s kappa value","clinical application","concordance","infection","conclusion","perfect agreement","cities","China","addition","Wuhan","nations"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we therefore focus on recent developments to generate antivirals targeting host cell factors or immune-based therapeutic approaches to fight infections with enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wisskirchen, Karin; Lucifora, Julie; Michler, Thomas; Protzer, Ulrike","journal":"Trends in Pharmacological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9ebcd4076cc60f11f168f1268ecbb081ba9a30b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112871.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108320/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165614714001047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614714001047; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2014.06.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Enveloped viruses","Persistent viruses","emerging viruses","host cell factors essential","host immune control","immune-based therapies","therapeutic approaches","alternative approaches","broad-spectrum antivirals","virus persistence","efficient strategies","fight infections","important health threat","treatment options","recent developments","need","review"],"language":"en"},

Despite ongoing efforts, antiviral drugs to treat many of the most troubling viruses have not been approved yet. The recent launch of new antimicrobials is generating hope as more and more pathogens around the world become resistant to available drugs. But extra effort is still needed. One of the current strategies for antiviral and antibiotic drug development is the search for host cellular pathways used by many different pathogens. For example, many viruses and bacteria alter lipid synthesis and transport to build their own organelles inside infected cells. The characterization of these interactions will be fundamental to identify new targets for antiviral and antibiotic drug development. This review discusses how viruses and bacteria subvert cell machineries for lipid synthesis and transport and summarises the most promising compounds that interfere with these pathways.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez\u2010Oliva, Alberto; Ortega\u2010Gonz\u00E1lez, Paula; Risco, Cristina","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae2b25d3dc787647ea4ff6e49e3e559c5651ad6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162424.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585688/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bacteria","antiviral drugs","troubling viruses","antibiotic drug development","transport","lipid synthesis","new targets","different pathogens","available drugs","host cellular pathways","recent launch of new antimicrobials","search","cell machineries","current strategies","world","hope","serious challenges","organelles","interactions","humans","promising compounds","ongoing efforts","infected cells","characterization","example","review","extra effort"],"language":"en"},

There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City\u2019s Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at \u201Clow (but not zero) risk\u201D and \u201Csome or high risk\u201D: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.","publish_time":"2017-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reich, Nicholas G; Lessler, Justin; Varma, Jay K; Vora, Neil M","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5161b031c7f720562e94735a018d1c3c8be3ae5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9adb19524da703abb1bed7fc7c434ec3899a8051.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/156497","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["West Africa Ebola"],"keyphrases":["intensity of active monitoring","unique durations of active monitoring","costs of specific durations of active monitoring","optimal length of active monitoring relative","New York City\u2019s Ebola active monitoring program","expected costs","MERS-CoV","smallpox","high risk","West Africa Ebola outbreak","median incubation period","exposure-risk categories","pathogens of significant public health concern","important public health activity","month period","infected individuals","limited data","variable incubation periods","outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens","response","performance","cornerstone","disease transmission","risks","bioterror threats","CDC","analysis","lives","Guidance","morbidity","framework","days","Resources"],"language":"en"},

Previously, the domain III-truncated enzyme was demonstrated to fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold, but it showed no enzyme activity. To further delineate the structure\u2013function relationships of the domain III and the long loop, we generated some truncated and mutated M(pro) forms bearing various combinations of the loop with other structural parts of the enzyme. Their conformational and association properties were investigated in detail. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed that these fragments could fold independently. The secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of these mixtures were monitored by CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. However, no enzyme activity was observed for any mutant or mixtures.

The K40/09 strain was selected during successive serial passages in specific-pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs at sub-optimal higher temperature (56\u00B0C). Unlike the parental strain, the attenuated strain, designated K40/09 HP50, was found to be safe in 1-day-old SPF chicks, which showed neither mortality nor signs of morbidity, and rarely induced ciliostasis or histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular and fine-spray administration. K40/09 HP50 provided almost complete protection against two distinct subgroups of a nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup) and elicited the production of high titers of neutralizing antibody (neutralization index of 3.6). We conclude that the K40/09 HP50 vaccine virus is rapidly attenuated by heat adaptation and exhibits the desired level of attenuation, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy required for a live attenuated vaccine.

The goal of the meeting was to harmonize the immunoassays used for pertussis diagnostics and vaccine evaluation, as agreed upon by academic and government researchers, regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The primary objectives were (1) to provide epidemiologic, laboratory, and statistical background for support of global harmonization; (2) to overview the current status of global epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunology of pertussis; (3) to develop a consensus opinion on existing gaps in understanding standardization of pertussis assays used for serodiagnosis and vaccine evaluation; and (4) to search for a multicenter process for addressing these priority gaps. Presentations and discussions by content experts addressed these objectives. A prioritized list of action items to improve standardization and harmonization of pertussis assays was identified during a group discussion at the end of the meeting. The major items included: (1) to identify a group that will organize, prepare, maintain, and distribute proficiency panels and key reagents such as reference and control sera; (2) to encourage the development and identification of one or more reference laboratories that can serve as an anchor and resource for other laboratories; (3) to define a performance-based assay method that can serve as a reference point for evaluating laboratory differences; (4) to develop guidance on quality of other reagents, e.g., pertussis toxin and other antigens, and methods to demonstrate their suitability; (5) to establish an international working group to harmonize the criteria to evaluate the results obtained on reference and proficiency panel sera; (6) to create an inventory to determine the amount of appropriate and well-characterized sera that are available globally to be used as bridging reagents for vaccine licensure; and (7) to seek specific guidance from regulatory authorities regarding the expectations and requirements for the licensure of new multicomponent pertussis vaccines.","publish_time":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tondella, M.

The harmonized management of biological risks in such diverse laboratories thus appears as a real challenge. Zhejiang Province in China has taken the initiative to establish a comprehensively integrated laboratory biosafety management system called SINS (Standardization, Informatization, Normalization and Systematization). The SINS model system has been introduced and adopted in 1,721 BSL-2 laboratories in Zhejiang Province, and thus lead to an increase in the number of biosafety committees from 20% to more than 95% from 2007 to 2018, and the number of biosafety laboratory managers who knows biosafety-related laws and regulations increase from 52.7% to 83.7% from 2009 to 2017. Such achievements indicate that the successful implementation of SINS model has increased the effective control of biological risks in BSL-2 laboratories of the Zhejiang Province. SINS model and its main effects on leading the improvement of laboratory biosafety management was presented in this review. The SINS model helps to strengthen laboratory biosafety and thus effectively reduces occurrence of biosafety-related incidences. This model can potentially be used by other regions or countries where harmonized biosafety management system is still under-developing.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Xiaoxia; Weng, Jingqing; Jiang, Zhenggang; Yan, Congcong; Gu, Hua","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be4cd88f0c458769a253ef97c5643ad4562bf48e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300485; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300485","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SINS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["occurrence of biosafety","harmonized biosafety management system","improvement of laboratory biosafety management","number of biosafety committees","SINS model system","number of biosafety laboratory managers","integrated laboratory biosafety management system","biosafety-related laws","significant number of biosafety level","BSL","successful implementation of SINS model","Zhejiang Province","harmonized management of biological risks","diverse laboratories","countries","increase","effective control of biological risks","infectious biological materials","related incidences","Standardization","studies of various types of pathogenic agents","Informatization","main effects","Normalization","initiative","regions","Systematization","China","regulations","real challenge","achievements","review"],"language":"en"},

The two pollutants\u2019 emissions were decomposed into output effects, structural effects, clean production effects, and pollution abatement effects. The results showed that China\u2019s industrial SO(2) discharge increased by 1.14 Mt during 2003\u20132014, and the contributions from the four effects were 23.17, \u2212 1.88, \u2212 3.80, and \u2212 16.36 Mt, respectively. Likewise, NO(x) discharge changed by \u2212 3.44 Mt over 2011\u20132014, and the corresponding contributions from the four effects were 2.97, \u2212 0.62, \u2212 1.84, and \u2212 3.95 Mt. Thus, the output effect was mainly responsible for the growth of the two discharges. The average annual contribution rates of SO(2) and NO(x) from output were 14.33 and 5.97%, respectively, but pollution abatement technology presented the most obvious mitigating effects (\u2212 10.11 and \u2212 7.92%), followed by the mitigating effects of clean production technology (\u2212 2.35 and \u2212 3.7%), and the mitigation from the structural effect was the weakest (\u2212 1.16 and \u2212 1.25%, respectively), which meant pollutant reduction policies related to industrial structure adjustment should be a long-term measure for the two discharges. In addition, the sub-sectors of I20 (manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical products), I24 (manufacture of non-metallic mineral products), and I26 (smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals) were the major contributors to both discharges. Thus, these sub-sectors should be given priority consideration when designing mitigation-related measures. Last, some particular policy implications were recommended for reducing the two discharges, including that the government should seek a technological discharge reduction route.

Remarkably, RNA cap modification also contributes to mammalian cell host defense as viral RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation is sensed and inhibited by IFIT1, an interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG). Accordingly, pathogenic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved mechanisms to circumvent IFIT1 restriction and facilitate infection of mammalian cells. These include: (a) generating cap 1 structures on their RNA through cap-snatching or virally-encoded 2\u2032-O methyltransferases, (b) using cap-independent means of translation, or (c) using RNA secondary structural motifs to antagonize IFIT1 binding.

We have cloned, expressed, and purified a Strep-fused recombinant MERS-CoV nonstructural protein 13 (M-nsp13) helicase. Characterization of its biochemical properties showed that it unwound DNA and RNA similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV nsp13 (S-nsp13) helicase. We showed that M-nsp13 unwound in a 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction and efficiently unwound the partially duplex RNA substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the RNA substrates with a short or no loading strand. Moreover, the K(m) of ATP for M-nsp13 is inversely proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrates. Finally, we also showed that the rate of unwinding (ku) of M-nsp13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrate. These results provide insights that enhance our understanding of the biochemical properties of M-nsp13. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are known to cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and the United States of America. Helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the processive separation of double-stranded nucleic acids into two single-stranded nucleic acids by utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. MERS-CoV helicase is one of the most important viral replication enzymes of this coronavirus. Herein, we report the first bacterial expression, enzyme purification, and biochemical characterization of MERS-CoV helicase. The knowledge obtained from this study might be used to identify an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication, and the helicase might be used as a therapeutic target.","publish_time":"2016-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adedeji, Adeyemi O.; Lazarus, Hilary","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9ecb8e78616bebdb37e3b3b689ad60bafd922e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5014916.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00235-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27631026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ATP"],"locations":["Middle East","Europe","North Africa","United States of America"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV helicase","CoV replication","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV nsp13","S-nsp13","biochemical characterization of MERS","duplex RNA substrates","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","inhibitor of MERS","recombinant MERS-CoV nonstructural protein","long loading strand relative","novel coronavirus","biochemical properties","humans","nucleic acids","length","ATP hydrolysis","important viral replication enzymes","North Africa","enzyme purification","processive separation of double","Europe","DNA","superfamily","motor proteins","wide range of diseases","understanding","energy","bacterial expression","United States of America","animals","ku","conserved motifs","rate of unwinding","results","insights","Helicases","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","therapeutic target","knowledge","study","direction"],"language":"en"},

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan.

However, the systematic workflow evaluation on clinical respiratory samples and implementation of quality controls (QCs) is still lacking. A total of 3 QCs were implemented and processed through the whole mNGS workflow: a notemplate-control to evaluate contamination issues during the process; an internal and an external QC to check the integrity of the reagents, equipment, the presence of inhibitors, and to allow the validation of results for each sample. The workflow was then evaluated on 37 clinical respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory infections previously tested for a broad panel of viruses using semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays (28 positive samples including 6 multiple viral infections; 9 negative samples). Selected specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 20), aspirates (n = 10), or sputums (n = 7). The optimal spiking level of the internal QC was first determined in order to be sufficiently detected without overconsumption of sequencing reads. According to QC validation criteria, mNGS results were validated for 34/37 selected samples. For valid samples, viral genotypes were accurately determined for 36/36 viruses detected with PCR (viral genome coverage ranged from 0.6% to 100%, median = 67.7%). This mNGS workflow allowed the detection of DNA and RNA viruses up to a semi-quantitative PCR Ct value of 36. The six multiple viral infections involving 2 to 4 viruses were also fully characterized. A strong correlation between results of mNGS and real-time PCR was obtained for each type of viral genome (R2 ranged from 0.72 for linear single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses to 0.98 for linear ssDNA viruses). Although the potential of mNGS technology is very promising, further evaluation studies are urgently needed for its routine clinical use within a reasonable timeframe. The approach described herein is crucial to bring standardization and to ensure the quality of the generated sequences in clinical setting. We provide an easy-to-use single protocol successfully evaluated for the characterization of a broad and representative panel of DNA and RNA respiratory viruses in various types of clinical samples.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bal, A.; Pichon, M.; Picard, C.; Casalegno, JS.; Valette, M.; Schuffenecker, I.; Billard, L.; Vallet, S.; Vilchez, G.; Cheynet, V.; Oriol, G.; Assant, S.; Gillet, Y.; Lina, B.; Brengel-Pesce, K.; Morfin, F.; Josset, L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/487705d4d018a2e5c0c8c40cf7ec1e4a86f46aee.json; document_parses/pdf_json/22264c65eb6c14ba96287ba4da536424dd083253.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/367367","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["QC"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical respiratory samples","RNA viruses","mNGS workflow","RNA respiratory viruses","selected samples","mNGS results","results of mNGS","positive samples","negative samples","valid samples","broad panel of viruses","various types of clinical samples","linear ssDNA viruses","multiple viral infections","clinical setting","viral genotypes","acute respiratory infections","type of viral genome","potential of mNGS technology","viral genome coverage","internal QC","validation of results","routine clinical use","systematic workflow evaluation","semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays","semi-quantitative PCR Ct value","external QC","QC validation criteria","QCs","representative panel of DNA","detection of DNA","evaluation studies","Generation Sequencing","Selected specimens","implementation of quality controls","easy-to-use single protocol","overconsumption of sequencing reads","patients","characterization","metagenomic","notemplate-control","R2","contamination issues","equipment","accurate assumption-free virological diagnosis","process","integrity","reasonable timeframe","nasopharyngeal swabs","optimal spiking level","generated sequences","recent years","strong correlation","reagents","presence of inhibitors","order","standardization","aspirates","sputums","approach","total"],"language":"en"},

The evolutionary mechanisms governing the persistence and emergence of new norovirus strains in human populations are unknown. Primarily organized by sequence homology into two major human genogroups defined by multiple genoclusters, the majority of norovirus outbreaks are caused by viruses from the GII.4 genocluster, which was first recognized as the major epidemic strain in the mid-1990s. Previous studies by our laboratory and others indicate that some noroviruses readily infect individuals who carry a gene encoding a functional alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT2) and are designated \u201Csecretor-positive\u201D to indicate that they express ABH histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), a highly heterogeneous group of related carbohydrates on mucosal surfaces. Individuals with defects in the FUT2 gene are termed secretor-negative, do not express the appropriate HBGA necessary for docking, and are resistant to Norwalk infection. These data argue that FUT2 and other genes encoding enzymes that regulate processing of the HBGA carbohydrates function as susceptibility alleles. However, secretor-negative individuals can be infected with other norovirus strains, and reinfection with the GII.4 strains is common in human populations. In this article, we analyze molecular mechanisms governing GII.4 epidemiology, susceptibility, and persistence in human populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Phylogenetic analyses of the GII.4 capsid sequences suggested an epochal evolution over the last 20 y with periods of stasis followed by rapid evolution of novel epidemic strains. The epidemic strains show a linear relationship in time, whereby serial replacements emerge from the previous cluster. Five major evolutionary clusters were identified, and representative ORF2 capsid genes for each cluster were expressed as virus-like particles (VLPs). Using salivary and carbohydrate-binding assays, we showed that GII.4 VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding patterns have changed over time and include carbohydrates regulated by the human FUT2 and FUT3 pathways, suggesting that strain sensitivity to human susceptibility alleles will vary. Variation in surface-exposed residues and in residues that surround the fucose ligand interaction domain suggests that antigenic drift may promote GII.4 persistence in human populations. Evidence supporting antigenic drift was obtained by measuring the antigenic relatedness of GII.4 VLPs using murine and human sera and demonstrating strain-specific serologic and carbohydrate-binding blockade responses. These data suggest that the GII.4 noroviruses persist by altering their HBGA carbohydrate-binding targets over time, which not only allows for escape from highly penetrant host susceptibility alleles, but simultaneously allows for immune-driven selection in the receptor-binding region to facilitate escape from protective herd immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the surface-exposed carbohydrate ligand binding domain in the norovirus capsid is under heavy immune selection and likely evolves by antigenic drift in the face of human herd immunity. Variation in the capsid carbohydrate-binding domain is tolerated because of the large repertoire of similar, yet distinct HBGA carbohydrate receptors available on mucosal surfaces that could interface with the remodeled architecture of the capsid ligand-binding pocket. The continuing evolution of new replacement strains suggests that, as with influenza viruses, vaccines could be targeted that protect against norovirus infections, and that continued epidemiologic surveillance and reformulations of norovirus vaccines will be essential in the control of future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2008-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindesmith, Lisa C; Donaldson, Eric F; LoBue, Anna D; Cannon, Jennifer L; Zheng, Du-Ping; Vinje, Jan; Baric, Ralph S","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d0ae9643da1b47c2234dd758a36ed3c3abc1aa2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cc724dd07268172a4d5b9d83df29fe32757dee98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2235898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18271619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABH","HBGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human FUT2","human populations","capsid carbohydrate-binding domain","norovirus capsid","carbohydrate-binding assays","human susceptibility alleles","HBGA carbohydrate-binding targets","human sera","capsid ligand-binding pocket","surface-exposed carbohydrate ligand binding domain","major human genogroups","antigenic relatedness of GII","carbohydrate-binding blockade responses","VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding patterns","emergence of new norovirus strains","norovirus infections","antigenic drift","face of human herd immunity","epidemic outbreaks","receptor-binding region","majority of norovirus outbreaks","major epidemic strain","reformulations of norovirus vaccines","capsid sequences","persistence","rapid evolution of novel epidemic strains","time","FUT2 gene","Noroviruses","data","distinct HBGA carbohydrate receptors available","HBGA carbohydrates function","secretor-negative individuals","continuing evolution of new replacement strains","fucose ligand interaction domain","representative ORF2 capsid genes","penetrant host susceptibility alleles","mucosal surfaces","strain sensitivity","appropriate HBGA necessary","escape","surface-exposed residues","epochal evolution","VLPs","major evolutionary clusters","previous cluster","termed secretor-negative","evolutionary mechanisms","Variation","secretor-positive","heterogeneous group of related carbohydrates","strain-specific serologic","immune-driven selection","heavy immune selection","protective herd immunity","control of future outbreaks","molecular mechanisms","influenza viruses","Previous studies","assisted living communities","ABH histo-blood group antigens","multiple genoclusters","hospitals","HBGAs","humans","military","leading cause of viral acute gastroenteritis","cruise ships","serial replacements","epidemiologic surveillance","linear relationship","large repertoire of similar","docking","processing","FUT3 pathways","epidemiology","periods of stasis","Phylogenetic analyses","FINDINGS","sequence homology","defects","enzymes","remodeled architecture","reinfection","functional alpha","METHODS","BACKGROUND","fucosyltransferase","laboratory","Norwalk infection","particles","Evidence","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Most pacemakers are implanted transvenously, using endocardial leads, but rarely epicardial leads may be necessary. To decide whether a patient is a candidate for pacing, as well as which pacing modality should be used, the clinician must have a clear understanding of the etiology, the pathophysiology, and the natural history of the most common bradyarrhythmias, as well as what result can be achieved by pacing patients with different rhythm disturbances. The goal of this review was, therefore, to describe the indications for pacing by evaluating the available evidence in both human and veterinary medicine. We described the etiology of bradyarrhythmias, clinical signs and electrocardiographic abnormalities, and the choice of pacing modality, taking into account how different choices may have different physiological consequences to selected patients.

Natural killer (NK) cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and are not static but populate secondary and primary lymphoid organs. A unique feature of NK cells is their expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, which allow them to respond either when ligands for activating receptors are upregulated or when ligands for inhibitory receptors are downregulated. The unique transcriptome of NK cells renders them capable of protecting the host from a vast array of disease states. Their undisputed importance in host protection is conferred by their ability to eliminate unhealthy cells. However, in order for NK cells to exert their effects, they need to be strategically located at the right places. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and pathological conditions. NK cells develop in the BM, which they exit using specific molecular interactions. Exit from the BM is followed by localization to a number of tissues, including secondary lymphoid organs. Within each tissue, NK cells often acquire unique function and phenotype that is regulated by the local microenvironment. Their localization is primarily directed by the action of chemokines and therefore is in tight association with the activation status of the organism. Changes in chemokine expression during disease results in further NK cell mobilization and allows them to protect the host from infection and malignancy. Thus, from their time of production until their end, NK cells travel exhaustively over long distances and visit places that influence their already dynamic life.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bekiaris, Vasileios; Lane, Peter J.L.","journal":"Natural Killer Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c68359663839ec2357676e09ca01836bff45eaa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150348.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704542000107; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704542000107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Publisher Summary Natural","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unique transcriptome of NK cells","unique feature of NK cells","unhealthy cells","NK cell mobilization","localization of NK cell populations","BM","inhibitory receptors","chemokine expression","ability","secondary lymphoid organs","unique function","host protection","ligands","primary lymphoid organs","disease results","distinctive gene expression patterns","Publisher Summary Natural killer","right places","vast array of disease states","finite lymphocyte lineage","current understanding","number of tissues","activation status","tight association","response","Changes","phenotype","end","long distances","bone marrow","pathological conditions","overview","undisputed importance","time of production","action of chemokines","specific molecular interactions","organism","chapter","dynamic life","infection","malignancy","order","effects","local microenvironment"],"language":"en"},

There was evidence of reinfection of camels that were previously seropositive, thus suggesting that prior infection does not provide complete immunity from reinfection, a finding that is relevant to camel vaccination strategies as a means to prevent zoonotic transmission.","publish_time":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Alnaeem, Abdulmohsen; Chu, Daniel KW; Perera, Ranawaka APM; Chan, Samuel MS; Almathen, Faisal; Yau, Emily; Ng, Brian CY; Webby, Richard J; Poon, Leo LM; Peiris, Malik","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac14fff2effb225af96af173c6035a28b34fb507.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5520318.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nasal swabs","Evidence of MERS","evidence of reinfection","herds of dromedary camels","coronavirus RNA","rectal swabs","prior infection","CoV infection","single virus","finding","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","significant increases","means","camel vaccination strategies","complete immunity","basis of detection","antibody titers","samples","introduction","serum","antibodies","zoonotic transmission","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, outbreak forecasting requires an integrative approach to modeling. While specific components of outbreaks are predictable, it remains unclear whether fundamental limits to outbreak prediction exist. Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scarpino, Samuel V.; Petri, Giovanni","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ce2d071c2152f86f8f190bb30ea857f16050ae8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6385200.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08616-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease time series","Infectious disease outbreaks","time scale of single outbreaks","model independent measure of predictability","model structures","model selection","fundamental entropy barrier","long time series","diverse collection of outbreaks","specific components of outbreaks","outbreak prediction","outbreak forecasting","predictability of complex adaptive systems","likely mechanisms","fundamental limits","implying prediction","permutation entropy","dynamic modeling approaches","social network heterogeneity","challenges","pathogens","differences","multi-level interaction of hosts","importance","integrative approach","biology","results","environment","forecast horizons"],"language":"en"},

Only three RVA strains have been reported in bats in Kenya (straw-colored fruit bat) and in China (lesser horseshoe and a stoliczka\u2019s trident bat), being highly divergent from each other. To further elucidate the potential of bat RVAs to cause gastroenteritis in humans we started by investigating the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using metagenomics. Five samples contained significant numbers of RVA Illumina reads, sufficient to obtain their (near) complete genomes. A single RVA strain showed a close phylogenetic relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain in six gene segments, including VP7 (G25), whereas the other gene segments represented novel genotypes as ratified by the RCWG. The 4 other RVA strains were highly divergent from known strains (but very similar among each other) possessing all novel genotypes. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed a significant variability representing multiple novel G and P genotypes, indicating the frequent occurrence of reassortment events. Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that several of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel VP6 based screening primers matching both human and bat RVAs were developed and used to screen samples from 25 infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population. Although RVA infections were identified in 36% of the infants, Sanger sequencing did not indicate evidence of interspecies transmissions. This study identified multiple novel bat RVA strains, but further epidemiological studies in humans will have to assess if these viruses have the potential to cause gastroenteritis in humans.","publish_time":"2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yinda, Claude Kwe; Zeller, Mark; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Maes, Piet; Deboutte, Ward; Beller, Leen; Heylen, Elisabeth; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Ranst, Marc Van; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1b26388670660f66249b55ece2beccee4c18d1a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/453c3865f258ef59869149ea1802228d23c568b5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/054072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["RVA","RVA Illumina","RCWG"],"locations":["China","Cameroon","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["multiple novel bat RVA strains","bat viruses","Kenyan bat RVA strain","RVA infections","humans","potential of bat RVAs","human RVA screening primers","novel genotypes","novel VP7","single RVA strain","gastroenteritis","known strains","stoliczka\u2019s trident bat","studied bat population","significant numbers of RVA Illumina","novel VP6","multiple novel G","gene segments","VP4 segments","straw-colored fruit bats","close contact","close proximity","fecal samples","P genotypes","routine epidemiological screening studies","epidemiological studies","hemorrhagic viruses","infants","close phylogenetic relationship","genetic diversity of RVAs","significant variability","VP4 genes","China","important reservoir","lesser horseshoe","study","frequent occurrence of reassortment events","Cameroon","G25","rotavirus","Sanger sequencing","evidence of interspecies transmissions","metagenomics","RCWG","complete genomes"],"language":"en"},

(2) Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments from MHV-JHM-infected cells revealed that the same polypeptide chain was recognized by the anti-E2 mab and by the anti-Fc\u03B3R mab 2.41G2. (3) Actinomycin D did not influence the induction and expression of the 180,000-Da polypeptide chain that was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Fc\u03B3R mab, demonstrating that this protein is of viral origin.","publish_time":"1990-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oleszak, Emilia L.; Leibowitz, Julian L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f98b25888658385f928bee2a94937345e144327.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090231F; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090231F","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rabbit IgG"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-infected cells","MHV-JHM E2","anti-E2 mab","anti-Fc\u03B3R mab","anti-E2 antibodies","uninfected cells","anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody","rat anti-mouse Fc\u03B3R monoclonal antibody","anti-mouse FcyR monoclonal antibody","MHV-A59","E2 glycoprotein","anti Fc\u03B3R mab","mouse monoclonal antibodies","c brain cells","monoclonal mouse IgG2a","surface peplomer protein E2","proteins","MHV-induced cell fusion","monoclonal rat IgG1","molecular mimicry","molecular mass identical","molecular weight identical","infected cultures of neonatal BALB","polypeptide chain","eliciting neutralizing antibody","IgG2b","unrelated rat","host cell","cell line","uninfected WEHI","fragments of rabbit IgG","escape of virus","goat antiserum","normal goat serum","Staphylococcus aureus V","Partial proteolytic maps","Fc \u03B3 receptor","destruction","murine coronaviruses","protease treatment","Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments","Abstract Antigenic variation","attachment","Dal","immunological mechanisms","induction","molecule","Actinomycin D","expression","lines of evidence","viral origin","41G2"],"language":"en"},

We further showed that M protein-induced apoptosis involved mitochondrial release of cytochrome c protein, and could be suppressed by caspase inhibitors. Over-expression of M caused a dominant rough-eye phenotype in adult Drosophila. By performing a forward genetic modifier screen, we identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) as a dominant suppressor of M-induced apoptotic cell death.

HCV capsid (core) protein (HCVcp) is a highly demanded antigen for various diagnostic, immunization and pathogenesis studies. Plants are considered as an expression system for producing safe and inexpensive biopharmaceutical proteins. Although invention of transgenic (stable) tobacco plants expressing HCVcp with proper antigenic properties was recently reported, no data for \u201Ctransient-expression\u201D that is currently the method of choice for rapid, simple and lower-priced protein expression in plants is available for HCVcp. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to design a highly codon-optimized HCVcp gene for construction of an efficient transient-plant expression system for production of HCVcp with proper antigenic properties in a regional tobacco plant (Iranian Jafarabadi-cultivar) by evaluation of different classes of vectors and suppression of gene-silencing in tobacco. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A codon-optimized gene encoding the Kozak sequence, 6xHis-tag, HCVcp (1-122) and KDEL peptide in tandem (from N- to C-terminal) was designed and inserted into potato virus-X (PVX) and classic pBI121 binary vectors in separate cloning reactions. The resulted recombinant plasmids were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and vacuum infiltrated into tobacco leaves. The effect of gene silencing suppressor P19 protein derived from tomato bushy stunt virus on the expression yield of HCVcp by each construct was also evaluated by co-infiltration in separate groups. The expressed HCVcp was evaluated by dot and western blotting and ELISA assays. RESULTS: The codon-optimized gene had an increased adaptation index value (from 0.65 to 0.85) and reduced GC content (from 62.62 to 51.05) in tobacco and removed the possible deleterious effect of \u201CGGTAAG\u201D splice site in native HCVcp. Blotting assays via specific antibodies confirmed the expression of the 15 kDa HCVcp. The expression level of HCVcp was enhanced by 4-5 times in P19 co-agroinfiltrated plants with better outcomes for PVX, compared to pBI121 vector (0.022% versus 0.019% of the total soluble protein). The plant-derived HCVcp (pHCVcp) could properly identify the HCVcp antibody in HCV-infected human sera compared to Escherichia coli-derived HCVcp (eHCVcp), indicating its potential for diagnostic/immunization applications. CONCLUSIONS: By employment of gene optimization strategies, use of viral-based vectors and suppression of plant-derived gene silencing effect, efficient transient expression of HCVcp in tobacco with proper antigenic properties could be possible.","publish_time":"2014-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadzadeh, Sara; Khabiri, Alireza; Roohvand, Farzin; Memarnejadian, Arash; Salmanian, Ali Hatef; Ajdary, Soheila; Ehsani, Parastoo","journal":"Hepat Mon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9fc9152d225265c48f4b8023ffab0a26de38132.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4286711.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5812/hepatmon.20524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25598788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression yield of HCVcp","expression level of HCVcp","production of HCVcp","HCVcp antibody","native HCVcp","expressed HCVcp","kDa HCVcp","plant-derived HCVcp","efficient transient expression of HCVcp","codon-optimized HCVcp gene","transient-expression","Escherichia coli-derived HCVcp","tobacco plants","suppression of gene","codon-optimized gene","derived gene silencing effect","efficient transient-plant expression system","regional tobacco plant","lower-priced protein expression","tobacco leaves","effect of gene silencing suppressor P19 protein","suppression of plant","proper antigenic properties","employment of gene optimization strategies","P19 co-agroinfiltrated plants","PVX","possible deleterious effect","HCV capsid","Hepatitis C virus","total soluble protein","Blotting assays","classic pBI121 binary vectors","viral-based vectors","potato virus-X","tomato bushy stunt virus","HCV-infected human sera","evaluation of different classes of vectors","various diagnostic","co-infiltration","pBI121 vector","immunization applications","separate groups","ELISA assays","western blotting","C-terminal","separate cloning reactions","GGTAAG","construction","better outcomes","Iranian Jafarabadi-cultivar","dot","major cause of liver cirrhosis","splice site","Kozak sequence","Agrobacterium","increased adaptation index value","eHCVcp","demanded antigen","humans","tandem","method of choice","inexpensive biopharmaceutical proteins","potential","pathogenesis studies","xHis-tag","times","BACKGROUND","specific antibodies","METHODS","core","pHCVcp","invention of transgenic","resulted recombinant plasmids","KDEL peptide","study","vacuum","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","data","reduced GC content","OBJECTIVES","purpose","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide \u201Cslip-site\u201D and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.","publish_time":"1991-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Ian; Rolley, Nicola J.; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21d2a4fc141bfe400dda7eda59f19c34480365a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283691903619; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0022283691903619","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pseudoknot structure","pseudoknot stems","RNA pseudoknot","pseudoknot loops","efficient frameshifting","functional structure","frameshifting properties","abolished frameshifting","series of pseudoknot mutants","overall structure","simple stem-loop structure","downstream tertiary RNA structure","frameshift process","stacked stems","base-paired stem","efficient ribosomal frameshift signal","base-pair formation","length","genomic RNA","single base-pair contact","predicted functional minimum","coronavirus IBV","nucleotides","junction","region","nucleotide composition","overlapping","current building rules","removal","pre-requisite","particular conformational feature","contribution","primary sequence determinants","b open reading frames","close proximity","small insertions","ability","deletion","large insertion","heptanucleotide","elements","results"],"language":"en"},

CypA acts as a key factor in the replication of several viruses. However, little is known about the role of CypA in the replication of the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV). In the present report, grouper CypA (GF-CypA) was cloned from the grouper fin cell line (GF-1) derived from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Sequence analysis found that GF-CypA open reading frame (ORF) of 495 bp encodes a polypeptide of 164 amino acids residues with a molecular weight of 17.4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highly conserved regions with CypA of other animal species, showing that GF-CypA is a new member of Cyclophilin A family. We observed that GF-CypA was up-regulated in the GF-1 cells infected with RGNNV. Additionally, overexpression of CypA could significantly inhibit the replication of RGNNV in GF-1 cells. By contrast, when the GF-CypA was knock-downed by siRNA in GF-1 cells, the replication of RGNNV was enhanced. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1b, and ISG-15, were increased in GF-CypA transfected GF-1 cells challenged with RGNNV, indicating that GF-CypA might be involved in the regulation of the host pro-inflammatory factors. Altogether, we conclude that GF-CypA plays a vital role in the inhibitory effect of RGNNV replication that might be modulating the cytokines secretion in GF-1 cells during RGNNV infection. These results will shed new light on the function of CypA in the replication of RGNNV and will pave a new way for the prevention of the infection of RGNNV in fish.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asim, Muhammad; Sarath Babu, V.; Qin, Zhendong; Zhao, Lijuan; Su, Jianguo; Li, Jun; Tu, Jiagang; Kou, Hongyan; Lin, Li","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bb8a769b958a1c01cb14e06a03df137b037d76b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111709.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464819306394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176008/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.05.064; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464819306394","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GF-CypA transfected GF","grouper CypA","role of CypA","function of CypA","CypA acts","overexpression of CypA","replication of RGNNV","GF-CypA open reading frame","RGNNV infection","infection of RGNNV","cells","inhibitory effect of RGNNV replication","orange-spotted grouper","new light","new way","new member of Cyclophilin","grouper fin cell line","host pro-inflammatory factors","expressions of pro-inflammatory factors","red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","deduced amino acid sequence","Sequence analysis","vital role","TNF-\u03B1","Abstract Cyclophilin","amino acids residues","conserved regions","diverse pathological conditions","molecular weight","ORF","regulation","animal species","key factor","polypeptide","bp","cellular protein","Epinephelus coioides","prevention","present report","cytokines secretion","inflammation","family","siRNA","ISG","kDa","results","viruses","fish","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to compare the chemokine production induced by HRVs in airway epithelial cells with that induced by other respiratory viruses, and to investigate synergistic interactions between HRVs and HDMs on the induction of inflammatory chemokines in vitro. METHODS: A549 human airway epithelial cells were infected with either rhinovirus serotype 7, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A2 strain, or adenovirus serotype 3 and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-8 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) release and mRNA expression. Additionally, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB and activator protein (AP)-1 were evaluated. The release of IL-8 and RANTES was also measured in cells stimulated simultaneously with a virus and the HDM allergen, Der f1. RESULTS: HRV caused greater IL-8 and RANTES release and mRNA expression compared with either RSV or adenovirus. NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 were activated in these processes. Cells incubated with a virus and Der f1 showed an increased IL-8 release. However, compared with cells incubated with virus alone as the stimulator, only HRV with Der f1 showed a statistically significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and RANTES were induced to a greater extent by HRV compared with other viruses, and only HRV with Der f1 acted synergistically to induce bronchial epithelial IL-8 release. These findings may correspond with the fact that rhinoviruses are identified more frequently than other viruses in cases of acute exacerbation of asthma.","publish_time":"2013-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chun, Yoon Hong; Park, Ju Young; Lee, Huisu; Kim, Hyun Sook; Won, Sulmui; Joe, Hyun Jung; Chung, Woo Jin; Yoon, Jong-seo; Kim, Hyun Hee; Kim, Jin Tack; Lee, Joon Sung","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e11faf6356de98196a3566fa0755f178909b256d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3695236.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2013.5.4.216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Der f1"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["release of IL","RANTES release","f1","greater IL","increased IL","bronchial epithelial IL","HRVs","A549 human airway epithelial cells","respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","HDMs","NF-\u03BAB","RSV","mRNA expression","adenovirus serotype","AP","rhinovirus serotype","environmental factors human rhinoviruses","cases of acute exacerbation of asthma","greater extent","common causes of acute exacerbations of asthma","activation of nuclear factor","A2 strain","house dust mites","METHODS","chemokine production","synergistic interactions","normal T-cell","PURPOSE","activator protein","induction of inflammatory chemokines","study","HDM allergen","interleukin","RESULTS","stimulator","significant increase","CONCLUSIONS","findings","aim","processes"],"language":"en"},

The scheme operates as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants will be expelled from public housing if they receive sixteen points for the misdeeds they have committed.

RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2\u20137) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12\u201320) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8\u201311 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P \u003C0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10\u201312 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P \u003C0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.

Induction of in vitro antibody synthesis was analyzed. The purified recombinant viral proteins induced the in vitro synthesis of neutralizing TGEV-specific antibodies when porcine TGEV-immune cells were stimulated with each of the combinations made with two of the major structural proteins: S\u002BN, S\u002BM, and to a minor extent with M\u002BN, but not by the individual proteins. S-protein was dissociated from purified virus using NP-40 detergent and then micellar S-protein oligomers (S-rosettes) were formed by removing the detergent. These occurred preferentially by the association of more than 10 S-protein trimmers. These S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins elicited TGEV-specific antibodies with titers up to 84 and 60%, respectively, of those induced by the whole virus. N-protein could be partially substituted by a 15-mer peptide that represents a T helper epitope previously identified in N-protein (Ant\u00F3n et al. (1995)).

DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have become hot topics in recent studies which both served as cell adhesion and phagocytic pathogen recognition receptors in mammals. However, there have been almost no studies of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN structure and characters in fish, only DC-SIGN in the zebrafish had been studied. In our study, we identified and characterized the full-length miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) DC-SIGN (mmDC-SIGN) and L-SIGN (mmL-SIGN) genes. The sequence analysis results showed that mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN have the same domains with other vertebrates except primates, and share some conserved motifs in CRD among all the vertebrates which play a crucial role in interacting with Ca(2\u002B) and for recognizing mannose-containing motifs. Gene synteny of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were analyzed for the first time and gene synteny of L-SIGN was conserved among the five fishes. Interestingly, one gene next to L-SIGN from gene synteny had high similarity with L-SIGN gene that was described as L-SIGN-like in fish species. While only one L-SIGN gene existed in other vertebrates, two L-SIGN in fish may be in consequence of the fish-specific genome duplication to adapt the specific environment. The evolutionary analysis showed that the ancestral lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes experienced purifying selection and the current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent positive selection, indicating that the ancestral lineages and current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent different evolutionary patterns. Both mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN were expressed in all tested tissues and ubiquitously up-regulated in infected liver, spleen and kidney at different sampling time points, indicating that the mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN participated in the immune response to defense against bacteria infection.","publish_time":"2015-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Chang; Wang, Shanchen; Xu, Tianjun","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab7c5bbcff6f13e19d69ea09e776cb830dedaf90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124703.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596146/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X15000051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X15000051; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2015.01.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIGN gene","mmDC-SIGN","mmL-SIGN","SIGN structure","Gene synteny of DC","studies of DC","homologues of DC","current lineages","ancestral lineages","vertebrates","specific environment","fish-specific genome duplication","fish species","Dendritic cell-specific ICAM","fishes experienced purifying selection","lymph node-specific ICAM","non-integrin","evolutionary analysis","conserved motifs","different evolutionary patterns","Miichthys miiuy","positive selection","cell adhesion","different sampling time points","immune response","infected liver","recent studies","full-length miiuy croaker","innate immune system","sequence analysis results","phagocytic pathogen recognition receptors","C-type lectin receptors family","kidney","important members","key molecules","spleen","CD209","high similarity","pathogens","consequence","defense","bacteria infection","mammals","primates","hot topics","domains","CD299","characters","crucial role","CRD","genes","recognizing mannose","tested tissues","zebrafish","study"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination of pregnant sows with live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) is the most effective strategy to induce lactogenic immunity in the sows, which provides A passive protection of suckling piglets against PEDV via the colostrum (beestings, or first milk) and milk. Several LAV candidates have been developed via serially passaging the highly virulent PEDV isolates in non-porcine Vero cells. However, their efficacies in the induction of sufficient protection against virulent PEDV challenge vary in vivo. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the virulence-related mutations of PEDV and their potential roles in PEDV attenuation in vivo. With the successful development of reverse genetics systems for PEDV, we also discuss how to use them to generate promising LAV candidates that are safe, effective and genetically stable.

DESIGN Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.

Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans. Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees, these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence. Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts. We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful. Despite this framework, we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the human\u2013animal interface and regions of ecological disturbance.","publish_time":"2017-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Open Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bed1c9834dbd81a9e254940379f80c3447a122e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5666085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070612/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.170189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of virus disease emergence","genetic aspects of virus emergence","successful emergence of new diseases","evolutionary time scales","processes of virus evolution","simple population genetic framework","epidemiological time scales","integrated view","short-term microevolutionary processes","regions of ecological disturbance","importance of host population size","enormous number of unsampled viruses","ongoing virological surveillance","animal interface","data","little predictive power","turn","family-scale phylogenetic trees","density","cross-species transmission","factors","major research topic","biomedicine","patterns","novel hosts","efforts","practical solution","humans"],"language":"en"},

RVs exacerbate chronic airway disease and confound the clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness. We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to breakdown RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections by comprehensive molecular testing of a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001. RVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype \u223C90% of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were under-represented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution. Notably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data. Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not the case. Nearly 80% of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect. For routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arden, Katherine E.; Greer, Ristan M.; Wang, Claire Y.T.; Mackay, Ian M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d47377d0da60ea7aab2522c204ad65753b0545fe.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b6bde9469ea1739569ed08a04fd345f295ddece6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/334334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV testing","RV detections","RV species seasonality","RV-Bs","RV circulation","RV species co-circulated","breakdown RV involvement","spectrum of RV diversity","distinct RVs","respiratory virus co-detections","routine respiratory virus screening","common virus","acute respiratory illness","suspected respiratory infections","comprehensive molecular testing","chronic airway disease","IFAV season","convenience collection of airway sample extracts","clinical diagnosis of influenza","putative protective effect","patients","principal component","times","non-specific antiviral intervention","primary pathogens","roles","algorithm","population-level interference","year","ill infants","people","aspects","findings","bimodal distribution","frequent perception","symptoms","case","Rhinoviruses","data"],"language":"en"},

Only a few centers however, are equipped with the available resources and equipment to perform these tests. We describe our experience in HVMA reaching-out to many more peripheral and relatively remote areas. A portable computer with HVMA software, video camera and a microscope were used. Fourteen disperse pediatric centers were reached and a total of 203 subjects were tested within a relatively short time (Clinical Trial Registration: NCT 01070914 (registered February 6, 2010). RESULTS: With an average time of 20 minutes per patient, the system enabled us to test approximately 10\u201315 subjects per day. A valid HVMA result was made in 148 subjects and helped in the diagnosis of PCD in many of the patients who were subsequently confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy and/or immunofluoresence and/or genetics and/or nasal Nitric Oxide testing. The sensitivity of abnormal HVMA to accurately predict PCD was 90.2%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This is the first report of an out-reach system to record HVMA for improved diagnosis of PCD in remote regions that are not within reach of PCD centers and experts.

Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) expression is an important susceptibility factor for HuNoV infection based on controlled human infection models and epidemiologic studies that show an association of secretor status with infection caused by several genotypes. The fucosyltransferase 2 gene (FUT2) affects HBGA expression in intestinal epithelial cells; secretors express a functional FUT2 enzyme, while nonsecretors lack this enzyme and are highly resistant to infection and gastroenteritis caused by many HuNoV strains. These epidemiologic associations are confirmed by infections in stem cell-derived human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures. GII.4 HuNoV does not replicate in HIE cultures derived from nonsecretor individuals, while HIEs from secretors are permissive to infection. However, whether FUT2 expression alone is critical for infection remains unproven, since routinely used secretor-positive transformed cell lines are resistant to HuNoV replication. To evaluate the role of FUT2 in HuNoV replication, we used CRISPR or overexpression to genetically manipulate FUT2 gene function to produce isogenic HIE lines with or without FUT2 expression. We show that FUT2 expression alone affects both HuNoV binding to the HIE cell surface and susceptibility to HuNoV infection. These findings indicate that initial binding to a molecule(s) glycosylated by FUT2 is critical for HuNoV infection and that the HuNoV receptor is present in nonsecretor HIEs. In addition to HuNoV studies, these isogenic HIE lines will be useful tools to study other enteric microbes where infection and/or disease outcome is associated with secretor status.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haga, Kei; Ettayebi, Khalil; Tenge, Victoria R.; Karandikar, Umesh C.; Lewis, Miranda A.; Lin, Shih-Ching; Neill, Frederick H.; Ayyar, B.

Automatic thesaurus construction based on patterns was first suggested by Hearst [1], but it is still not clear how to automatically construct such patterns for different semantic relations and domains. In particular it is not certain which patterns are useful for capturing synonymy. The assumption of extant resources such as parsers is also a limiting factor for many languages, so it is desirable to find patterns that do not use syntactical analysis. Finally to give a more consistent and applicable result it is desirable to use these patterns to form synonym sets in a sound way. RESULTS: We present a method that automatically generates regular expression patterns by expanding seed patterns in a heuristic search and then develops a feature vector based on the occurrence of term pairs in each developed pattern. This allows for a binary classifications of term pairs as synonymous or non-synonymous. We then model this result as a probability graph to find synonym sets, which is equivalent to the well-studied problem of finding an optimal set cover. We achieved 73.2% precision and 29.7% recall by our method, out-performing hand-made resources such as MeSH and Wikipedia. CONCLUSION: We conclude that automatic methods can play a practical role in developing new thesauri or expanding on existing ones, and this can be done with only a small amount of training data and no need for resources such as parsers. We also concluded that the accuracy can be improved by grouping into synonym sets.","publish_time":"2008-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCrae, John; Collier, Nigel","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e1c072b035756104151484e6548cac0517cc5f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2335115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18366721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hearst"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seed patterns","regular expression patterns","synonym sets","parsers","occurrence of term pairs","assumption of extant resources","binary classifications of term pairs","new thesauri","automatic methods","applicable result","large number of thesauri","Automatic thesaurus construction","coverage","well-studied problem","practical role","biomedical domain","heuristic search","optimal set cover","feature vector","training data","different semantic relations","domains","need","probability graph","developed pattern","terms","variant forms","limiting factor","languages","existing ones","MeSH","hand","recall","CONCLUSION","sound way","Wikipedia","syntactical analysis","synonymy","precision","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Hearst","accuracy"],"language":"en"},

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host\u2019s immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-\u03BAB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-\u03BAB p65, p-I\u03BAB\u03B1 and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of I\u03BAB\u03B1. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-\u03BAB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Qinhai; Pan, Weiqi; Li, Runfeng; Liu, Bin; Li, Chufang; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Zhao, Jin; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Yang, Zifeng","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69382cbac0bbdd2437414b92b122815b44d4cf46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192119.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311580?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360580/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311580; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liu Shen"],"organizations":["LS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","antiviral activity of SARS","antiviral effect of LS","expression of p","inhibitory effect of LS","expression of I\u03BAB\u03B1","expression of inflammatory cytokines","IL","virus infection","specific antiviral treatment","p-I\u03BAB\u03B1","activity of NF","cytopathic effect","potential effect","NF-\u03BAB p65","p-p38 MAPK","Vero E6 cells","Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels","pathway","replication","number of virus particles","pro-inflammatory cytokines","promising candidate treatment","person contact","number of virions","mRNA levels","TNF-\u03B1","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","public health emergency of international concern","CPE","transmission electron microscope","plaque reduction assay","COVID","key proteins","wide spectrum of pharmacological properties","real-time quantitative PCR assays","host\u2019s immune response","Liu Shen capsule","traditional Chinese medicine","production","CCL","immunomodulatory activities","western blot","CXCL","IP","MCP","disease","present","findings","study","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia. RESULTS: With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirms the importance of continued and regular vaccination against FeLV among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors. Within the remit of this retrospective study, it was not possible to follow-up results of repeat testing or of other assays (PCR) of individual cats. As a result of this, no conclusions can be drawn as to the possibility of transient antigenaemic cats or false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results.","publish_time":"2015-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firth, Clair L; M\u00F6stl, Karin","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33842ff07428db8111b5c1aa9421d7272f523602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5362014.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116915598336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28491380/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Veterinary Medicine"],"locations":["Vienna","Austria"],"keyphrases":["Samples","proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats","owned cats","Austrian cats","prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia","level of FeLV antigenaemia","individual cats","Vienna","University of Veterinary Medicine","possibility of transient antigenaemic cats","regular vaccination","retrospective study","infection","CONCLUSIONS","follow-up results of repeat testing","eastern Austria","retrospective analysis","false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results","education of pet owners","seroprevalence of feline leukaemia virus","assays","age","importance of continued","animal welfare charities","PCR","Department of Clinical Virology","routine diagnostic procedures","surrounding area","effect of sex","aim","advances","symptomatic individuals","RELEVANCE","access","OBJECTIVES","period","remit","statistical comparison","respect","analyses of subgroups","outdoors","population","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) plays an important role in the innate and adaptive immune responses by inducing IFN-\u03B3. IL-18 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is an intrinsic inhibitor of IL-18 that possesses higher affinity to IL-18. In this study, we cloned and characterized IL-18BP in giant panda (AmIL-18BP) from the spleen. The amino acid sequence of giant panda IL-18BP ORF shared about 65% identities with other species. To evaluate the effects of AmIL-18BP on the immune responses, we expressed the recombinant AmIL-18BP in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3).The fusing protein PET-AmIL-18BP was purified by nickel affinity column chromatography. The biological function of purified PET-AmIL-18BP was determined on mice splenocyte by qRT-PCR. The results showed that AmIL-18BP was functional and could significantly reduce IFN-\u03B3 production in murine splenocytes. These results will facilitate the study of protecting giant panda on etiology and immunology.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Yue; Deng, Jiabo; Niu, Lili; Wang, Qiang; Yu, Jianqiu; Shao, Huanhuan; Cao, Qinghua; Zhang, Yizheng; Tan, Xuemei","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/994ceeb219cabcd4e005af795561c25dee600748.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234556/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528816300728; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528816300728; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2016.04.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BP ORF","characterized IL","recombinant AmIL","effects of AmIL","intrinsic inhibitor of IL","amino acid sequence of giant panda IL","fusing protein PET-AmIL","biological function of purified PET-AmIL","study","results","adaptive immune responses","IFN-\u03B3 production","binding protein","higher affinity","endangered species","nickel affinity column chromatography","DE3","Escherichia coli BL21","Ailuropoda melanoleuca","important role","murine splenocytes","mice splenocyte","etiology","qRT-PCR","identities","immunology","pathogenesis of various diseases","Interleukin","spleen"],"language":"en"},

Direct consequences of infections result in syndromes such as mononucleosis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, among other entities. Indirect consequences are mediated through cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors elaborated by the transplant recipient in response to microbial replication and invasion, which contribute to the net state of immunosuppression among other effects.

But one major inadequacy of this platform has been capturing the complexity of the cell membrane, including membrane proteins. Because of this, viruses requiring proteinaceous receptors, or other unknown cellular co-factors, have been precluded from study. Here we describe a general method to integrate proteinaceous receptors and cellular components into supported bilayers for SPT fusion studies. This method is general to any enveloped virus-host cell pair, but demonstrated here for feline coronavirus (FCoV). Supported bilayers are formed from mammalian cell membrane vesicles that express feline aminopeptidase N (the viral receptor) using a cell blebbing technique. SPT is then used to identify fusion intermediates and measure membrane fusion kinetics for FCoV. Overall, the fusion results recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors, a low-pH environment, and that membrane fusion is receptor- and protease-dependent. But this method also provides quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. Moreover, the platform offers versatile, precise control over the sequence of triggers for fusion; these triggers may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these triggers in this platform provides a new route to study how viruses rapidly adapt to other hosts, and to identify factors that led to the emergence of zoonotic viruses, such as human SARS-CoV and the newly emerging human MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2013-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costello, Deirdre A.; Millet, Jean K.; Hsia, Chih-Yun; Whittaker, Gary R.; Daniel, Susan","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/135895ffa21a3c75c822f185f2072ba8a224fbcb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3c3188a84fec1330bddb68d4db2e0f1bcb65ad56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111216.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961213007357; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961213007357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion intermediates","fusion results","SPT fusion studies","coronavirus fusion pathway","measure membrane fusion kinetics","host-pathogen membrane fusion studies","platform","membrane proteins","supported bilayers","mammalian cell membrane vesicles","proteinaceous receptors","feline coronavirus","general method","specific receptors","cell blebbing technique","sequence of triggers","coronavirus entry","FCoV","factors","study","enveloped virus-host cell pair","human SARS-CoV","emergence of zoonotic viruses","cellular components","viral receptor","emerging human MERS-CoV","feline aminopeptidase N","intermediate steps","microfluidics","quantitative kinetic rate parameters","single particle tracking","low-pH environment","binding","precise control","tissue tropism","Total internal reflection microscopy","new route","pathogenicity of coronaviruses","protease-dependent","complexity","major inadequacy","hosts","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia. Recently, the incidence of CCHF has increased rapidly in the countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR), with sporadic human cases and outbreaks of CCHF being reported from a number of countries in the region. Despite the rapidly growing incidence of the disease, there are currently no accurate data on the burden of the disease in the region due to the different surveillance systems used for CCHF in these countries. In an effort to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for the transmission of the CCHF virus (CCHFV; a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae) in the WHO EMR, and to identify the current knowledge gaps that are hindering effective control interventions, a sub-regional meeting was organized in Muscat, Oman, from December 7 to 9, 2015.

Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation has been established (S. Beushausenet al.(1987).J. Virol.61, 3795\u20133803). An inducer which accelerates maturation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also upregulates the expression of the regulatory subunit, R1 of PK1. Since (i) early block preventing infection of mature oligodendrocytes can be bypassed when transfection with genomic RNA is used and (ii) inhibitors of PKs counteract the dbcAMP effect, so as to alleviate the inhibition of JHMV, enhanced expression of R1 appeared to be connected with virus restriction. This idea was confirmed following upregulation of the R1 gene in fully permissive L-2 cells. There was a connection between an effect due to R1 and dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein N by an endosomal phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase) having the properties of types 1 or 2A enzyme which occurs during penetration of inoculum virions. An inhibitionin vitro(cell free) of N dephosphorylation by R1 together with evidence thatin vivo(cell culture) overexpression of R1 inhibited the endosomal PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome. Thus inhibition by R prevents uncoating and thereby interferes with the commencement of replication. These observations intimate the existence of a novel mechanism controlling a virus infection of specific cell target(s) undergoing a process of differentiation and maturation in the central nervous system.","publish_time":"1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalicharran, Kishna; Mohandas, Devaki; Wilson, Greame; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfc558a4241a48e116131d26ece914f715b53d10.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296905723; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296905723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["S.

Other ancillary diagnostic tests, including bacterial cultures, were performed on a case-by-case basis to rule in/out differential diagnoses based on initial clinicopathological presumptive diagnoses. BVDV-associated conditions that were diagnosed in the 8 cases included mucosal disease, transient postnatal BVDV infections associated with digestive/septicemic salmonellosis by Salmonella serovar typhimurium, Histophilus somni bronchopneumonia, urinary tract coinfections with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sp., enteric coinfection with coccidia, and transplacental fetal infections and abortions with Neospora caninum coinfection. BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b were each identified in four of the eight cases. We conclude that BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b contribute significantly to disease and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. Future research should estimate the economic impact of BVDV in the Uruguayan livestock sector.

Camels are reservoirs of this virus, and the virus spills over into humans through direct contact with camels. Human-to-human transmission and travel-associated cases have been identified as well. Limited studies have characterized the molecular pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Most studies have used ectopic expression of viral proteins to characterize MERS-CoV and its ability to modulate antiviral responses in human cells. Studies with live virus are limited, largely due to the requirement of high containment laboratories. In this review, we have summarized current studies on MERS-CoV molecular pathogenesis and have mentioned some recent strategies that are being developed to control MERS-CoV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple antiviral molecules with the potential to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by disrupting virus-receptor interactions are being developed and tested. Although human vaccine candidates are still being developed, a candidate camel vaccine is being tested for efficacy. Combination of supportive treatment with interferon and antivirals is also being explored. SUMMARY: New antiviral molecules that inhibit MERS-CoV and host cell receptor interaction may become available in the future. Additional studies are required to identify and characterize the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV EMC/2012 and other circulating strains. An effective MERS-CoV vaccine, for humans and/or camels, along with an efficient combination antiviral therapy may help us prevent future MERS cases.","publish_time":"2019-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Arinjay; Baid, Kaushal; Mossman, Karen","journal":"Curr Clin Microbiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f16dfb454e871fddc2252b9a072b5d0d15bc05e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100557.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-019-00122-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV molecular pathogenesis","effective MERS-CoV vaccine","molecular pathogenesis of MERS","CoV EMC","future MERS cases","Limited studies","current studies","Camels","Additional studies","human vaccine candidates","antiviral responses","human transmission","human cells","live virus","Multiple antiviral molecules","New antiviral molecules","virus-receptor interactions","efficient combination antiviral therapy","humans","candidate camel vaccine","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","RECENT FINDINGS","recent strategies","Combination of supportive treatment","travel-associated cases","host cell receptor interaction","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","World Health Organization\u2019s blueprint of priority diseases","potential","ectopic expression of viral proteins","ability","interferon","immediate research","direct contact","requirement of high containment laboratories","antivirals","SUMMARY","circulating strains","efficacy","reservoirs"],"language":"en"},

We show here that IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and -\u03BB induction via TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 was abolished in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. In contrast, IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and -\u03BB were induced normally by TLR-3 and TLR-4 agonists. Moreover, IFN-\u03B2 and -\u03BB were normally induced by TLR-3 agonists and viruses in IRAK-4-deficient fibroblasts.

Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oberemok, Volodymyr V.; Laikova, Kateryna V.; Yurchenko, Kseniya A.; Fomochkina, Irina I.; Kubyshkin, Anatolii V.","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/625a54c07fe19745b6673c9ab759617481bd6aec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350571/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-020-01352-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host population","virus-host relationship","novel virus","host organism","human population","challenging host immunity","population level","people","HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human beings","new features","new mutations","Pathogen-resistant individuals","SARS-CoV","non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses","coronavirus disease","low mortality","dead end","high mortality peaks","tens","pandemics","hundreds of thousands","emerging strain","viral epidemics","death chart","molecular structure of proteins","question","facts","obligate intracellular parasite","certain existential balance","backdrop","answer","drugs","dangers inherent","event","development","consequences","cells","complete elimination","COVID","survival","vaccines","future","scenarios","decades","turn","article"],"language":"en"},

Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). METHODS: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. RESULTS: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. CONCLUSION: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Gupta, Ritesh; Misra, Anoop","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d9c728274237f4eb1cce5faf8821b8f04d6dace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144598.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300564; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RASB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients of COVID","hypertensive patients","diabetes","established CVD","known hypertension","pooled data","emerging data hints","associated comorbidities","role of RASB","characteristics of comorbidities","Harm","benefit","heightened mortality","receptor of angiotensin","angiotensin system blockers","available Chinese studies","use of renin","increased association","topic","mechanistic equipoise","English language","advice of health care provider","various world organizations","tissues","MeSH key words","point of time","published articles","Special attention","expresses","relation","agents","outcome","multiple confounding factors","drugs","CONCLUSION","enzyme","cardiovascular disease","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","AIMS","medical database","pandemic","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time- and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health.

The causative agent is an Arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV). The pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS are poorly understood, but are believed to correlate with the ability of PRRSV to inhibit immune responses of the host. However, precisely how the virus is capable of doing so remains obscure. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection led to reduced ubiquitination of cellular proteins. Screening all of the 12 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) encoded by PRRSV revealed that, apart from the Nsp2 which contains the deubiqintinating (DUB) ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, Nsp11, which encodes a unique and conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) throughout the Nidovirus order, also possesses DUB activity. In vivo assay demonstrated that Nsp11 specifically removed lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains and the conserved sites C112, H144, D173, K180, and Y219 were critical for its DUB activity. Remarkably, DUB activity was responsible for the capacity of Nsp11 to inhibit nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) activation. Mutations abrogating the DUB activity of Nsp11 toward K48-linked polyubiquitin chains of I\u03BAB\u03B1 nullified the suppressive effect on NF-\u03BAB. Our data add Nsp11 to the list of DUBs encoded by PRRSV and uncover a novel mechanism by which PRRSV cripples host innate immune responses.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Dang; Fan, Jinxiu; Fang, Liurong; Luo, Rui; Ouyang, Haiping; Ouyang, Chao; Zhang, Huan; Chen, Huanchun; Li, Kui; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e14818bce005d0dcb0c8edea070e7567577bab02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112538.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589015300602; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589015300602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342881/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.08.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS","PRRSV","DUB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DUB activity of Nsp11","PRRSV infection","ability of PRRSV","capacity of Nsp11","PRRSV cripples host","NF-\u03BAB","PRRS virus","immune responses","K48-linked polyubiquitin chains of I\u03BAB\u03B1","nuclear factor \u03BAB","pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS","conserved endoribonuclease","nonstructural proteins","conserved sites C112","reduced ubiquitination of cellular proteins","D173","ovarian tumor","suppressive effect","K180","NendoU","H144","respiratory syndrome","Y219","OTU","novel mechanism","Nidovirus order","deubiqintinating","domain","Arterivirus","lysine","list of DUBs","emergence","Nsps","activation","Mutations","causative agent","Abstract","Screening","Nsp2","assay","data","study","swine industry"],"language":"en"},

Definite diagnosis of Leishmania infections is based on demonstration of the parasite by microscopic analysis of tissue biopsy specimens or aspirate samples. However, microscopy generally shows low sensitivity and requires invasive sampling. Methods. We describe here the development of a simple and rapid test for the detection of polymerase chain reaction-amplified Leishmania DNA. A phase 1 evaluation of the text was conducted in clinical samples from 60 nonendemic and 45 endemic control subjects and from 44 patients with confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), 12 with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and 43 with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) from Peru, Kenya, and Sudan. Results. The lower detection limits of the assay are 10 fg of Leishmania DNA and 1 parasite in 180 \u00B5L of blood. The specificity was 98.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.1%\u201399.7%) and 95.6% (95% CI, 85.2%\u201398.8%) for nonendemic and endemic control samples, respectively, and the sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 81.8%\u201397.7%), 91.7% (95% CI, 64.6%\u201398.5%), and 86% (95% CI, 72.7%\u201393.4%) for lesions from patients with CL or MCL and blood from patients with VL, respectively. Conclusions.

Jeju Island is the largest island in South Korea and has a distinctive oceanic climate. This study aimed to identify epidemiologic characteristics of scrub typhus on Jeju Island. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2016, 446 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus on Jeju Island. The patients\u2019 personal data and the environmental factors that might be related to scrub typhus were investigated and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58-years-old (range, 8 to 91) and 43% of them worked in the agricultural, forestry or livestock industry. Regardless of their job, 87% of the patients had a history of either working outdoors or of other activities before developing scrub typhus. The south and southeast regions of Jeju Island, especially Namwon-eup, showed the highest incidence of scrub typhus. Workers in mandarin orange orchards seemed to be the highest risk group for scrub typhus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus on Jeju Island showed unique characteristics. To efficiently prevent scrub typhus, each year individual regional approaches should be developed based on the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease.","publish_time":"2017-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sung Uk","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/146fa23813d36d8da4ea4ab928d5cac594fdbd44.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fd8ee38a505cf79732f5ba487e15f11619b84150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5675983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28823118/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2017039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Jeju Island"],"keyphrases":["scrub typhus infection","epidemiologic characteristics of scrub typhus","highest incidence of scrub typhus","largest island","southeast regions of Jeju Island","South Korea","unique characteristics","highest risk group","common febrile disease","Namwon-eup","year individual regional approaches","environmental factors","patients\u2019 personal data","mandarin orange orchards","distinctive oceanic climate","CONCLUSIONS","forestry","livestock industry","Workers","median age","years-old","autumn","RESULTS","study","OBJECTIVES","activities","job","history","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown that the human infection with avian influenza H5N1 could also target organs apart from the lungs. METHODS: We studied post-mortem tissues of two adults (one man and one pregnant woman) infected with H5N1 influenza virus, and a fetus carried by the woman. In-situ hybridisation (with sense and antisense probes to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) and immunohistochemistry (with monoclonal antibodies to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) were done on selected tissues. Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR, real-time RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) detection assays were also undertaken to detect viral RNA in organ tissue samples. FINDINGS: We detected viral genomic sequences and antigens in type II epithelial cells of the lungs, ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea, T cells of the lymph node, neurons of the brain, and Hofbauer cells and cytotrophoblasts of the placenta. Viral genomic sequences (but no viral antigens) were detected in the intestinal mucosa. In the fetus, we found viral sequences and antigens in the lungs, circulating mononuclear cells, and macrophages of the liver. The presence of viral sequences in the organs and the fetus was also confirmed by RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and NASBA. INTERPRETATION: In addition to the lungs, H5N1 influenza virus infects the trachea and disseminates to other organs including the brain. The virus could also be transmitted from mother to fetus across the placenta.","publish_time":"2007-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Jiang; Xie, Zhigang; Gao, Zhancheng; Liu, Jinhua; Korteweg, Christine; Ye, Juxiang; Lau, Lok Ting; Lu, Jie; Gao, Zifen; Zhang, Bo; McNutt, Michael A; Lu, Min; Anderson, Virginia M; Gong, Encong; Yu, Albert Cheung Hoi; Lipkin, W Ian","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78db66c751c49e72612fd9ba978495871d917912.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159293.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673607615153; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607615153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NASBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time RT-PCR","viral antigens","strand-specific RT-PCR","lungs","viral genomic sequences","fetus","H5N1 influenza virus","presence of viral sequences","viral RNA","avian influenza H5N1","T cells","Hofbauer cells","mononuclear cells","organs","non-ciliated epithelial cells","trachea","Human infection","nucleoprotein","haemagglutinin","NASBA","brain","placenta","pregnant woman","post-mortem tissues","selected tissues","respiratory symptoms","nucleic acid sequence-based amplification","emerging infectious disease","type","antisense probes","lymph node","immunohistochemistry","neurons","detection assays","monoclonal antibodies","high fatality rate","adults","organ tissue samples","cytotrophoblasts","BACKGROUND","addition","situ hybridisation","Reverse-transcriptase","macrophages","mother","FINDINGS","Previous studies","METHODS","INTERPRETATION","liver","intestinal mucosa"],"language":"en"},

Here we report cloning and characterization of a panel of nonhuman primate IFITMs. We show that, similar to human IFITM, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins inhibit HIV and other primate lentiviruses. While some nonhuman primate IFITM proteins are more potent than human counterparts to inhibit HIV-1, they are generally not effective against HIV-2 similar to that of human IFITMs. Notably, depending on SIV strains and also IFITM species tested, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins exhibit distinct activities against SIVs; no correlation was found to support the notion that IFITM proteins are most active in non-natural primate hosts. Consistent with our recent findings for human IFITMs, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins interact with HIV-1 Env and strongly act in viral producer cells to impair viral infectivity and block cell-to-cell transmission. Accordingly, knockdown of primate IFITM3 increases HIV-1 replication in nohuman primate cells. Interestingly, analysis of DNA sequences of human and nonhuman primate IFITMs suggest that IFITM proteins have been undergoing purifying selection, rather than positive selection typical for cellular restriction factors. Overall, our study reveals some new and unexpected features of IFITMs in restricting primate lentiviruses, which enhances our understanding of virus-host interaction and AIDS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkins, Jordan; Zheng, Yi-Min; Yu, Jingyou; Liang, Chen; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/945fd47a82b49774675d732d27f6b806c0e6aeb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4892622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257969/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156739","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM","SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonhuman primate IFITM proteins","primate lentiviruses","HIV","panel of nonhuman primate IFITMs","IFITM species","human IFITMs","nohuman primate cells","non-natural primate hosts","knockdown of primate IFITM3","human counterparts","unexpected features of IFITMs","analysis of DNA sequences of human","potent antiviral factors","viral producer cells","purifying selection","viral infectivity","block cell","cell transmission","positive selection typical","cellular restriction factors","distinct activities","replication","recent findings","host interaction","understanding of virus","SIVs","AIDS pathogenesis","correlation","infection","characterization","notion","study","enveloped viruses","SIV strains","cloning","Interferon"],"language":"en"},

In order to study the influence of the panel on the displacement ventilated room, the temperature and contaminant concentration profiles were examined under different panel conditions: the distance between the panel and bed, height of the panel, surface temperature of the panel, and supply airflow rate. When the radiant panel was heated, it created a stronger plume than the human body, which produced contaminated air. When there was space between the radiant panel and bed, the contaminated air was locked up before reaching the ceiling. Personal exposure of a standing person was also investigated because the contaminated interface is generally lower than the breathing zone of a standing person with DV. The zonal model and improved zonal model were validated by a comparison of their results with the measured contaminant concentrations.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Narae; Yamanaka, Toshio; Sagara, Kazunobu; Momoi, Yoshihisa; Suzuki, Tomoya","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b00605e7cfa9eb04648b5e3b02bd834dc2e1878f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116985.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036013231930407X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287990/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231930407X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106197","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Displacement"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vertical radiant panel","contaminated air","different panel conditions","contaminant interface height","contaminated interface","DV system","high air quality","contaminant concentration profiles","bed","measured contaminant concentrations","standing person","displacement ventilated room","improved zonal model","Abstract Displacement ventilation","occupant zone","breathing zone","surface temperature","ventilation efficiency","complementary heating system","serious odor problem","human body","distance","hospital wards","results","comparison","supply airflow rate","stronger plume","Personal exposure","influence","space","paper","order","ceiling"],"language":"en"},

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score \u2265 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. Ethics and dissemination The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fortun\u00E9, Catherine;

In developed countries, serum selenium level has never been investigated during acute measles. The aim of this study was to determine serum selenium concentrations in French patients with acute measles and to seek correlations with clinical and virological findings. Patients and methods We studied serum selenium concentrations in 94 French patients with acute measles and in 99 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Results The mean of selenium concentration was significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (46.4\u00B114.1\u03BCg/L versus 86.5\u00B113.9\u03BCg/L, P \u003C0.0001). In the patients, selenium concentrations were not associated with age, sex, vaccination status, clinical signs or specific antibody responses. Selenium levels did not differ significantly between patients with uncomplicated measles (45.8\u00B114.2\u03BCg/L) and patients with complications (52.7\u00B113.2\u03BCg/L) (P =0.15).

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env binds to cell surface\u2013associated receptor (CD4) and coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) by one of its two non-covalently associated subunits, gp120. The induced conformational changes activate the other subunit (gp41), which causes the fusion of the viral with the plasma cell membranes resulting in the delivery of the viral genome into the cell and the initiation of the infection cycle. As the only HIV protein exposed to the environment, the Env is also a major immunogen to which neutralizing antibodies are directed and a target that is relatively easy to access by inhibitors. A fundamental problem in the development of effective vaccines and inhibitors against HIV is the rapid generation of alterations at high levels of expression during long chronic infection and the resulting signi\uFB01cant heterogeneity of the Env. The preservation of the Env function as an entry mediator and limitations on size and expression impose restrictions on its variability and lead to the existence of conserved structures.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prabakaran, Ponraj; Dimitrov, Antony S.; Fouts, Timothy R.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Advances in Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/690122403fa6fecea29b4593f871963855f66649.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111665.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054358907550027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054358907550027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Env function","inhibitors","interactions of conserved Env structures","associated receptor","cell surface","antibodies","HIV protein","plasma cell membranes","existence of conserved structures","receptor molecules","chronic infection","associated subunits","infection cycle","viral genome","high levels of expression","resulting signi\uFB01cant heterogeneity","limitations","implications","advances","rapid generation of alterations","CD4","entry mediator","development of effective vaccines","restrictions","size","coreceptor","lead","delivery","envelope glycoprotein","design of vaccine immunogens","chapter","variability","initiation","human immunodeficiency virus","fundamental problem","induced conformational changes","gp41","Publisher Summary","CCR5","gp120","fusion","major immunogen","environment","CXCR4"],"language":"en"},

In this Review, we describe the emerging role of mass spectrometry, with its different technical facets, in structural biology, focusing especially on structural virology. We describe how mass spectrometry has evolved into a tool that can provide unique structural and functional information about viral\u2010protein and protein\u2010complex structure, conformation, assembly, and topology, extending to the direct analysis of intact virus capsids of several million Dalton in mass. Mass spectrometry is now used to address important questions in virology ranging from how viruses assemble to how they interact with their host.","publish_time":"2011-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uetrecht, Charlotte; Heck, Albert J.

The recycling of biological wastes by aerobic or anaerobic biotechnological treatment is necessary to protect the environment and to save natural resources. The recycling process may be conducted either in large-scale plants operated mostly in urban industrial areas, or in small plants operated primarily in the rural environment to improve the farmer\u0027s income. A relatively large number of pathogens are found in solid and liquid organic wastes and the most prevalent are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Fungi present in wastes and materials used for composting are mainly of interest from the point of view of occupational health and phytohygiene. The presence of parasites or their infective stages in wastes or residues of plant, animal, or human origin depends on the nature of the wastes and the level of pretreatment. Parasites are of veterinary and medical importance if the raw materials used for composting are generated in wastewater treatment facilities or in slaughterhouses. Plant pathogenic parasites must also be considered, even if some of them are highly specialized on certain plants, which limit their epidemiological importance. Cyst-forming nematodes are the most relevant because these cysts may survive in the soil for several years.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6hm, R.","journal":"Waste Management Series","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95265b42470e6ecb45b598ac3e366dabd1afa638.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1478748207800121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1478748207800121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liquid organic wastes","recycling of biological wastes","small plants","large-scale plants","certain plants","presence of parasites","Plant pathogenic parasites","composting","Fungi present","pathogens of humans","rural environment","residues of plant","raw materials","medical importance","epidemiological importance","recycling process","anaerobic biotechnological treatment","wastewater treatment facilities","large number of pathogens","infective stages","urban industrial areas","occupational health","chapter","human origin","nature","viruses","bacteria","point of view","phytohygiene","Publisher Summary","farmer\u0027s income","slaughterhouses","animals","level of pretreatment","nematodes","soil","cysts","natural resources","years"],"language":"en"},

The 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses and minimal sequence similarity with host proteins; therefore, the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) belongs to the Picornavidea family and is a major threat to the poultry industry. To date, little is known about the roles of the DHAV 3C protease plays during infection. METHODS: In this study, we compared the full-length DHAV 3C protein sequence with other 3C sequences to obtain an alignment for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Then, we expressed and purified recombinant DHAV 3C protease in the BL21 expression system using nickel-NTA affinity chromatography. The optimization of the cleavage assay conditions and the kinetic analysis for DHAV 3C protease were done by in vitro cleavage assays with a fluorogenic peptide respectively. The inhibitory activity of rupintrivir against the DHAV 3C protease was further evaluated. The localization of the 3C protease in infected and transfected cells was determined using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Under different expression conditions, the 3C protease was found to be highly expressed after induction with 1 mM IPTG at 16 \u00B0C for 10 h. We synthesized a fluorogenic peptide derived from the cleavage site of the DHAV polyprotein and evaluated the protease activity of the DHAV 3C protease for the first time. We used fluorimetric based kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters, and V(max) and K(m) values were determined to be 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 \u03BCM, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease. Using polyclonal antibody and an indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA), it was determined that the DHAV 3C protease was found in the nucleus during infection. In addition, the DHAV 3C protease can enter into the nucleus without the cooperation of viral proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the activity of the DHAV 3C protease, and the activity of the DHAV 3C protease is temperature-, pH- and NaCl concentration- dependent. The DHAV 3C protease localizes throughout DHAV-infected cells and can enter into the nucleus in the absence of other viral proteins. The kinetic analysis was calculated, and the V(max) and K(m) values were 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 \u03BCM, respectively, using the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot.","publish_time":"2019-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Di; Wang, Mingshu; Wen, Xingjian; Mao, Sai; Cheng, Anchun; Jia, Renyong; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; Chen, Xiaoyue; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/636fb28e842b058bff497388c5444fc1f53cb61c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6489322.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036013/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1155-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rupintrivir"],"organizations":["DHAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C protease","protease activity","C sequences","DHAV polyprotein","full-length DHAV","recombinant DHAV","C protein sequence","DHAV-infected cells","kinetic analysis","cooperation of viral proteins","inhibitory activity of rupintrivir","nucleus","kinetic parameters","viral translation","viral polyprotein maturation","cleavage assay conditions","multiple cleavages of host proteins","different expression conditions","cleavage site","cleavage assays","fluorogenic peptide","study","nmol","max","infection","\u03BCM","values","indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay","minimal sequence similarity","structural similarity","different picornaviruses","transfected cells","confocal microscopy","BL21 expression system","nickel-NTA affinity chromatography","major threat","picornaviral","temperature","polyclonal antibody","IFA","Picornavidea family","alignment","development of potent inhibitors","antiviral drug","valid target","NaCl concentration- dependent","construction","poultry industry","Lineweaver","RESULTS","Duck hepatitis","optimization","transcription","absence","fluorimetric","BACKGROUND","roles","addition","phylogenetic tree","Burk plot","IPTG","localization","time","induction","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","date"],"language":"en"},

Empirical treatment regimens use broad-spectrum antimicrobials. AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of HAP and to describe the demographic and microbiological features of patients with HAP. METHODS: Medical and surgical inpatients receiving intravenous antimicrobials for a clinical diagnosis of HAP at a UK tertiary care hospital between April 2013 and 2014 were identified. Demographic and clinical details were recorded. FINDINGS: A total of 166 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of HAP were identified. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were prescribed, primarily piperacillin\u2013tazobactam (57.2%) and co-amoxiclav (12.5%). Sputum from 24.7% of patients was obtained for culture. Sixty-five percent of patients had radiological evidence of new/progressive infiltrate at the time of HAP treatment, therefore meeting HAP diagnostic criteria (2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines). Radiologically confirmed HAP was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and sputum culture positivity. Previous surgery and/or endotracheal intubation were associated with radiologically confirmed HAP. A bacterial pathogen was identified from 17/35 sputum samples from radiologically confirmed HAP patients. These were Gram-negative bacilli (N = 11) or Staphylococcus aureus (N = 6). Gram-negative bacteria tended to be resistant to co-amoxiclav, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and meropenem. Five of the six S. aureus isolates were meticillin susceptible and all were susceptible to doxycycline. CONCLUSION: In ward-level hospital practice \u2018HAP\u2019 is an over-used diagnosis that may be inaccurate in 35% of cases when objective radiological criteria are applied. Radiologically confirmed HAP represents a distinct clinical and microbiological phenotype. Potential risk factors were identified that could represent targets for preventive interventions.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, C.D.; Koch, O.; Laurenson, I.F.; O\u0027Shea, D.T.; Sutherland, R.; Mackintosh, C.L.","journal":"J Hosp Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf424b8d9c4e6a50222263173dafdd14af5ec140.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172606.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2015.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810613/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670115004934; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670115004934","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Radiologically"],"organizations":["HAP","UK","American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed HAP patients","clinical diagnosis of HAP","HAP diagnostic criteria","time of HAP treatment","adult patients","percent of patients","confirmed pneumonia","microbiological features of patients","non-intubated patients","broad-spectrum antimicrobials","clinical details","intravenous antimicrobials","meticillin susceptible","sputum samples","over-used diagnosis","sputum culture positivity","piperacillin","co-amoxiclav","tazobactam","demographic","objective radiological criteria","ward-level hospital practice","UK tertiary care hospital","microbiological phenotype","aureus isolates","Staphylococcus aureus","Gram-negative bacteria","Gram-negative bacilli","American Thoracic Society","radiological evidence of new","Empirical treatment regimens","Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines","progressive infiltrate","higher levels of inflammatory markers","ciprofloxacin","surgical inpatients","hospitalization","endotracheal intubation","cases","targets","Previous surgery","METHODS","CONCLUSION","meropenem","total","accuracy","bacterial pathogen","Potential risk factors","preventive interventions","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","doxycycline","AIM"],"language":"en"},

We conclude this research by arguing that the KCG was more concerned about hierarchical, political, and legal accountability than professional accountability in the midst of the accident, and discuss theoretical and practical ramifications of our findings.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Jongsoon; Song, Geoboo","journal":"Risk Hazards Crisis Public Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9e5f31a5101ab6d72776a4c782cc2b64c7cede1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rhc3.12115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KCG"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["post\u2010disaster rescue operations","professional accountability","legal accountability","Sewol ferry accident","broader context of Sewol ferry disaster management","unsuccessful disaster response","classic theories of bureaucratic accountability","South Korea","Korea Coast Guard","excessive death toll","behaviors","attitudes","ocean","midst","primary reasons","practical ramifications","systemic cause","findings","KCG\u0027s aptitudes","loss","lives","research","study"],"language":"en"},

Early intervention is a crucial prognostic factor and a HLA-haploidentical parental donor is often available. Haploidentical HSCT protocols utilizing extensively ex vivo T-cell depleted grafts (CliniMACs system) have proven efficient in preventing GvHD, but cause a delay in early T-cell recovery that increases the risk of viral infections. Here, we present a novel approach for treating SCID that combines selective depletion of GvHD-inducing alpha/beta (\u03B1/\u03B2) T-cells from the haploidentical HSCT graft with a subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) enriched for CD45RO\u002B memory T-cells. RESULTS: Our patient was diagnosed with SCID (T-B \u002B NK\u002B phenotype). At 9 months of age, he received a T cell receptor(TCR)\u03B1/\u03B2-cell depleted graft from his haploidentical mother, following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen with no additional GvHD prophylaxis. Engraftment was rapid with complete donor chimerism and no signs of GvHD. However, at 12 weeks post HSCT, the patient was still T-cell lymphopenic with clinical symptoms of multiple severe viral infections. Consequently, therapeutic DLIs were initiated for enhanced anti-viral immunity. The patient was treated with CD45RA\u002B depleted haploidentical maternal donor lymphocytes enriched from unmobilized whole blood, and a total T-cell dose of no more than 25 x10(3) CD3\u002B cells/kg with \u003E99.9 % purity of CD3 \u002B CD45RO\u002B memory T-cells was transferred. Following the DLI, a prompt increase in CD3 \u002B CD4\u002B and CD3 \u002B CD8\u002B counts was observed with a subsequent clearance of viral infections. No acute or chronic GvHD was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Automated depletion of CD45RA\u002B na\u00EFve T-cells from unmobilized whole blood is a simple and rapid strategy to provide unmanipulated DLIs, with a potentially broad repertoire of pathogen specific memory T-cells. In the haploidentical setting, CD45RA\u002B depleted DLIs can be safely administered at low T-cell doses for efficient enhancement of viral immunity and limited risk of GvHD. We demonstrate the successful use of this approach following TCR-\u03B1/\u03B2-cell depleted HSCT for the treatment of SCID.","publish_time":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brodszki, Nicholas; Turkiewicz, Dominik; Toporski, Jacek; Truedsson, Lennart; Dykes, Josefina","journal":"Orphanet J Rare Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/968d0b07b0b65a15cedfd2357e3ba9649742836e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4714422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26768987/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-016-0385-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","SCID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cell lymphopenic","T cell receptor","T-cell depleted grafts","T-B","na\u00EFve T-cells","early T-cell recovery","low T-cell doses","\u03B2-cell depleted HSCT","total T-cell dose","\u03B2-cell depleted graft","haploidentical HSCT graft","Haploidentical HSCT protocols","depleted DLIs","risk of viral infections","signs of GvHD","chronic GvHD","limited risk of GvHD","broad repertoire of pathogen specific memory T-cells","haploidentical mother","haploidentical setting","depleted haploidentical maternal donor lymphocytes","selective depletion of GvHD","HLA-haploidentical parental donor","subsequent clearance of viral infections","treatment of SCID","additional GvHD prophylaxis","patient","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","TCR-\u03B1","clinical symptoms of multiple severe viral infections","efficient enhancement of viral immunity","purity of CD3","increased risk of graft","enhanced anti-viral immunity","high incidence of severe infections","complete donor chimerism","subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion","blood","Automated depletion of CD45RA","unmanipulated DLIs","CD45RO","therapeutic DLIs","severe combined immunodeficiency","curative treatment available","rapid strategy","Early intervention","novel approach","reduced intensity conditioning regimen","crucial prognostic factor","alpha","CliniMACs system","BACKGROUND","beta","delay","host-disease","prompt increase","counts","Engraftment","NK","CD8","successful use","CONCLUSIONS","phenotype","x10","months of age","weeks","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on arginine uptake using the porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 as a model system. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses showed that TGEV infection leads to reduced arginine uptake at 48 hours post-infection (hpi). Expression of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) was attenuated as well. TGEV infection induced activation of phospho-protein kinase C \u03B1 (p-PKC \u03B1), phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), and enhanced the expression of caveolin-1, all of which appear to be involved in down-regulating arginine uptake and CAT-1 expression.

Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, R.N.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6e92eda6c26b456165422d4e5552b81754c4a82.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f4b5d0b90d18c8fd2d0bd218587d2ac601df9965.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","South Korea","Thailand","Japan"],"keyphrases":["imported case","evidence of sustained human","human transmission outside of China","risk of sustained transmission","probability","countries","current outbreak","hospitalisation","symptom onset","patients","ongoing outbreak","outbreak of pneumonia","nCoV","SARS coronavirus","importance of current surveillance efforts","intense surveillance","Thailand","South Korea","Japan","world","times","mean time","USA","large global epidemic","confirmed cases","Data","Wuhan","assumptions","estimate","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Thirteen lipid metabolites could discriminate between CAP cases and non-CAP controls with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of \u003E0.8 (P \u2264 10(\u22129)). The levels of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines and L-palmitoylcarnitine were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower in the CAP cases than those in non-CAP controls. All 13 metabolites could distinguish CAP cases from the non-infection, extrapulmonary infection and non-CAP respiratory tract infection subgroups.

In this study we demonstrate that these chimeras are capable of packaging large amounts of human APOBEC3G (hA3G), and that an HIV-1 Gag chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal half of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N as a substitute for NC is capable of directing VLP assembly and efficiently packaging hA3G. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N and M (membrane) proteins, hA3G was efficiently incorporated into SARS-CoV VLPs. Data from GST pull-down assays suggest that the N sequence involved in N\u2013hA3G interactions is located between residues 86 and 302. Like HIV-1 NC, the SARS-CoV or HCoV-229E N-associated with hA3G depends on the presence of RNA, with the first linker region essential for hA3G packaging into both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV VLPs. The results raise the possibility that hA3G is capable of associating with different species of viral structural proteins through a potentially common, RNA-mediated mechanism.","publish_time":"2009-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shui-Mei; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f98da9c3b895a5e810f9f81b258e83bbea635690.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209001834; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209001834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19345973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP","GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["packaging hA3G","hA3G packaging","E N","hA3G interactions","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","SARS-CoV VLPs","N sequence","wild-type HIV","capable of associating","HCoV","results","residues","capable of packaging large amounts of human APOBEC3G","VLP assembly","presence of RNA","RNA-mediated mechanism","carboxyl-terminal half of human coronavirus","different species of viral structural proteins","particle","chimeras","linker region essential","domain","GST pull-down assays","level comparable","Gag chimera","production","efficient virus","possibility","substitute","membrane","Data","study"],"language":"en"},

Of the intestinal contents collected from 43 PES cases, 25 were positive for rotavirus and 13 for small round viruses by electron microscopy (EM). Of the enteric virus-positive cases by EM (n = 27), 16 cases had rotavirus or small round viruses alone and the remaining 11 cases had both viruses. None of the cases were positive for reovirus or coronavirus by EM. However, with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 40 cases (93%) were positive for rotavirus, 36 (84%) for TAstV-2, and 17 (40%) for reovirus. None of the cases were positive for turkey coronavirus by RT-PCR. The viruses from all cases were detected either alone or in combination of 2 or 3 by RT-PCR. Thus, 8 (19%) cases were positive for a single virus, whereas a combination of viruses was detected in the remaining 35 (81%) cases. The rota-TAstV-2 combination was the most predominant (n = 18 cases). Fifteen cases were positive for all 3 viruses. The rotaviruses had sequence homology of 89.8 to 100% with previously published sequences of turkey rotaviruses at the nucleotide level. The TAstV-2 had sequence homology of 84.6 to 98.7% with previously published TAstV-2, whereas reoviruses had sequence homology of 91.6 to 99.3% with previously published sequences of turkey reoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rota- and reoviruses clustered in a single group, whereas TAstV-2 clustered in 2 different groups. In conclusion, a larger number of PES cases was positive for rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus by RT-PCR than with EM. The presence of more than one virus and changes at the genetic level in a virus may affect the severity of PES in turkey flocks.","publish_time":"2010-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jindal, N.; Patnayak, D.

Significant efforts have been made to develop useful methods for leachate disposition and treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the most promising methods, because they can rapidly degrade diverse pollutants and significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating conjugated polymer, has become a hot topic in AOP research due to its metal-free benefits and high photosensitivity. Thus, combining AOPs with g-C3N4 achieves excellent degradation of refractory pollutants in leachate. Since the composition of leachate is complex in the practical conditions, the information reported by current studies of using g-C3N4 as a remediator is still incomplete and fragmented. Thus, in this review, the recent status of leachate treatment and approaches for its disposal has been summarized and some conclusions have been drawn. In addition, a brief introduction to g-C3N4 and its application in AOPs for leachate treatment have been critically discussed and with its future outlook assessed. Although the development of g-C3N4 in AOPs for leachate treatment is highly efficient and practical, comprehensive study about its application and technology expansion is urgently needed, based on the complex operating conditions. Perspectives on the treatment of leachate using g-C3N4-AOPs are also included. The information and perspectives provided in this review will provide guidance and novel understanding to accelerate the development of g-C3N4-based AOPs for leachate treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Meina; Duan, Xiaoguang; Cao, Guoliang; Zhu, Shishu; Ho, Shih-Hsin","journal":"Process Saf Environ Prot","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8791e9d0c04050e1e34e0a7081c0f8e20230f312.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198436.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582020309010?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.04.046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582020309010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of leachate","g-C3N4","leachate disposition","biodegradability of leachate","composition of leachate","C3N4-based AOPs","development of g","recent status of leachate treatment","Abstract Landfill leachate","application","review","practical conditions","information","Perspectives","refractory organic compounds","complex operating conditions","release of high","excellent degradation of refractory pollutants","high photosensitivity","significant risks","useful methods","Significant efforts","diverse pollutants","promising methods","ammonia-nitrogen compounds","public health","toxicity contaminants","comprehensive study","metal-free benefits","approaches","hot topic","AOP research","novel understanding","current studies","fascinating conjugated polymer","remediator","brief introduction","Graphitic carbon nitride","disposal","technology expansion","heavy metals","guidance","Advanced oxidation processes","addition","future outlook","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down. Material and methods A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis. Results There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2. Conclusion Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression (infection rate and death) exponentially. The success story of non-lock-down countries (Sweden and South Korea) need to be explored in detail, to identify the variables responsible for the positive results.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosal, Samit; Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Majumder, Milan","journal":"Diabetes \u0026 metabolic syndrome","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426062/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301454?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion Lockdown"],"locations":["South Korea","Germany","Austria","New Zealand","India","Hungary","Poland","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["countries","declared lockdown","infection rates","stringent lockdown","impact of lockdown","spread of infection","Conclusion Lockdown","phase cluster analysis","hierarchical cluster analysis","week post lockdown","death rates","South Korea","Sweden","Malaysia-cluster","France-cluster","SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","Simple regression analysis","India cohorts","success story of non-lock","rate of change","positive results","Spain","deaths","Hungary","disease progression","period of time","New Zealand","higher baseline infections","Italy","Germany","UK","Poland","Austria","social distancing","preventive strategies","validated database","Belgium","order","reduction","Material","methods","variables responsible","attempt","counties","line of management","effective strategy","Abstract Introduction","effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, policymakers need to improve their understanding of how crisis events affect the demand for inbound tourism. From the first quarter of 1996 to the second quarter of 2006, Taiwan experienced four major disasters at approximately two-year intervals. These disasters included the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the 21st September 1999 earthquake, the 11th September 2001 attacks in the United States, and the outbreak of SARS in 2003. This paper examines the impact of crisis events on the demand for tourism in order to establish a better understanding of changes and trends in the demand for international tourism.

This paper also explores the influence of variables, such as foreign exchange rates, incomes, relative prices, and transportation costs, on the dynamics of the demand for inbound tourism. This paper finds that a long-term equilibrium exists among all variables, indicating that macroeconomic variables may be used to determine the rise or fall of the number of inbound tourism arrivals. Income and foreign exchange rates are both significant explanatory variables. In terms of incurred losses, the number of inbound tourism arrivals suffered the greatest decline during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), followed by the 21st September 1999 earthquake and the 11th September 2001 attacks. The impact of the Asian financial crisis was relatively mild. This paper finds that any impact on safety, whether domestic or international, negatively affects tourism demand. The impact of financial crises on tourism demand is less significant. Ensuring the safety and health of tourists is the key to maintain demand for inbound tourism.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yu-Shan","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3faa0f8b77a14187b6213a72260a0bb23651aac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115617.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517708000800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517708000800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287727/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2008.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Smith","M.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection. International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chadi, Sami A; Guidolin, Keegan; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Sharkawy, Abdu; Spinelli, Antonino; Quereshy, Fayez A; Okrainec, Allan","journal":"Annals of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433285/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risks of viral transmission","laparoscopic surgery","risk of viral transmission","exposure of operating room staff","operating room staff exposure","viral particles","open surgery","mitigation measures","invasive surgical approaches","invasive approaches","OBJECTIVE","evidence-based opinion","risk of aerosolization","existing literature","patient care","surgical procedures","operative approach","narrative review","significant advantages","respect","SARS-CoV","decisions","concerns","virus","appropriate equipment","pandemic","SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA","infection","use of laparoscopy","International society guidelines","healthcare system","cautious course of action","recommendations","surgeons","expertise","topic","world","safety","well-being","benefits","METHODS","findings","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","institution","case"],"language":"en"},

The actual procedure for producing a metal shadow is relatively simple; a heavy metal is evaporated from a source at an oblique angle to the specimen. The metal atoms pile up on the surfaces that face the source, but the surfaces away from the source are shielded and receive little metal deposit, creating a \u201Cshadow.\u201D However, the process of producing biological specimens that are suitable for metal shadowing can be very complex. There are a whole host of specimen preparation techniques that can precede metal shadowing, and all provide superior preservation in comparison to air drying, a required step in negative staining procedures. The physical forces present during air drying (i.e., surface tension of the water\u2013air interface) will literally crush most biological specimens as they dry. In this chapter I explain the development of and procedures for the production of biological specimens from macromolecular assemblies (e.g., DNA and RNA), purified isolated molecules (e.g., proteins), and isolated viruses and bacteria preparations suitable for metal shadowing. A variation on this basic technique is to rotate the specimen during the metal deposition to produce a high-resolution three-dimensional rendering of the specimen.","publish_time":"2013-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hendricks, Gregory M.","journal":"Electron Microscopy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c2e89b24c7f8e906bc7cd9a6119b41156a61f18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120032.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24357360/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-776-1_5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Metal shadowing of bacteria","metal deposition","heavy metal","metal atoms","little metal deposit","production of biological specimens","ultrastructure of biological specimens","source","air drying","isolated viruses","isolated molecules","macromolecular assemblies","air interface","surfaces","host of specimen preparation techniques","bacteria preparations suitable","high-resolution method","high-resolution three-dimensional rendering","negative staining procedures","required step","surface tension","superior preservation","comparison","water","RNA","DNA","proteins","development","basic technique","physical forces","oblique angle","actual procedure","variation","process","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main causative agent of bronchiolitis, whereas rhinovirus (RV) is most commonly detected in wheezing children thereafter. Severe respiratory illness induced by either of these viruses is associated with subsequent development of asthma, and the risk is greatest for young children who wheeze with RV infections. Whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma is the subject of intense debate. RSV-induced wheezing illnesses during infancy influence respiratory health for years. There is definitive evidence that RSV-induced bronchiolitis can damage the airways to promote airway obstruction and recurrent wheezing. RV likely causes less structural damage and yet is a significant contributor to wheezing illnesses in young children and in the context of asthma. For both viruses, interactions between viral virulence factors, personal risk factors (eg, genetics), and environmental exposures (eg, airway microbiome) promote more severe wheezing illnesses and the risk for progression to asthma. In addition, allergy and asthma are major risk factors for more frequent and severe RV-related illnesses. Treatments that inhibit inflammation have efficacy for RV-induced wheezing, whereas the anti-RSV mAb palivizumab decreases the risk of severe RSV-induced illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. Developing a greater understanding of personal and environmental factors that promote more severe viral illnesses might lead to new strategies for the prevention of viral wheezing illnesses and perhaps reduce the subsequent risk for asthma.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, Tuomas; Gern, James E.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/caf06e2cc4e83f7b6bdadc427445f2e72f000655.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172811.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917313453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987219/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917313453","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe wheezing illnesses","severe viral illnesses","RV-induced wheezing","wheezing children","prevention of viral wheezing illnesses","recurrent wheezing","severe RV-related illnesses","risk of severe RSV-induced illness","subsequent risk","personal risk factors","RSV-induced bronchiolitis","major risk factors","Viral infections","context of asthma","RV infections","viral virulence factors","Severe respiratory illness","subsequent development of asthma","environmental factors","young children","subsequent recurrent wheeze","anti-RSV mAb palivizumab","viruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","infancy influence respiratory health","airway microbiome","environmental exposures","airway obstruction","structural damage","greater understanding of personal","main causative agent of bronchiolitis","new strategies","airways","significant contributor","interactions","genetics","allergy","efficacy","years","rhinovirus","inflammation","definitive evidence","progression","subject of intense debate","addition","Treatments","ages"],"language":"en"},

Mutants were preselected on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia in infected cells at the restrictive temperature (40\u00B0) vs the permissive temperature (31\u00B0). Of these mutants, only those with a relative plating efficiency 40\u00B0 31\u00B0 of 3 \u00D7 10\u22123 or smaller were kept. Virus yields at 40\u00B0 compared to 37\u00B0 and 31\u00B0 (leakiness) were determined. Most mutants (16) were RNA\u2212, i.e., unable to synthesize virus-specific RNA at the restrictive temperature. The other four were RNA\u002B. No qualitative differences were detected in the virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with RNA\u002B ts-mutants, both at 31\u00B0 and 40\u00B0. Virus-specific proteins present in cells infected with is-171 (RNA\u2212) and the RNA\u002B-mutants (ts-43, is-201, is-209, and is-279) were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. No qualitative differences in the pattern of virus-specific cellular proteins were detected among the mutants except for an additional polypeptide of about 46,000 daltons in ts-209-infected cells. Finally, the neuropathogenic properties of eight of the mutants were investigated. Whereas 102 PFU of wild-type virus injected intracerebrally killed 50 to 100% of 4-week-old Balc/c mice within 1 week, the mutants were highly attenuated. A dose of 105 PFU lead to no or transient disease.

The checklist was used for both direct-observation and self-reported data collection purposes. Pearson correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) were utilized to statistically determine the relationship between healthcare workers\u2019 reports of hand hygiene practices and observed hand hygiene behaviors. The study was conducted in the outpatient examination rooms and emergency departments of three types of hospitals in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic and is observed in routine cases and outbreaks. The total sample size included 87 physicians and nurses recruited while on duty during the scheduled observation periods, with each healthcare worker being observed during individual medical examinations with at least three patients. No statistically significant correlations between the healthcare workers\u2019 perceptions of hand hygiene practices and healthcare workers\u2019 actual behaviors were evident. Based on the self-report questionnaires, significant differences were found between physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 hand hygiene practices reports. Healthcare workers clearly understand the importance of careful hand hygiene practices, but based on researchers\u2019 observations, the medical personnel failed to properly implement protocol-driven hand hygiene applications.

However, its epidemic patterns and co-infection characteristics are not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: We attempted to determine the level of genetic variation of RSV, and describe the prevalence and co-infection characteristics of RSV in Hangzhou during two epidemic seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Single respiratory samples from 1820 pediatric patients were screened for RSV and genotyped by RT-PCR and sequencing. In all RSV positive specimens, we screened for viruses and atypical bacteria. Demographic and clinical information was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 34.5% and 3.8% of samples from acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were positive for RSV, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 61.1% of the selected 167 RSV strains were NA1, 31.1% were BA, 3.6% were ON1, 2.4% were CB1, and 1.8% were NA3. A new genotype, BA11 was identified, which comprised 98.1% of BA strains in this study, while the rest were BA10. A total of 36.4% and 9.1% of RSV-positive children with ALRI and ILI respectively were found to be co-infected. Rhinovirus was the most common additional respiratory virus, followed by human metapneumovirus. Except for fever, no significant differences in other clinical presentation between the RSV mono-infection and co-infection groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The circulating RSV strains had high genetic variability with RSV-B showing a more local pattern. In ALRI cases, co-infection of RSV with other viruses or atypical bacteria has no significant effect on the clinical presentation except fever.","publish_time":"2015-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Xinfen; Kou, Yu; Xia, Daozong; Li, Jun; Yang, Xuhui; Zhou, Yinyan; He, Xiaoyan","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8df049d1dd965c6ffa5c9bd7f65e655dabd4fa27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185398.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001602; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.05.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ILI"],"locations":["Hangzhou"],"keyphrases":["co-infection of RSV","RSV-B","RSV mono-infection","co-infection characteristics of RSV","RSV-positive children","circulating RSV strains","RSV positive specimens","level of genetic variation of RSV","infection groups","clinical presentation","BA strains","Single respiratory samples","Human respiratory syncytial virus","common additional respiratory virus","viruses","ALRI cases","atypical bacteria","clinical information","fever","total","acute lower respiratory tract infections","significant effect","significant differences","STUDY DESIGN","human metapneumovirus","epidemic patterns","epidemic seasons","high genetic variability","Hangzhou","influenza","pediatric patients","prevalence","BACKGROUND","illness","NA1","important viral pathogen","Rhinovirus","RT-PCR","CONCLUSIONS","local pattern","CB1","new genotype","BA11","sequencing","ON1","rest","BA10","Phylogenetic analysis","NA3","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Astroviruses have been detected in fecal samples from a wide variety of mammals and birds that are associated with gastroenteritis and extra enteric manifestations. In the present study, RT-PCR was used to investigate the presence of MAstV5 in 269 dog fecal samples. MAstV5 was detected in 26% (71/269) of the samples. Interestingly, all MAstV5-positive samples derived from dogs displaying clinical signs suggestive of gastroenteritis, other enteric viruses were simultaneously detected (canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus and canine rotavirus). Based on genomic sequence analysis of MAstV5 a novel classification of the species into four genotypes, MAstV5a-MAstV5d, is proposed.

In spite of that, there are still massive challenges that have not been resolved. Although the incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the developed world, it is still a significant public health problem in the rest of the world. There are still over 2 million deaths annually from tuberculosis, with most of these occurring in the developing world. Even with the development of new pharmaceuticals to treat tuberculosis, there is no indication that the disease will be eradicated. Respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pertussis are other respiratory infectious diseases with special problems of their own, from vaccine development to vaccine coverage. Asthma, one of the most common chronic diseases in children, still accounts for significant mortality and morbidity, as well as high health care costs worldwide. Even in developed countries such as the USA, there are over 4,000 deaths per year. Severe asthma presents a special problem, but the question is whether there can be one treatment pathway for all patients with severe asthma. Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes and endotypes. The gene for cystic fibrosis was discovered over 24 years ago. The promise of gene therapy as a cure for the disease has fizzled out, and while new antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals promise improved longevity and better quality of life, the average life span of a patient with cystic fibrosis is still at about 35 years. What are the prospects for gene therapy in the twenty-first century? Autoimmune diseases of the lung pose a different set of challenges, including the development of biomarkers to diagnose and monitor the disease and biological modulators to treat the disease.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Christopher","journal":"Clin Rev Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6eefcfc42c6ef523f7b3f7e3ef5fdc9a55c2125.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090922.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24293395/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-013-8399-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory diseases","Severe asthma","respiratory infectious diseases","heterogeneous disease","years","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Autoimmune diseases","vaccine development","developed world","development of new pharmaceuticals","promise of gene therapy","Respiratory syncytial virus","common chronic diseases","cystic fibrosis","care of patients","development of biomarkers","incidence of tuberculosis","developing world","deaths","significant public health problem","improved longevity","special problems","significant mortality","high health care costs","vaccine coverage","new antimicrobials","massive challenges","developed countries","better quality of life","average life span","different set of challenges","pertussis","lung","children","rest","morbidity","cure","treatment pathway","USA","phenotypes","endotypes","biological modulators","question","prospects","century","indication","spite"],"language":"en"},

We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pediatric pneumonia. METHODS: Between January 2012 and September 2013, we consecutively enrolled children aged 2\u201359 months with primary respiratory complaints at the outpatient clinics, emergency department, and inpatient wards of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Ni\u00F1o in Lima, Peru. All participants underwent clinical evaluation by a pediatrician and lung ultrasonography by one of three general practitioners. We also consecutively enrolled children without respiratory symptoms. Children with respiratory symptoms had a chest radiograph. We obtained ancillary laboratory testing in a subset. RESULTS: Final clinical diagnoses included 453 children with pneumonia, 133 with asthma, 103 with bronchiolitis, and 143 with upper respiratory infections. In total, CXR confirmed the diagnosis in 191 (42%) of 453 children with clinical pneumonia. A consolidation on lung ultrasound, which is our primary endpoint for pneumonia, had a sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92\u20130.97) when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. When any abnormality on lung ultrasound was compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia the sensitivity increased to 92.2% and the specificity decreased to 95.2%, with an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91\u20130.96). CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound had high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of radiographically-confirmed pneumonia. Added benefits of lung ultrasound include rapid testing and high inter-rater agreement.

It is highly necessary for healthcare providers (HCPs) to have sufficient knowledge about such a disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge regarding ZIKV among HCPs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, KSA, during a two-month period from September 19, 2016 to November 19, 2016. Descriptive statistics were performed on data collected. For continuous variables, data were expressed as means \u00B1 standard deviations (SDs), medians, and ranges. Proportions were used to describe categorical variables. Knowledge scores were evaluated and compared by demographic characteristics including age, designation, years of practice, and gender, using the t-test/Mann\u2013Whitney U test or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 336 HCPs from different specialties (physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists) completed the questionnaire. Significant differences in knowledge about ZIKV were observed by participant\u0027s age. Significantly higher knowledge levels were observed among older participants (45 years or more; p=0.011). A substantial difference in the knowledge level was observed by department, with pairwise comparisons showing significant differences in knowledge scores between all departments except for Pharmacy vs. Nutrition and Nursing vs. Internal Medicine. Knowledge scores were not significantly different by years of practice. CONCLUSION: Our study showed inadequate knowledge of HCPs from different specialties about ZIKV infection which needs to be improved in terms of infection prevention and control. Awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and maintained among HCPs to face any possible emergence in the region.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alessa, Mohammed; Alzahrani, Mohammed; Alshehri, Abdulmajeed; Aljrboa, Amjad; Bustami, Rami; Almangour, Abdullah; Alsalem, Abdulaziz; Gramish, Jawaher; Khobrani, Moteb; Almangour, Thamer A.","journal":"Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbfa58959569781edac533b6a37d56bac0f54b1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086415.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8145219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32256906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Knowledge scores","inadequate knowledge of HCPs","sufficient knowledge","ZIKV infection","higher knowledge levels","different specialties","years of practice","Wallis test","t-test","Riyadh","Significant differences","data","Whitney U test","cross-sectional survey study","terms of infection prevention","participant\u0027s age","categorical variables","continuous variables","Kruskal","Pharmacy","physicians","departments","Nursing","KSA","nurses","tertiary care center","dentists","Mann","designation","comparisons","older participants","SDs","medians","pharmacists","demographic characteristics","gender","total","Internal Medicine","standard deviations","healthcare providers","Saudi Arabia","nutritionists","control","major concern","possible emergence","BACKGROUND","Zika virus","substantial difference","CONCLUSION","world","region","ranges","Proportions","Descriptive statistics","RESULTS","disease","Awareness","month period","Materials","Methods","questionnaire","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, whether patients develop dyslipidemia is unknown. Objective In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC) in COVID-19 patients and their relationships with the disease severity. Methods A retrospective study was performed to examine serum levels of LDL-c, HDL-c, and TC on 597 COVID-19 patients (mild: 394; severe, 171; critical: 32) who were hospitalized in our center between February 1 and March 3, 2020. Age and gender-matched normal subjects (n=50) who had routine laboratory lipid tests between October 1 and November 1, 2019 in our center were included as the control group. Results LDL-c and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared with normal subjects (p\u003C0.001). There were significant and gradual decreases in levels of LDL-c (median (IQR) in mg/dL, mild: 91 (76, 104); severe 86 (69, 102); critical: 69 (48, 81); p\u003C0.02) and TC (mild: 173 (148, 203); severe 167 (138, 197); critical: 125 (95, 162); p\u003C0.05) across all three groups. HDL-c levels only decreased significantly in critical cases as compared to levels in mild and severe cases. LDL-c and TC levels inversely correlated with C-reactive protein and IL-6, and positively correlated with the number of lymphocytes in patients. Conclusions Development of hypolipidemia starts in patients with mild symptoms. It progressively becomes worse in an association with the disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Xiuqi; Zeng, Wenjuan; Su, Jingyu; Wan, Huimin; Yu, Xinqin; Cao, Xiaoling; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui","journal":"J Clin Lipidol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d54ff8c4779d97fbf75cc7b535f840953ac37002.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2020.04.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1933287420300787?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1933287420300787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","HDL-c levels","TC levels","Results LDL-c","serum levels of LDL","COVID","C-reactive protein","severe cases","mild symptoms","critical cases","disease severity","high-density lipoprotein cholesterol","total cholesterol","coronavirus disease","center","pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol","gender-matched normal subjects","retrospective study","gradual decreases","Age","Abstract Background","relationships","median","Conclusions Development of hypolipidemia","routine laboratory lipid tests","association","IQR","multiple organ dysfunctions","control group","Methods","number of lymphocytes","dyslipidemia","Objective","groups"],"language":"en"},

In virus-infected cells, MHV nsp15 distributed unevenly throughout the cytoplasm but predominantly in the perinuclear region. When expressed as N-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion, it predominantly formed speckles in the cytoplasm. In contrast, SARS-CoV and TGEV EGFP-nsp15s distributed smoothly in the whole cell and did not form speckles. Deletion mapping experiments identified two domains responsible for the speckle formation in MHV EGFP-nsp15: Domain I (aa101\u2013150) and Domain III (aa301\u2013374). Interestingly, Domain II (aa151\u2013250) had an inhibitory effect on Domain III- but not Domain I-mediated speckle formation. Expression of a small (35aa) sequence in Domain III alone was sufficient to form speckles for all 3 viral nsp15s. However, addition of surrounding sequences in Domain III abolished the speckle formation for TGEV nsp15 but not for MHV and SARS-CoV nsp15s. Further domain swapping experiments uncovered additional speckle-inducing and -suppressive elements in nsp15s of SARS-CoV and TGEV. Homotypic interaction involving Domain III of MHV nsp15 was further demonstrated biochemically. Moreover, the biological functions of the expressed nsp15s were assessed in MHV-infected cells. It was found that the effects of EGFP-nsp15s on MHV replication were both virus species- and nsp15 domain-dependent. Collectively these results thus underscore the differential biochemical and biological functions among the nsp15s of MHV, TGEV and SARS-CoV in host cells.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Jianzhong; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4883746a208514a779f3114d4e470efddf95b758.json; document_parses/pdf_json/72ee29ea11ac17bebba99d14a84950affea08777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539826.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22617024/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021200161X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021200161X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","Domain III","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp15s of MHV","MHV nsp15","nsp15s of SARS","MHV EGFP-nsp15","SARS-CoV nsp15s","TGEV EGFP-nsp15s","nsp15 domain-dependent","TGEV nsp15","MHV-infected cells","expressed nsp15s","MHV replication","viral nsp15s","virus-infected cells","virus species","mediated speckle formation","additional speckle","effects of EGFP","biological functions","host cells","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","mouse hepatitis virus","cytoplasm","formed speckles","biological properties of nonstructural protein","green fluorescence protein","Deletion mapping experiments","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","domains responsible","fusion","suppressive elements","N-terminal","Homotypic interaction","addition of surrounding sequences","contrast","aa101","inhibitory effect","Expression","perinuclear region","study","results","aa151","purpose","aa301"],"language":"en"},

We rely on potential variations in earthquake risk perceptions by floor level to assess whether the pricing of apartments in lower versus upper floors is consistent with a disproportionate fear of heights. We use a unique transaction dataset for new apartment units in the affected area. We find that the relative price of low to high floor units, particularly units located in the first and second floor, considerably increased for several months after the earthquake and then returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor. This temporal increase in relative prices is in line with a higher risk perception and fear, triggered after the earthquake, of living in upper floors, which gradually dissipated over time.

As a species more fragile than we often allow, humans would be expected to adversely react to these types of disasters in terms of mental ill-health and possibly suicidal behaviour leading to increased demands on the Mental Health services. This narrative historical paper examines relevant studies into how previous disasters affected mental health and suicidal behaviour. The characteristics of what is known of the current Covid-19 disease are analysed and compared to other types of disasters with a view to gaining some insight into what we might expect. Of all the types of disasters, economic recession appears most toxic. Mitigating the worst effects of recession appears to be protective. Particularly vulnerable groups are identified in whom we might expect an increase in suicidal behaviour.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devitt, Patrick","journal":"Irish journal of psychological medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434598/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.46","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of disasters","previous disasters","suicidal behaviour","Human disasters","Mental Health services","terms of mental ill-health","economic recessions","worst effects of recession","terrorist violence","natural events","relevant studies","wars","increased demands","depressions","shapes","sizes","narrative historical paper","view","current Covid","disease","infection","vulnerable groups","species","humans","insight","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Eosinophils have been studied as biomarkers of bacterial infection and prognostic factors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and AECOPD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether eosinophils could be used to determine bacterial infection in AECOPD events. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients admitted to Korea University Guro Hospital for AECOPD between January 2011 and May 2017. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, results of previous pulmonary function tests, treatment information during the admission period, and history of pulmonary treatment were collected before admission. Results: A total of 736 AECOPD events were eligible for inclusion and were divided into two groups based on the eosinophil count: those involving eosinophil counts of less than 2% (546 events) and those involving counts of 2% or more (190 events). In univariate analysis, the only bacterial pathogen identification events and bacterial-viral pathogen co-identification events were significantly more frequent in the group with eosinophil counts of less than 2% (P=0.010 and P=0.001, respectively). In logistic regression analysis, the rates of only bacterial pathogen identification [odds ratios =1.744; 95% confidence interval, 1.107\u20132.749; P=0.017] and bacterial-viral pathogen co-identification [odds ratios=2.075; 95% confidence interval, 1.081\u20133.984; P=0.028] were higher in the group with eosinophil count less than 2%. Conclusion: In conclusion, eosinophil counts of less than 2% are potential indicators of a bacterial infection in AECOPD events. Eosinophils could thus serve as a reference for the use of antibiotics in AECOPD treatment.","publish_time":"2019-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Juwhan; Oh, Jee Youn; Lee, Young Seok; Hur, Gyu Young; Lee, Sung Yong; Shim, Jae Jeong; Kang, Kyung Ho; Min, Kyung Hoon","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c5c841e4ad3fbf9b31d6c0c282dfec035f716bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6511627.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190782/; https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s197361","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Korea University Guro Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AECOPD events","bacterial pathogen identification events","AECOPD treatment","bacterial-viral pathogen co-identification events","counts","biomarkers of bacterial infection","eosinophil count","history of pulmonary treatment","Eosinophils","treatment information","use of antibiotics","treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","odds ratios","confidence interval","Conclusion","results of previous pulmonary function tests","admission period","univariate analysis","logistic regression analysis","prognostic factors","baseline characteristics","rates","Korea University Guro Hospital","medical records of patients","Data pertaining","clinician\u2019s experience","inclusion","total","potential indicators","judgment","groups","reference","study","Introduction","purpose","Methods"],"language":"en"},

No data are available on the efficacy of caspofungin as PAP in this setting. METHODS: Here, we report our retrospective experience with 103 consecutive patients treated with caspofungin as PAP after Haplo\u2010SCT. Caspofungin was administered only during the pre\u2010engraftment phase. RESULTS: Hundred\u2010day cumulative incidence of proven\u2010probable IFI (PP\u2010IFI) was 8.7% and median day of onset was 19 post\u2010SCT. No patient died of PP\u2010IFI, and overall survival (OS) and non\u2010relapse mortality (NRM) hazard ratio (HR) for patients experiencing IFI were 1.02 (P = 0.9) and 0.7 (P = 0.7), respectively. Three\u2010year overall survival (OS) and 1\u2010year non\u2010relapse mortality (NRM) were 55% and 19%, respectively. By univariate analysis, duration of neutropenic phase and partial remission pre\u2010transplant disease status were associated with increased incidence of IFI, but were not confirmed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In summary, PAP with caspofungin is an effective strategy for preventing IFI in the context of Haplo\u2010SCT with PT\u2010Cy. Further efforts are required in order to identify more potent strategies able to avoid the occurrence of breakthrough infections.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mariotti, Jacopo; De Philippis, Chiara; Bramanti, Stefania; Sarina, Barbara; Tordato, Federica; Pocaterra, Daria; Casari, Erminia; Carlo\u2010Stella, Carmelo; Santoro, Armando; Castagna, Luca","journal":"Eur J Haematol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a90d619d526e3b78effd53c1d5b4deeacbf0adf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163667.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAP","IFI","NRM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probable IFI","PAP","increased incidence of IFI","post\u2010SCT","efficacy of caspofungin","context of Haplo","NRM","PT","PP","year non\u2010relapse mortality","post\u2010transplant cyclophosphamide","pre\u2010engraftment phase","Three\u2010year overall survival","day cumulative incidence of proven","consecutive patients","univariate analysis","multivariate analysis","partial remission pre\u2010transplant disease status","duration of neutropenic phase","median day of onset","occurrence of breakthrough infections","replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation","high risk of invasive fungal infections","hazard ratio","active drug","primary antifungal prophylaxis","anti\u2010mold","potent strategies able","effective strategy","order","retrospective experience","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","summary","international guidelines","data","CONCLUSION","setting","efforts","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Five adult male emus were treated with a steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) induction protocol using combination of pulsed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). Additional three emus were used as normal control. Post-induction, emu gait was observed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and blood was collected for routine examination, including testing blood coagulation and lipid metabolism. Emus were sacrificed at week 24 post-induction, bilateral femora were collected for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis. Asymmetric limping gait and abnormal MRI signals were found in steroid-treated emus. SAON was found in all emus with a joint collapse incidence of 70%. The percentage of neutrophils (Neut %) and parameters on lipid metabolism significantly increased after induction. Micro-CT revealed structure deterioration of subchondral trabecular bone. Histomorphometry showed larger fat cell fraction and size, thinning of subchondral plate and cartilage layer, smaller osteoblast perimeter percentage and less blood vessels distributed at collapsed region in SAON group as compared with the normal controls. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed poor mineral matrix and more osteo-lacunae outline in the collapsed region in SAON group. The combination of pulsed LPS and MPS developed in the current study was safe and effective to induce SAON and deterioration of subchondral bone in bipedal emus with subsequent femoral head collapse, a typical clinical feature observed in patients under pulsed steroid treatment. In conclusion, bipedal emus could be used as an effective preclinical experimental model to evaluate potential treatment protocols to be developed for prevention of ON-induced hip joint collapse in patients.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Li-Zhen; Liu, Zhong; Lei, Ming; Peng, Jiang; He, Yi-Xin; Xie, Xin-Hui; Man, Chi-Wai; Huang, Le; Wang, Xin-Luan; Fong, Daniel Tik-Pui; Xiao, De-Ming; Wang, Da-Ping; Chen, Yang; Feng, Jian Q.; Liu, Ying; Zhang, Ge; Qin, Ling","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f86ac2580002e6b374ec325717eeee73e84af1c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3804596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24204675/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076797","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bipedal emus","steroid-treated emus","pulsed steroid treatment","prevention of steroid","SAON group","joint collapse incidence","adult male emus","induced hip joint collapse","Post-induction","steroid-associated osteonecrosis","bipedal animal model of steroid","micro-CT","induction protocol","deterioration of subchondral bone","potential treatment protocols","combination of pulsed LPS","subsequent femoral head collapse","subchondral plate","blood vessels","patients","combination of pulsed lipopolysaccharide","testing blood coagulation","collapsed region","lipid metabolism","MPS","structure deterioration of subchondral trabecular bone","effective preclinical experimental model","micro-computed tomography","emu gait","percentage of neutrophils","current study","preclinical settings","normal controls","abnormal MRI signals","Asymmetric limping gait","smaller osteoblast perimeter percentage","cartilage layer","typical clinical feature","bilateral femora","size","poor mineral matrix","larger fat cell fraction","SEM","osteo-lacunae","routine examination","week","magnetic resonance imaging","Histomorphometry","parameters","methylprednisolone","electron microscope","histological analysis","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia were observed in the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. Non-suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed. Regardless of the route of inoculation, all pigs infected experimentally with PTV showed a similar distribution of CNS lesions. Histological lesions in the CNS caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus were mild compared with those induced by intravenous infection. Immunohistochemically, the distribution of PTV antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions. PTV particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of PTV RNA in the CNS, tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated. Direct CNS invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for PTV. The gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of PTV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamada, M.; Miyazaki, A.; Yamamoto, Y.; Nakamura, K.; Ito, M.; Tsunemitsu, H.; Narita, M.","journal":"Journal of Comparative Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8872c8e69ad8ba0f3df7454eb8121c712e60011b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173091.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997513001370; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2013.08.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997513001370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","PTV RNA","PTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTV particles","distribution of PTV antigens","gnotobiotic pigs","similar distribution of CNS lesions","spinal cord of inoculated pigs","presence of PTV RNA","study of PTV pathogenesis","breeding pigs","distribution of brain lesions","spinal ganglion","intranasal inoculation","spinal root","route of inoculation","Histological lesions","Direct CNS invasion","endothelial cells of blood vessels","intravenous infection","cytoplasm of nerve cells","non-suppurative encephalomyelitis","Non-suppurative ganglionitis","major route of infection","perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells","focal gliosis","disorder","strain","Toyama","porcine teschovirus","neuronal necrosis","electron microscopy","useful model","neurological signs","neuronophagia","central nervous system","neuritis","tonsils","Polymerase chain reaction analysis","Summary","brainstem","large intestines","Japan","cerebellum"],"language":"en"},

This is essential for a more integrated understanding of overall viral fitness, with implications for disease management in the future.","publish_time":"2012-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wargo, Andrew R; Kurath, Gael","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b87abcd932d557711e3aa64ce8495b42fc4a13e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102723.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712001290; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.07.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712001290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22986085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replicative fitness","transmission fitness","vertebrate virus fitness","epidemiologic fitness","mathematical models of viral fitness","viral emergence","integrated understanding of overall viral fitness","influenza virus","Dengue virus","non-human vertebrate","major disease emergence events","recent work","disease management","broadening of research","RNA viruses","bacterial viruses","expanded number of human","active area of research","Important recent trends","immune escape","host jumps","quasispecies diversity","mutation effects","invertebrate","drug resistance","plant","systems","implications"],"language":"en"},

A locus located between the spike and envelope genes is conserved in all coronaviruses and contains a complete or truncated open reading frame (ORF). Previously, we demonstrated that this locus, which contains the gene for accessory protein 3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), encodes a protein that forms ion channels and regulates virus release. In the current study, we explored whether the ORF4a protein of HCoV-229E has similar functions. Our findings revealed that the ORF4a proteins were expressed in infected cells and localized at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast. Based on the measurement of conductance to different monovalent cations, the ORF4a was suggested to form a non-selective channel for monovalent cations, although Li\u002B partially reduced the inward current. Furthermore, viral production decreased when the ORF4a protein expression was suppressed by siRNA in infected cells. Collectively, this evidence indicates that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein is functionally analogous to the SARS-CoV 3a protein, which also acts as a viroporin that regulates virus production.

In some children acute cough progresses to chronic cough (\u003E4 weeks duration), impacting on morbidity and decreasing quality of life. Despite the importance of chronic cough as a cause of substantial childhood morbidity and associated economic, family and social costs, data on the prevalence, predictors, aetiology and natural history of the symptom are scarce. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children presenting to a tertiary paediatric emergency department. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of children aged \u003C15 years attending the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital Emergency Department, Brisbane, for a respiratory illness that includes parent reported cough (wet or dry) as a symptom. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence and predictors of chronic cough (\u22654 weeks duration) post presentation with acute respiratory illness. Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological and clinical data are completed at enrolment. Subjects complete daily cough dairies and weekly follow-up contacts for 28(\u00B13) days to ascertain cough persistence. Children who continue to cough for 28 days post enrolment are referred to a paediatric respiratory physician for review. Primary analysis will be the proportion of children with persistent cough at day 28(\u00B13). Multivariate analyses will be performed to evaluate variables independently associated with chronic cough at day 28(\u00B13). DISCUSSION: Our protocol will be the first to comprehensively describe the natural history, epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children. The results will contribute to studies leading to the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines to improve the early detection and management of chronic cough in children during and after acute respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drescher, Benjamin J; Chang, Anne B; Phillips, Natalie; Acworth, Jason; Marchant, Julie; Sloots, Theo P; David, Michael; O\u2019Grady, Kerry-Ann F","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f253bcc6991bacab2eb97fbea30c6e0e25bbf0de.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f1ac3f80abeb5681a1017fb3835a9b518d74551f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3766129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23947914/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-13-125","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Royal Children\u2019s Hospital Emergency Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children acute cough","outcomes of cough","persistent cough","cough persistence","predictors of chronic cough","management of chronic cough","importance of chronic cough","Acute respiratory illness","leading cause of cough","proportion of children","Subjects complete daily cough dairies","paediatric respiratory physician","aetiology","prospective cohort study of children","cause of substantial childhood morbidity","substantial proportion of childhood morbidity","prevalence","clinical data","weeks duration","natural history","epidemiology","days post enrolment","symptom","tertiary paediatric emergency department","clinical guidelines","post presentation","Primary analysis","primary objective","Royal Children\u2019s Hospital Emergency Department","Brisbane","risk factor","weekly follow-up contacts","family","years","early detection","accounts","social costs","parent","development of evidence","DESIGN","mortality","studies","METHODS","Demographic","review","variables","BACKGROUND","quality of life","Multivariate analyses","DISCUSSION","protocol","results"],"language":"en"},

The genetic change of this virus in specific populations over time is of great interest to understand the evolution and epidemiology of viruses. To facilitate the collections of HRV sequences over a number of years, a virology experiment was designed in which students test nasal lavage samples to look for HRV infection. Students will learn a variety of techniques including RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis as well as bioinformatic skills though examination of sequences from the HRV\u2010field isolates. Furthermore, students can look at symptom data from subjects to investigate correlations between symptom severity and factors such as stress and sleep patterns.

IFN-I promote anti-viral defense through two main mechanisms. First, IFN-I directly reinforce or induce de novo in potentially all cells the expression of effector molecules of intrinsic anti-viral immunity. Second, IFN-I orchestrate innate and adaptive anti-viral immunity. However, IFN-I responses can be deleterious for the host in a number of circumstances, including secondary bacterial or fungal infections, several autoimmune diseases, and, paradoxically, certain chronic viral infections. We will review the proposed nature of protective versus deleterious IFN-I responses in selected diseases. Emphasis will be put on the potentially deleterious functions of IFN-I in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, and on the respective roles of IFN-I and IFN-III in promoting resolution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We will then discuss how the balance between beneficial versus deleterious IFN-I responses is modulated by several key parameters including (i) the subtypes and dose of IFN-I produced, (ii) the cell types affected by IFN-I, and (iii) the source and timing of IFN-I production. Finally, we will speculate how integration of this knowledge combined with advanced biochemical manipulation of the activity of the cytokines should allow designing innovative immunotherapeutic treatments in patients. Specifically, we will discuss how induction or blockade of specific IFN-I responses in targeted cell types could promote the beneficial functions of IFN-I and/or dampen their deleterious effects, in a manner adapted to each disease.","publish_time":"2014-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomasello, Elena; Pollet, Emeline; Vu Manh, Thien-Phong; Uz\u00E9, Gilles; Dalod, Marc","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3156b64bff879eba0b2b9a0e81adc1c5dead42c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4214202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25400632/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deleterious IFN","timing of IFN","dose of IFN","deleterious functions of IFN","beneficial functions of IFN","blockade of specific IFN","respective roles of IFN","responses","anti-viral defense","deleterious effects","adaptive anti-viral immunity","certain chronic viral infections","expression of effector molecules of intrinsic anti-viral immunity","host defense","fungal infections","targeted cell types","cytokines critical","human immunodeficiency virus type","autoimmune diseases","selected diseases","resolution of hepatitis C virus","HCV","number of circumstances","HIV","advanced biochemical manipulation","proposed nature of protective","knowledge","cells","innovative immunotherapeutic treatments","activity","main mechanisms","patients","manner","years","subtypes","induction","balance","key parameters","integration","novo","source","production","interferons","Emphasis"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed clinical data and specimens from fourteen MERS patients treated in a hospital who collectively represent a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from mild febrile illness to fatal pneumonia, and classified the patients into four groups based on severity and mortality. Comparative and kinetic analyses revealed that high viral loads, weak antibody responses, and lymphopenia accompanying thrombocytopenia were associated with disease mortality, whereas persistent and gradual increases in lymphocyte responses might be required for effective immunity against MERS-CoV infection. Leukocytosis, primarily due to increased neutrophils and monocytes, was generally observed in more severe and fatal cases. The blood levels of cytokines such as IL-10, IL-15, TGF-\u03B2, and EGF were either positively or negatively correlated with disease mortality. Robust induction of various chemokines with differential kinetics was more prominent in patients that recovered from pneumonia than in patients with mild febrile illness or deceased patients. The correlation of the virological and immunological responses with disease severity and mortality, as well as their responses to current antiviral therapy, may have prognostic significance during the early phase of MERS.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, Chan-Ki; Cheon, Shinhye; Ha, Na-Young; Sohn, Kyung Mok; Kim, Yuri; Aigerim, Abdimadiyeva; Shin, Hyun Mu; Choi, Ji-Yeob; Inn, Kyung-Soo; Kim, Jin-Hwan; Moon, Jae Young; Choi, Myung-Sik; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Kim, Yeon-Sook","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58086bd6aa7a845eac58001de931144a3cebd644.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4857172.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS patients","disease mortality","deceased patients","immunological responses","lymphocyte responses","wide spectrum of disease severity","weak antibody responses","mild febrile illness","fatal pneumonia","early phase of MERS","MERS-CoV infection","ongoing spread of MERS","fatal cases","high viral loads","differential kinetics","prognostic significance","effective immunity","gradual increases","Robust induction of various chemokines","kinetic analyses","lymphopenia","thrombocytopenia","current antiviral therapy","factors","limited knowledge","specimens","hospital","clinical data","increased neutrophils","TGF-\u03B2","blood levels of cytokines","correlation","groups","Leukocytosis","monocytes","EGF","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

This elevated political priority is in many ways a welcome development for proponents of global health, and it has resulted in increased funding for and attention to select global health issues. However, there has been less examination of the tensions that characterize the relationship between global health and foreign policy and of the potential effects of linking global health efforts with the foreign-policy interests of states. In this paper, the authors review the relationship between global health and foreign policy by examining the roles of health across 4 major components of foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. For each of these aspects of foreign policy, the authors review current and historical issues and discuss how foreign-policy interests have aided or impeded global health efforts. The increasing relevance of global health to foreign policy holds both opportunities and dangers for global efforts to improve health.","publish_time":"2010-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feldbaum, Harley; Lee, Kelley; Michaud, Joshua","journal":"Epidemiol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67629939944591734aa3934d4a2c9aadf49ccedf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2898916.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423936/; https://doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxq006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health issues","proponents of global health","aspects of foreign policy","global efforts","impeded global health efforts","roles of health","increasing relevance of global health","foreign-policy interests of states","major components of foreign policy","foreign policies of states","legitimate issues","historical issues","relationship","authors","ways","trade","aid","potential effects","opportunities","dangers","welcome development","diplomacy","attention","highest levels of international politics","elevated political priority","recent years","national security","tensions","increased funding","paper","examination"],"language":"en"},

However, information about the relationship between viral infections and atopy among children whose attacks of wheezing lead to hospitalization is unclear. Objective To evaluate the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and to analyze the results in relation to the patient\u0027s age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission. Methods This was a case-control study of children (age 2 months to 18 years) admitted for wheezing to the University of Virginia Medical Center over a period of 12 months. Children without wheezing were enrolled as controls. Nasal secretions were evaluated for viral pathogens by using cultures, PCR tests, and antigen detection. Total IgE and specific IgE antibody to common aeroallergens was measured in serum. Results Seventy percent of children hospitalized for wheezing before age 3 years (n=79) were admitted between December and March, whereas 46% of children age 3 to 18 years (n=54) were hospitalized between September and November. Among children younger than 3 years, viral pathogens were detected in 84% (66/79) of wheezing children and 55% (42/77) of controls (P \u003C .001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the dominant pathogen during the winter months, but rhinovirus was more common during other months. Total serum IgE levels were generally low, and values from wheezing and control subjects overlapped considerably. Among children 3 years and older, 61% (33/54) of subjects admitted for wheezing tested positive for virus (predominantly rhinovirus), compared with 21% (12/56) of controls (P \u003C .001). The total serum IgE values among wheezing children (geometric mean, 386 IU/mL; 95% CI, 259-573) were substantially elevated compared with those of controls (geometric mean, 38 IU/mL; 95% CI, 26-56; P \u003C .001). A significantly higher percentage of wheezing children compared with controls was sensitized to at least 1 of the inhaled allergens tested: 84% (36/43) compared with 33% (15/45; P \u003C .001). The atopic characteristics of wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus were similar. Conclusions Viral infections were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before 3 years of age. By comparison, a large majority of the wheezing children age 3 to 18 years had striking atopic characteristics that may be critical as a risk factor for hospitalization and an adverse response to viral infections, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.","publish_time":"2004-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heymann, Peter W; Carper, Holliday T; Murphy, Deborah D; Platts-Mills, Thomas A.E; Patrie, James; McLaughlin, Anne P; Erwin, Elizabeth A; Shaker, Marcus S; Hellems, Martha; Peerzada, Jehanna; Hayden, Frederick G; Hatley, Tina K; Chamberlain, Rachel","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f739ce158fe0605ca31cd2b83e00abfba4c6823.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185400.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674904013119; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674904013119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["University of Virginia Medical Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wheezing children age","atopic characteristics of wheezing children","children younger","percent of children","higher percentage of wheezing children","years of age","attacks of wheezing lead","viral pathogens","controls","case-control study of children","Conclusions Viral infections","Total IgE","patient\u0027s age","prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens","Abstract Background Viral respiratory tract infections","total serum IgE values","rhinovirus","Total serum IgE levels","winter months","Respiratory syncytial virus","atopy","dominant risk factor","specific IgE antibody","hospitalization","geometric mean","IU","control subjects","results","dominant pathogen","common aeroallergens","adverse response","PCR tests","cultures","University of Virginia Medical Center","large majority","infants","period","relationship","antigen detection","season of admission","Nasal secretions","information","comparison","Methods","Objective","childhood","inhaled allergens"],"language":"en"},

IFN-independent, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) regulation in the context of CMV infection was first documented 20 years ago. Since then several IFN-independent, IRF3-dependent ISGs have been characterized and found to be among the most influential in the innate response to CMV. These include virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated IFN-inducible (viperin), ISG15, members of the interferon inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family, interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins and myxovirus resistance proteins A and B (MxA, MxB). IRF3-independent, IFN-independent activation of canonically IFN-dependent signaling pathways has also been documented, such as IFN-independent biphasic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) during infection of monocytes, differential roles of mitochondrial and peroxisomal mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), and the ability of human CMV (HCMV) immediate early protein 1 (IE1) protein to reroute IL-6 signaling and activation of STAT1 and its associated ISGs.

An Incident Command Center was established early in the crisis and helped identify electronic health record (EHR) based tools to support clinical care. RESULTS: We outline the design and implementation of EHR based rapid screening processes, laboratory testing, clinical decision support, reporting tools, and patient-facing technology related to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The EHR is a useful tool to enable rapid deployment of standardized processes. UC San Diego Health built multiple COVID-19-specific tools to support outbreak management, including scripted triaging, electronic check-in, standard ordering and documentation, secure messaging, real-time data analytics, and telemedicine capabilities. Challenges included the need to frequently adjust build to meet rapidly evolving requirements, communication and adoption, and coordinating the needs of multiple stakeholders while maintaining high-quality, pre-pandemic medical care.

Several lines of evidence suggest that T cell responses can control HPV infection. However, relative to other human viruses, strong effector memory T cell responses against HPV have been difficult to detect. We used an in vitro stimulation step prior to enzyme-linked immunospot assays to identify IFN-\u03B3-secreting T cells specific for HPV16 and 18 E6/E7 peptides. This allowed the detection of HPV-specific CD4(\u002B) T cells that were not evident in direct ex vivo assays. T cell responses against HPV16 or 18 peptides were detected in healthy volunteers (7/9) and patients with lower genital tract neoplasia (10/20). Importantly, this assay allowed tracking of vaccine-induced T cell responses in nine patients, following inoculation with a live recombinant vaccinia virus (HPV16 and 18 E6/E7, TA-HPV). Novel vaccine-induced T cell responses were demonstrated in five patients, but no clinical responses (lesion regressions) were seen. For one vaccinated patient, the T cell response was mapped to a single dominant HPV18 E7 epitope and this response was sustained for \u003E3 years. Our data suggest that systemic memory T cells against HPV16 and 18, induced naturally or by TA-HPV vaccination, are relatively rare. Nevertheless, the assay system developed allowed estimation of magnitude, epitope specificity, and longevity of vaccine-induced CD4(\u002B) T cell responses. This will be useful for vaccine design and measurement of immunological endpoints in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2004-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Kelly L.; Tristram, Amanda; Gallagher, Kathleen M.; Fiander, Alison N.; Man, Stephen","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bac1b661877e3efa730bc1ccd32fa88a376fa5be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Novel vaccine-induced T cell responses","strong effector memory T cell responses","clinical responses","systemic memory T cells","secreting T cells specific","HPV16","HPV infection","detection of HPV","patients","induced CD4","TA-HPV vaccination","longevity of vaccine","vaccine design","tracking of vaccine","E7 peptides","E6","specific CD4","lower genital tract neoplasia","single dominant HPV18 E7 epitope","malignant diseases","human viruses","epitope specificity","clinical trials","assay system","Persistent human papillomavirus","enzyme-linked immunospot assays","IFN-\u03B3","measurement of immunological endpoints","inoculation","live recombinant vaccinia virus","estimation of magnitude","type","stimulation step","data","vaccinated patient","lines of evidence","healthy volunteers","lesion regressions","direct ex","years"],"language":"en"},

Several viral/bacterial agents are responsible for BRD, and interactions occur among the agents. Viral agents often predispose animals to bacterial infections, and Mannheimia haemolytica is the most frequently isolated organism in cattle with BRD. Laboratory tests are available to characterize organisms causing BRD using easily obtained nasal swab samples. Testing for persistent infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus can be done by a 2-stage technique using PCR and immunohistochemistry. Preconditioning programs that include preweaning viral vaccination programs along with castration could have a significant influence on decreasing BRD in the cattle feeding industry. Metaphylactic antibiotic programs continue to be effective; however, antibiotic resistance is a public concern, and additional management options (e.g., direct-fed microbials or other compounds with antimicrobial properties) deserve attention. Diets with an increased energy concentration achieved by decreasing the dietary roughage concentration may slightly increase the rate of BRD morbidity; however, these diets also increase ADG, DMI, and G:F compared with lower-energy, greater-roughage diets. The extent to which performance and BRD morbidity are affected by dietary protein concentration needs further study, but low and high protein concentrations should probably be avoided. Several trace minerals (e.g., Cu, Se, and Zn) affect immune function, but the effects of supplementation on performance and immune function in model challenge systems and in field studies are equivocal. Adding vitamin E to receiving diets at pharmacological levels (e.g., \u003E1,000 IU\u00B7animal(\u22121)\u00B7day(\u22121)) seems beneficial for decreasing BRD morbidity, but it has little effect on performance.

We have found that substantial demyelination results from the focal inflammatory lesion caused by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 ng) directly into the rat dorsal funiculus. Within 24 h, such injections caused a focal inflammatory response consisting of a substantial number of polymorphonuclear cells and ED1-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive macrophages/microglia. The number of inflammatory cells was substantially reduced by day 7. OX-52-positive T-cells were less frequently observed but were present in the meninges at 8 h, reached a maximum in the dorsal funiculus at 7 days, and were rare at 14 days. The inflammation was followed by the appearance of a large lesion of primary demyelination that encompassed up to \u223C75% of the cross-sectional area of the dorsal funiculus. Treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced the number of cells expressing iNOS, but did not prevent the demyelination. By 28 days the lesions were largely remyelinated, usually by Schwann cells. These changes were not observed in control, saline-injected animals. We conclude that the intraspinal injection of LPS results in inflammation and subsequently in prominent demyelination. The mechanisms underlying the demyelination are not clear, but it is notable that it typically begins with disruption of the adaxonal myelin. Indeed, there is an early loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein within the lesion, despite the persistence of proteolipid protein. This combination is a feature of the pattern III lesion recently described in multiple sclerosis (Lucchinetti et al., 2000), and we therefore suggest that LPS-induced demyelination may serve as the first experimental model available for the study of this type of multiple sclerosis lesion.","publish_time":"2005-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Felts, Paul A.; Woolston, Anne-Marie; Fernando, Himali B.; Asquith, Stephen; Gregson, Norman A.; Mizzi, Oliver J.; Smith, Kenneth J.","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97a9e3baea51f98bf86d442616d998d328997b6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prominent demyelination","number of cells","Inflammation","large lesion of primary demyelination","number of inflammatory cells","substantial demyelination results","LPS-induced demyelination","focal inflammatory lesion","positive T-cells","Schwann cells","days","substantial number of polymorphonuclear cells","type of multiple sclerosis lesion","rat dorsal funiculus","ED1-positive","focal inflammatory response","positive macrophages","iNOS","intraspinal injection of LPS results","myelin damage","prominent feature","adaxonal myelin","early loss of myelin","injection of lipopolysaccharide","inducible nitric oxide synthase","study","associated glycoprotein","control","injections","pattern","relationship","appearance","disorders","experimental model available","saline-injected animals","disruption","microglia","cross-sectional area","dexamethasone","maximum","persistence of proteolipid protein","meninges","combination","Treatment","Lucchinetti","mechanisms","changes","lesions"],"language":"en"},

Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently described as a new member of the Parvoviridae family, and its possible association with respiratory illness in infants has been discussed. To date, HBoV genomes have been detected worldwide in respiratory tract samples obtained from children with pulmonary diseases, whereas only limited data on virus-specific immunity are available, mainly because of the lack of recombinant viral antigens. Methods. HBoV viruslike particles (VLPs) were produced in insect cells and characterized by electron microscopy and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. HBoV viral protein 2 (VP2)-specific antibodies and CD4(\u002B) T helper cell responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Results. VP2 capsid proteins of HBoV were produced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus, and the formation of icosahedral VLPs (diameter, 21\u201325 nm; sedimentation density, 1.33 g/cm(3)) was demonstrated. A significant increase in secretion of VP2-specific interferon-\u03B3 was detected in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 69 healthy adults found to be positive for HBoV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies, compared with control stimulations. In parallel, T cell responses against identically expressed parvovirus B19 VP2 VLPs were frequently observed in the individuals studied, without there being obvious cross-reactions between HBoV and parvovirus B19. Conclusions. Data suggest the presence of HBoV-specific immune responses in adults and strongly support a high prevalence of HBoV among humans.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindner, Juha; Zehentmeier, Sandra; Franssila, Rauli; Barabas, Sascha; Schroeder, Josef; Deml, Ludwig; Modrow, Susanne","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20d31d96fba3495838a4dd7abfade60707b0a8cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109795.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109795/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of HBoV","HBoV genomes","HBoV viral protein","HBoV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies","VP2 capsid proteins of HBoV","high prevalence of HBoV","HBoV viruslike particles","specific antibodies","specific immune responses","parvovirus B19 VP2 VLPs","secretion of VP2","insect cells","T cell responses","virus-specific immunity","specific interferon-\u03B3","T helper cell responses","enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay","enzyme-linked immunospot assay","formation of icosahedral VLPs","healthy adults","limited data","respiratory illness","recombinant baculovirus","lack of recombinant viral antigens","cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","respiratory tract samples","electron microscopy","possible association","CD4","pulmonary diseases","Parvoviridae family","cesium chloride gradient centrifugation","children","obvious cross-reactions","nm","infants","diameter","control stimulations","significant increase","new member","sedimentation density","humans","individuals","Human bocavirus","date","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV has been successfully isolated using various medium additives including trypsin, and although we know it is important for viral replication, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically investigated the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication including cell entry, cell-to-cell membrane fusion and virus release. Using pseudovirus entry assays, we demonstrated that PDCoV entry is not trypsin dependent. Furthermore, unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in which trypsin is important for the release of virus from infected cells, PDCoV release was not affected by trypsin. We also demonstrated that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by enhancing cell-to-cell membrane fusion. Most importantly, our study illustrates two distinct spreading patterns from infected cells to uninfected cells during PDCoV transmission, and the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication in cells with different virus spreading types. Overall, these results clarify that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by mediating cell-to-cell fusion transmission but is not crucial for viral entry. This knowledge can potentially contribute to improvement of virus production efficiency in culture, not only for vaccine preparation but also to develop antiviral treatments.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yue-Lin; Meng, Fandan; Qin, Pan; Herrler, Georg; Huang, Yao-Wei; Tang, Yan-Dong","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98a53ab5c12da91e1a7ff02c6df62ac9fc85ce41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7054919.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32090689/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1730245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV replication","PDCoV entry","PDCoV release","cell entry","PDCoV transmission","role of trypsin","trypsin dependent","cell fusion transmission","cell membrane fusion","virus release","release of virus","viral replication","different virus","viral entry","uninfected cells","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","improvement of virus production efficiency","pseudovirus entry assays","Porcine deltacoronavirus","global porcine industry","distinct spreading patterns","culture","emerging threat","PEDV","mechanism","vaccine preparation","various medium additives","study","types","results","antiviral treatments","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Host cell proteases that process the glycoproteins of these viruses are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The aspartyl protease signal peptide peptidase (SPP) has recently been shown to be required for processing of the glycoprotein precursor, Gn/Gc, of Bunyamwera virus and for viral infectivity. Here, we investigated whether SPP is also required for infectivity of particles bearing SFTSV-Gn/Gc. Entry driven by the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the Lassa virus glycoprotein (LASV-GPC) depends on the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/CatL) and the serine protease subtilisin/kexin-isozyme 1 (SKI-1), respectively, and was examined in parallel for control purposes. We found that inhibition of SPP and SKI-1 did not interfere with SFTSV Gn \u002B Gc-driven entry but, unexpectedly, blocked entry mediated by EBOV-GP. The inhibition occurred at the stage of proteolytic activation and the SPP inhibitor was found to block CatL/CatB activity. In contrast, the SKI-1 inhibitor did not interfere with CatB/CatL activity but disrupted CatB localization in endo/lysosomes, the site of EBOV-GP processing. These results underline the potential of protease inhibitors for antiviral therapy but also show that previously characterized compounds might exert broader specificity than initially appreciated and might block viral entry via diverse mechanisms.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plegge, Teresa; Spiegel, Martin; Kr\u00FCger, Nadine; Nehlmeier, Inga; Winkler, Michael; Gonz\u00E1lez Hern\u00E1ndez, Mariana; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57739f7172bb6dd11a63147d6bd37a3c227c7bc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6459477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973897/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214968","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPP","SFTSV-Gn/Gc","EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV glycoprotein","EBOV-GP","SFTSV-Gn","SFTSV Gn","CatB activity","Gc-driven entry","viral entry","SPP inhibitor","inhibition of SPP","SKI","Lassa virus glycoprotein","Ebola virus","Bunyamwera virus","CatL activity","site of EBOV","blocked entry","GP processing","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","disrupted CatB localization","potential of protease inhibitors","glycoprotein precursor","viral infectivity","serine protease subtilisin","potential targets","antiviral therapy","Emerging viruses","antiviral intervention","infectivity of particles","aspartyl protease signal peptide peptidase","Host cell proteases","cysteine proteases cathepsin B","severe fever","glycoproteins","endo","lysosomes","kexin-isozyme","LASV-GPC","stage of proteolytic activation","significant morbidity","characterized compounds","broader specificity","mortality","results","diverse mechanisms","control purposes","contrast"],"language":"en"},

This suggests that the DMVs could be a hallmark of laboratory-adapted HCV strains, possibly due to their ability to achieve a high level of replication. Alternatively, the concealment of viral RNA in DMVs may be part of innate immune response mechanisms particularly developed in hepatoma cell lines cultured in vitro. In any case, this constitutes the first report showing the differences in the membranous web established by HCV in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Roingeard, Philippe","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6262270.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells7110191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["observation of HCV","DMVs","induced membrane rearrangements","adapted HCV strains","double-membrane vesicles","Host cell membrane rearrangements","membranous web","report","innate immune response mechanisms","liver tissue","liver biopsy specimens","hepatoma cell lines","separate replication sites","high level of replication","cytoplasmic sensors","endoplasmic reticulum","hallmark of laboratory","patients","hepatitis C virus","lipid droplets","clusters of single","ability","concealment of viral RNA","differences","time","observations","studies","case"],"language":"en"},

Also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. I examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cloth against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GV against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the GV-dyed cloth were judged from viable cell counts. GV immediately killed the influenza A virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Moreover, cloth dyed with a combination of GV and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagayama, Ariaki","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dee5ba3548187f0cf5fed353431920b20072b69.json; document_parses/pdf_json/01484e627d675a380a4e531eae05865ea5f520f6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X06709473; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X06709473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GV-dyed cloth","combination of GV","pathogenic avian influenza virus","virus titer","vancomycin-resistant Enterococci","excellent antiviral activity","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","antiviral activity of gentian violet","killing activities","prominent bactericidal activities","consideration of bacterial infections","MRSA","MDRP","type-specific vaccines","anti-viral drugs","MICs","VRE","copper","use of face masks","effective protection methods","tissue culture infective dose","public health","TCID50","outbreak","H5N1","minimum inhibitory concentrations","viable cell counts","H1N1","serious concerns","warnings","electron microscopy","Time","studies"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells.

Metformin ameliorated the Th17 inflammaging profile by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geerdink, Ruben J.; Pillay, Janesh; Meyaard, Linde; Bont, Louis","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1735d2bf2120775db46e1803d1c92023d22e60d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112351.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674915009331; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2015.06.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915009331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral functions of neutrophils","RSV infection","pathologic contributions of neutrophils","severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis","pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils","development of asthma","Neutrophil-induced injury","site of viral respiratory tract infection","onset of asthma","effective antiviral adaptive immune response","Lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","airways of pediatric patients","lasting pulmonary impairment","inception of subsequent asthma","umbrella of antiviral treatment","pulmonary architecture","viral replication","delicate period of infant lung development","foremost cause of infant hospitalization","low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments","adverse consequences","viable future therapy","collateral tissue damage","vast numbers","susceptible subjects","infiltrated cells","review"],"language":"en"},

The amphibian XendoU participates in the biosynthesis of small nucleolar RNAs, the human PP11 is supposed to play specialized roles in placental tissue, and NendoU has critical function in coronavirus replication. Notably, XendoU family members have been implicated in human pathologies such as cancer and respiratory diseases: PP11 is aberrantly expressed in various tumors, while NendoU activity has been associated with respiratory infections by pathogenic coronaviruses. The present study is aimed at identifying small molecules that may selectively interfere with these enzymatic activities. Combining structure\u2010based virtual screening and experimental approaches, we identified four molecules that specifically inhibited the catalytic activity of XendoU and PP11 in the low micromolar range. Moreover, docking experiments strongly suggested that these compounds might also bind to the active site of NendoU, thus impairing the catalytic activity essential for the coronavirus life cycle.

Thus, we report here a prospective study in three herds of crossbred beef calves (n = 817) with endemic BCV. Serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-BCV antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of BCV and other common viral and bacterial BRD pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined times from birth through weaning. The calves were monitored for BRD and those that developed signs of respiratory disease were sampled for diagnostic testing. To discover additional risk factors that could have influenced BRD development, sequence analysis of the BCV strain(s) circulating in each herd, and the prevalence of common opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves (30.4%) were treated for BRD prior to weaning; 246 of those were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of BRD leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group. Molecular diagnostic testing found BCV and Histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of BRD treatment. Between herd analyses revealed anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of BRD or BCV shedding, though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections. Analysis of the BCV spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds, making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds. Persistent or recurrent shedding episodes of BCV occurred in some animals treated for BRD. CONCLUSION: Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens contributed to disease pathogenesis. Developing appropriate control measures for respiratory BCV infections may help decrease the incidence of pre-weaning BRD. The role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined.

Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembles of two rhinolophoid bats \u2013 the great leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros armiger) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Dong; Lei, Ming; Hua, Panyu; Pan, Yi-Hsuan; Mu, Shuo; Zheng, Guantao; Pang, Erli; Lin, Kui; Zhang, Shuyi","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05709268431159278ec479b683e1b929e936025e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27803123/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rhinolophoid bats","horseshoe bats","evolution of bats","great leaf-nosed bats","common ancestor of bats","Old World leaf-nosed bats","sensory gene","rhinolophoid bat lineages","sensory modalities","adaptation of auditory sensory perception","bat species","wide range of sensory systems","Chinese rufous horseshoe bat","auditory processing","extensive gene contractions","vision-related genes","sophisticated echolocation systems","patterns of evolution","extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires","genome sequencing","evidence of genetic adaptations","population genetic structure","Hipposideros armiger","similar sequence diversity values","high altitudes","little differentiation","future research","Rhinolophus sinicus","different geographical locations of China","useful resource","direct consequences","result","populations","Comparative genomic analyses","molecular changes","novo","extreme selectivity","work","Pseudogenization","branch","concordance"],"language":"en"},

This method uses a natural representation of genomic data by binary indicator sequences of each nucleotide (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)). Afterwards, the discrete Fourier transform is applied to these indicator sequences to calculate spectra of the nucleotides. Mathematical moments are calculated for each of these spectra to create a multidimensional vector in a Euclidean space for each gene or genome sequence. Thus, each gene or genome sequence is realized as a geometric point in the Euclidean space. Finally, pairwise Euclidean distances between these points (i.e. genome sequences) are calculated to cluster the gene or genome sequences. This method is applied to three sets of data. The first is 34 strains of coronavirus genomic data, the second is 118 of the known strains of Human rhinovirus (HRV), and the third is 30 bacteria genomes. The distance matrices are computed based on the three sets, showing the distances from each point to the others. We used the complete linkage clustering algorithm to build phylogenetic trees to indicate how the distances among these sequence correspond to the evolutionary relationship among these sequences. This genome representation provides a powerful and efficient method to classify genomes and is much faster than the widely acknowledged multiple sequence alignment method.","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Bo; Duan, Victor; Yau, Stephen S.-T.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7cc70fb203b538e8c319a0b07c099c137eaa6c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094093.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311001755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21443881/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.03.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311001755","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome sequences","genome representation","efficient method","Euclidean distances","multiple sequence alignment method","binary indicator sequences","novel clustering method","Euclidean space","sets of data","natural representation of genomic data","strains of coronavirus genomic data","spectra","bacteria genomes","geometric point","complete linkage clustering algorithm","known strains of Human rhinovirus","phylogenetic trees","guanine","HRV","adenine","multidimensional vector","points","thymine","cytosine","discrete Fourier transform","evolutionary relationship","genes","nucleotides","Mathematical moments","distance matrices"],"language":"en"},

These structures, termed replication organelles (ROs), have been well characterized for the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. However, it is unknown whether the diverse RO morphologies associated with enterovirus infection are conserved among other picornaviruses. Here, we use serial electron tomography at different stages of infection to assess the three-dimensional architecture of ROs induced by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of the Cardiovirus genus of the family of picornaviruses that is distantly related. Ultrastructural analyses revealed connections between early single-membrane EMCV ROs and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), establishing the ER as a likely donor organelle for their formation. These early single-membrane ROs appear to transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) as infection progresses. Both single- and double-membrane structures were found to support viral RNA synthesis, and progeny viruses accumulated in close proximity, suggesting a spatial association between RNA synthesis and virus assembly. Further, we explored the role of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a critical host factor for both enterovirus and cardiovirus replication that has been recently found to expedite enterovirus RO formation rather than being strictly required. By exploiting an EMCV escape mutant, we found that low-PI4P conditions could also be overcome for the formation of cardiovirus ROs. Collectively, our data show that despite differences in the membrane source, there are striking similarities in the biogenesis, morphology, and transformation of cardiovirus and enterovirus ROs, which may well extend to other picornaviruses.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melia, C.

Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon. Vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general, and for HIV/AIDS in particular, has been little successful. Certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive: they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them. For vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus, Dengue virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus, it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role. Other mechanisms may, either in the absence of or in combination with ADE, be involved. Consequently, vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines. Also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against HIV may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection. There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other. The present paper reviews the currently known mechanisms of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2009-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huisman, W.; Martina, B.E.E.; Rimmelzwaan, G.

The vascular endothelium is a central target for intervention, given its multiple roles in the physiology (in health) and pathophysiology (in disease) and its direct accessibility to circulating ligands. In cancer, the expression of specific molecules on the surface of vascular endothelial and perivascular cells might enable direct therapeutic targeting. The use of in vivo phage display has significantly contributed to the identification of such targets, which have been successfully used for directed vascular targeting in preclinical animal models. Several animal studies have been performed by using fused molecules between tumor endothelium-directed molecules and immunomodulatory, procoagulant, or cytotoxic molecules. In addition to delivery of therapeutic agents, vascular targeted gene therapies based on both ligand-directed delivery of gene vectors to tumor endothelium and transcriptional targeting have also emerged.

Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakalacheva, Kristina; M\u00FCnz, Christian; L\u00FCnemann, Jan D.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9e7f5a8995f8967153bfa9c2a37d99ecadd7a5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126972.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600868/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443910001225; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443910001225; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2010.06.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA","MHC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic susceptibility alleles","HLA class","genetic architecture","underlying susceptibility","MS development","HLA-DQ alleles","HLA-DR","experimental data","MHC class","environmental factors","robust susceptibility effects","permissive genetic trait","role of environmental risk factors","autoimmune diseases","highest-risk","Current data","experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation","non-MHC regions","role of viral pathogens","future perspectives","induced immunopathologies","human immunology research","chromosome 6p21","interaction","mechanisms of infection","substantial progress","past years","infectious triggers","translation","challenges","novel model systems","Collaborative efforts","infections","Multiple Sclerosis","review article","general population","genes"],"language":"en"},

Lynx populations have decreased dramatically in size and distribution in the last four decades, thus becoming increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic events such as epizooties. From 1989 to 2000, serum samples were obtained from 48 free-ranging lynx captured in the Do\u00F1ana National Park (DNP, n = 31) and mountains of Sierra Morena (SM, n = 17) in southern Spain. Samples were tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline/canine parvovirus (FPV/CPV), feline coronavirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) and for FeLV p27 antigen, to document baseline exposure levels. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 44% of lynx, with a significantly greater prevalence in DNP (61%) than in SM (12%). In DNP, prevalence was significantly higher in adult (81%) than in juvenile and sub-adult (41%) lynx, but no such difference was observed in SM. Low prevalences (\u226411%) of minimally positive titres were found for FHV-1, FCV and FPV/CPV. This, combined with the lack of evidence for exposure to CDV, FIV and FeLV, suggests that these lynx populations are na\u00EFve and might be vulnerable to a disease outbreak in the future. Because of the reduced size of lynx populations, the documented low level of genetic variation (particularly in the DNP population) coupled with the recently documented state of immune depletion in a majority of necropsied lynx, it is important to better understand the threat and potential impact that disease agents might pose for the conservation of this endangered species. Future surveillance programs must include possible disease reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs and other wild carnivores.","publish_time":"2007-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roelke, Melody E.; Johnson, Warren E.; Mill\u00E1n, Javier; Palomares, Francisco; Revilla, Eloy; Rodr\u00EDguez, Alejandro; Calzada, Javier; Ferreras, Pablo; Le\u00F3n-Vizca\u00EDno, Luis; Delibes, Miguel; O\u2019Brien, Stephen J.","journal":"Eur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb359c4e5e3fac4de4c881a6d5ba07baf9fe6aff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087597.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-007-0122-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sierra Morena","FPV/CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lynx pardinus","Iberian lynx","reduced size of lynx populations","majority of necropsied lynx","feline coronavirus","feline herpesvirus","feline calicivirus","feline leukaemia virus","feline immunodeficiency virus","DNP population","canine distemper virus","CDV","FIV","disease agents","disease outbreak","FHV","FPV","FCV","CPV","endangered species","antibodies","endangered felid species","possible disease reservoir hosts","canine parvovirus","Toxoplasma gondii","Low prevalences","greater prevalence","sub-adult","serum samples","documented low level of genetic variation","FeLV p27 antigen","Future surveillance programs","document baseline exposure levels","documented state of immune depletion","domestic cats","dogs","threat","Do\u00F1ana National Park","potential impact","mountains of Sierra Morena","conservation","wild carnivores","lack of evidence","catastrophic events","epizooties","world","difference","decades","juvenile","distribution","southern Spain","positive titres"],"language":"en"},

Given the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung cancer may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. During epidemic of COVID-19, a guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung cancer urgently needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and the side effects of antitumor drugs. This network questionnaire survey was conducted on the lung cancer group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association; the lung cancer group of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321 valid questionnaires were received. Based on the guidelines on lung cancer and the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was reached. During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments. Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC patients; An intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered according to patient performance status. Treatment strategies should be made according to different types of advanced NSCLC patients and efficacy and toxicity of drugs.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125132/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200221-00138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association","the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advanced lung cancer","symptoms of COVID","epidemic of COVID","lung cancer group","identification of COVID","different types of advanced NSCLC patients","antitumor treatments","higher risk of COVID","optimal management of patients","Chinese Thoracic Society","Chinese Medical Association","effects of antitumor drugs","intentional postponing of antitumor treatment","Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration","malignancy","infection","Treatment strategies","Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee","anticancer treatments","related symptoms","toxicity of drugs","valid questionnaires","nearest medical center","efficacy","public health emergency of major international concern","outpatients","results","adverse reactions","systemic immunosuppressive state","intensive attention","Stronger personal protection","network questionnaire survey","outbreak of coronavirus disease","guidelines","patient performance status","consensus"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3\u2019-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution.","publish_time":"2016-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Canping; Liu, William J.; Xu, Wen; Jin, Tao; Zhao, Yingze; Song, Jingdong; Shi, Yi; Ji, Wei; Jia, Hao; Zhou, Yongming; Wen, Honghua; Zhao, Honglan; Liu, Huaxing; Li, Hong; Wang, Qihui; Wu, Ying; Wang, Liang; Liu, Di; Liu, Guang; Yu, Hongjie; Holmes, Edward C.; Lu, Lin; Gao, George F.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f551bf91d2b52cadac39dbd62e7ae0f51066446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5038965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27676249/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005883","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus","known coronavirus","Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9","designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1","Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1","Ro-BatCoV HKU9","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pan-coronavirus RT-PCR","p10 gene","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bat orthoreovirus","segmented RNA virus","unique gene","positive-sense RNA virus","rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","new species","genome characteristics","cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses","genomics","insights","double","putative heterologous inter-family recombination event","cellular-level observations","International Committee of Taxonomy","Subgenomic mRNA","fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution","criteria","biodiversity","ICTV","formation of cell syncytia","homologs","striking","speciose order of mammals","generation sequencing","phylogeny analyses","end"],"language":"en"},

Identification of epitopes on the PEDV M protein will be helpful in the elucidation of the antigenic properties of this protein. RESULTS: One hybridoma cell line secreting anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (McAb) was generated and designated 4D4. To map the epitopes on the PEDV M protein, a total of 17 partially overlapping fragments covering the C-terminus of M protein were expressed as fusion proteins with a 6\u00D7His tag or a GST tag. A linear motif, (193)TGWAFYVR(200), was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis using McAb 4D4. The motif (195)WAFYVR(200) was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by removing amino acids individually from both ends of the motif (193)TGWAFYVR(200). The result of WB analysis showed that the 4D4-defined epitope could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, but not transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-positive serum. Furthermore, this epitope was highly conserved among different PEDV strains, as shown by alignment and comparison of sequences. CONCLUSION: A McAb, 4D4, directed against the M protein of PEDV, was obtained, and the 4D4-defined minimal epitope sequence was (195)WAFYVR(200). The McAb could serve as a candidate for development of a McAb-based antigen capture ELISA for detection of PEDV. The epitope identified provides a basis for the development of epitope-based differential diagnostic techniques and may be useful in the design of epitope-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhibang; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Xiaojin; Shi, Da; Feng, Li; Yang, Bin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f911fcc63f431561d8dc09ed831ce558ca2d773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST","WB","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of PEDV","McAb 4D4","4D4-defined epitope","detection of PEDV","development of epitope","protein monoclonal antibody","PEDV-positive serum","design of epitope","major structural protein of coronaviruses","different PEDV strains","minimal epitope sequence","designated 4D4","protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","McAb-based antigen capture ELISA","based vaccines","linear motif","TGWAFYVR","result of WB analysis","minimal requirement","GST tag","Identification of epitopes","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","hybridoma cell line secreting anti-","western blot","little information","TGEV","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","differential diagnostic techniques","formation of protective antibodies","overlapping fragments","RESULTS","alignment","C-terminus","elucidation","total","membrane","antigenic properties","reactivity","ends","BACKGROUND","candidate","basis","amino acids","fusion proteins","comparison of sequences","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo. PRINCIPLE FINDING: Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-\u03BAB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H(\u002B)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication. Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice.

Few studies have prospectively assessed viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections in community-based elderly individuals. We assessed viral respiratory pathogens in individuals \u226565 years with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal/throat swabs from 556 episodes of moderate-to-severe ILI, defined as ILI with pneumonia, hospitalization, or maximum daily influenza symptom severity score (ISS) \u003E2. Cases were selected from a randomized trial of an adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine conducted in elderly adults from 15 countries. Results. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 7.4% (41/556) moderate-to-severe ILI episodes in elderly adults. Most (39/41) were single infections. There was a significant association between country and RSV detection (P = .004). RSV prevalence was 7.1% (2/28) in ILI with pneumonia, 12.5% (8/64) in ILI with hospitalization, and 6.7% (32/480) in ILI with maximum ISS \u003E 2. Any virus was detected in 320/556 (57.6%) ILI episodes: influenza A (104/556, 18.7%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (82/556, 14.7%), coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (each 32/556, 5.6%). Conclusions. This first global study providing data on RSV disease in \u226565 year-olds confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in the elderly. Preventative measures such as vaccination could decrease severe respiratory illnesses and complications in the elderly.","publish_time":"2014-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falsey, Ann R.; McElhaney, Janet E.; Beran, Jiri; van Essen, Gerrit A.; Duval, Xavier; Esen, Meral; Galtier, Florence; Gervais, Pierre; Hwang, Shinn-Jang; Kremsner, Peter; Launay, Odile; Leroux-Roels, Geert; McNeil, Shelly A.; Nowakowski, Andrzej; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo; St Rose, Suzanne; Devaster, Jeanne-Marie; Oostvogels, Lidia; Durviaux, Serge; Taylor, Sylvia","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d28097d6542b0b34f34ca4d2359856cc461b5f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4038137.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex","ILI","RSV","ISS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe ILI episodes","elderly adults","elderly individuals","viral respiratory pathogens","severe respiratory illnesses","RSV detection","RSV disease","RSV prevalence","Respiratory syncytial virus","viral pathogens","episodes of moderate","viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections","important respiratory pathogen","maximum ISS","hospitalization","pneumonia","maximum daily influenza symptom severity score","adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine","single infections","nasal","Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","throat swabs","community","randomized trial","country","vaccination","years","global study","data","significant association","year-olds","complications","Preventative measures","coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","Cases","studies","countries","rhinovirus","enterovirus","Conclusions","Background","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Methods Four thousands and forty-eight healthy adults aged \u226518 years were randomized (1:1) to receive one dose of either the adjuvanted split virion (3.75\u03BCg hemagglutinin antigen [HA]/AS03) or non-adjuvanted (15\u03BCg HA) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody response was evaluated before vaccination and at Days 21, 42 and 182 (Month 6). Safety of the study vaccines was evaluated during the entire study duration. Results At Day 21, both study vaccines induced HI immune responses meeting the US regulatory criteria in subjects 18\u201364 years (seroprotection rate [SPR]: 98.0% [97.1\u201398.6]; seroconversion rate [SCR]: 89.7% [88.0\u201391.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 91.4% [89.9\u201392.8]; SCR: 74.6% [72.3\u201376.9] in the non-adjuvanted group) and \u003E64 years of age (SPR: 86.0% [82.5\u201389.0]; SCR: 75.3% [71.1\u201379.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 69.1% [64.6\u201373.3]; SCR: 56.7% [52.0\u201361.3] in the non-adjuvanted group). The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccine at all time points. At Month 6, only subjects 18\u201364 years of age from both vaccine groups still met the US regulatory criteria (SPR: 82.1% [80.0\u201384.1]; SCR: 62.3% [59.6\u201364.8] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 75.3% [72.9\u201377.5]; SCR: 53.7% [51.0\u201356.4] in the non-adjuvanted group). Protective efficacy was not evaluated due to low number of RT-qPCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza cases. Through Month 12, 216 serious adverse events (in 157 subjects: 84 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 73 in the non-adjuvanted group) and 12 potentially immune mediated diseases (5 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 7 in the non-adjuvanted group) were reported.

To expand current knowledge of the transcriptome and functional genomics in this species, a de novo transcriptome sequence analysis of young and mature leaf tissues of T. sinensis was performed using the Illumina platform. Over 8.1 Gb of data were generated, assembled into 64,541 unigenes, and annotated with known biological functions. Proteins involved in primary metabolite biosynthesis were identified based on similarities to known proteins, including some related to biosynthesis of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and energy. Analysis of unigenes differentially expressed between young and mature leaves (transcriptomic libraries \u2018YL\u2019 and \u2018ML\u2019, respectively) showed that the KEGG pathways of phenylpropanoid, naringenin, lignin, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis were significantly enriched in mature leaves. These results not only expand knowledge of transcriptome characteristics for this valuable species, but also provide a useful transcriptomic dataset to accelerate the researches on its metabolic mechanisms and functional genomics.

Methods We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real-time PCR. Results Of the 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 26 (31%) had diarrhea. The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P\u003C.05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69%) than from patients without diarrhea (17%) (P\u003C.001).

The global occurrence of exotic diseases, emerging and remerging pathogens, biological weapons, urbanization, and population explosion, decreasing crop yields, climatic changes, biodiversity loss, declining investments, and water scarcity remains a prevalent threat to sustainable agriculture, food security, and control. Proactive and dynamic strategies with stringent biosecurity measures are required to meet the challenge of Sustainable Development Goal 2 \u201Czero hunger\u201D adopted in the year 2015. Lapses in food and agricultural biosecurity measures can have an adverse impact on the health of people and may result in economic chaos. Awareness about biosecurity and bioterrorism has become more critical in recent years as terrorists are becoming more creative in their attack methods and targets. Food biosecurity strategies are essential to protect the food supply from intentional or accidental threats. Industrial and operational designs that inherently support biosecurity procedures should be employed in agriculture and livestock. Food security is a global issue. Substantial progress in food control and biosecurity will be dependent on our technical capacity, dynamic policies, awareness, and a global movement by involving the international regimes based on cooperation and collaboration.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khalil, Ali T.; Iqrar, Irum; Bashir, Samina; Ali, Muhammad; Khalil, Ali H.; Shinwari, Zabta K.","journal":"Food Safety and Preservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e5eca2182648529563ec932322bba413c0f115b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150240.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149560000032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149560000032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sustainable Development Goal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Food biosecurity strategies","food control","food supply","Abstract Food security","sustainable agriculture","biosecurity procedures","stringent biosecurity measures","agricultural biosecurity measures","keystones of sustainable development of society","challenge of Sustainable Development Goal","dynamic strategies","Awareness","global movement","global issue","population explosion","dynamic policies","human population","global occurrence of exotic diseases","biodiversity loss","climatic changes","declining investments","crop yields","prevalent threat","remerging pathogens","urbanization","water scarcity","healthy nutrition","biological weapons","technical capacity","adverse impact","international regimes","long-lasting well-being","recent years","terrorists","health of people","operational designs","accidental threats","hunger","bioterrorism","Substantial progress","Lapses","attack methods","targets","cooperation","collaboration","economic chaos"],"language":"en"},

The noticeable rise of MRSA and VRE was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, \u03B2-lactam\u2013\u03B2-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficient, P \u003C0.05). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of MRSA (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (in 1996\u20132003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/L of tigecycline, and all MRSA isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/L, including two isolates of MRSA with heteroresistance to vancomycin. Daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC90, 2mg/L) than against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC90, 4mg/L). Decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and MRSA to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. Telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (MIC90, 8mg/L).

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odd ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odd ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92). Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Liang, Yuxia; Wang, Yan; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Shanlu; Wu, Qianhui; Merler, Stefano; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Vespignani, Alessandro; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b07595b3a6bce87d1cb2a21afbc16599cc7643a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199529.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb8001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["COVID","infection","impact of social distancing","social distancing period","transmission model","years of age","outbreak","odd ratio","contact surveys data","China","contact tracing information","proactive school closures","place","Shanghai","patterns","susceptibility","Hunan Province","novel coronavirus disease","Intense non-pharmaceutical interventions","Wuhan","SARS-CoV","interactions","adults","interplay","individuals","questions","countries","dynamics","contrast","fold","Daily contacts","peak incidence","household","children","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

The cause of the decline of antibiotic development is multifactorial and currently most ICUs are confronted with the challenge of multidrug-resistant organisms. Antimicrobial multidrug resistance is expanding all over the world, with extreme and pandrug resistance being increasingly encountered, especially in healthcare-associated infections in large highly specialized hospitals. Antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patients translated into the implementation of specific guidelines, largely promoted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, targeted at education to optimize choice, dosage, and duration of antibiotics in order to improve outcomes and reduce the development of resistance. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, meaning the selection of an antibiotic to which the causative pathogen is resistant, is a consistent predictor of poor outcomes in septic patients. Therefore, pharmacokinetically/pharmacodynamically optimized dosing regimens should be given to all patients empirically and, once the pathogen and susceptibility are known, local stewardship practices may be employed on the basis of clinical response to redefine an appropriate regimen for the patient. This review will focus on the most severely ill patients, for whom substantial progress in organ support along with diagnostic and therapeutic strategies markedly increased the risk of nosocomial infections.

We aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in a selected population of young wheezers with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cut-off \u2265 10(4) colony-forming units/ml) was used. Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months, without structural anomalies of the conductive airways were evaluated. Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and Moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. All H. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus. Respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. Cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infection of the bronchial tree is common in persistent preschool wheezers and provides a possible explanation for non response to ICS therapy. Non-typeable H. influenzae seems to be the predominant pathogen involved, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis.","publish_time":"2012-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Schutter, Iris; Dreesman, Alexandra; Soetens, Oriane; De Waele, Marc; Crokaert, Fran\u00E7oise; Verhaegen, Jan; Pi\u00E9rard, Denis; Malfroot, Anne","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ab7d80bb6dc14cac7fe9c7d5a6060af434bef0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3420249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726254/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-12-83","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","H. haemolyticus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bacterial infection","bacterial isolates","bacterial bronchial infection","mixed bacterial-viral infection","Significant bacterial BAL cultures","ICS therapy","influenzae isolates","quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid","response","Young children","Haemophilus influenzae","predominant pathogens","persistent preschool wheezers","non-encapsulated strains","conventional asthma therapy","Modern microbiological methods","persistent wheezing","possible reason","selected population of young wheezers","possible explanation","bronchial tree","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Moraxella catarrhalis","wide panel of pathogens","symptoms unresponsive","detection","contamination risk","flexible bronchoscopy","significance cut-off","corticosteroid","characterisation","therapeutical challenge","cytological findings","structural anomalies","bronchoalveolar lavage","BACKGROUND","cases","Cytology","marked neutrophilic inflammation","conductive airways","pediatrician","months","CONCLUSIONS","Procedural measures","colony","haemolyticus","Respiratory viruses","units","RESULTS","patients"],"language":"en"},

For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2\u002B) and PT at low concentrations (2 \u00B5M Zn(2\u002B) and 2 \u00B5M PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV\u2014thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn(2\u002B) across the plasma membrane\u2014we show that Zn(2\u002B) efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn(2\u002B) directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn(2\u002B) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2\u002B) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.","publish_time":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

Using WNVCp as bait for a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified that Hsp70 interacted with WNVCp. The interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was further substantiated using purified proteins. Deletion analysis of Hsp70 indicated that WNVCp could bind to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. The presence of WNVCp in the Hsp70-dependent folding system inhibited the refolding of \u03B2-galactosidase (\u03B2-gal), which showed that WNVCp might function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp in 293T cells was prevented by ectopic Hsp70, suggesting a negative regulatory role of Hsp70 on WNVCp.

NP swabs or nasal washes were obtained for viral culture and rapid antigen testing (RAT). Results Of 499 evaluable SVPCR array RP samples, 344 (69%) tested positive for at least 1 of the 21 tested organisms. The most commonly identified pathogen was rhinovirus/enterovirus (181/344 [53%]) for which no RAT exists at CHM. Of 344 positive specimens, 57 (17%) had at least 2 identified pathogens; 8 (2%) of these had 3. In 11% of patients, molecular testing detected pathogens or pathogen combinations requiring both contact and droplet precautions. Conclusion SVPCR array RP testing detected respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients with URI at rates higher than that of RAT and viral culture. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected, the study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions may be warranted to prevent health care-associated infection in pediatric inpatients with URI. Further studies will be needed to confirm these results.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGrath, Eric J.; Thomas, Ronald; Asmar, Basim; Fairfax, Marilyn R.; Lephart, Paul; Ameli, Jamal; Abdel-Haq, Nahed; Salimnia, Hossein","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b410384ce5b8336eb56b3e131a9929e2f71b033.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510664/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655313001107; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2013.01.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655313001107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URI","NP","RAT","CHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory pathogens","symptoms of URI","pediatric inpatients","droplet isolation precautions","droplet precautions","Conclusion SVPCR array RP testing","combined isolation precautions","Methods Pediatric patients","combined contact","molecular testing","pathogen combinations","identified pathogen","evaluable SVPCR array RP samples","array respiratory panel","upper respiratory infection","health care-associated infection","rapid antigen testing","nucleic acid testing","viral culture","Results","NP swabs","swab samples","positive specimens","tested organisms","small volume polymerase chain reaction","CHM","Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan","study findings","rates higher","nasal washes","fall","Background","rhinovirus","enterovirus","studies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Adenoid samples and middle ear washes (MEW) were obtained from children with OME associated with adenoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy and tympanostomy, and compared to those obtained from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery, as a control group. Specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, influenza virus, picornavirus, syncytial respiratory virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) and 5 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus) were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: 37 OME and 14 cochlear implant children were included in the study. At the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both OME and control patients. At the middle ear washes, however, a higher prevalence of bacteria was observed in patients with OME (p = 0.01). S. pneumoniae (p = 0.01) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0.022) were the bacteria responsible for this difference. Although total virus detection was not statistically different from controls at the middle ear washes (p = 0.065), adenovirus was detected in higher proportions in adenoid samples of OME patients than controls (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Despite both OME and control patients presented similar rates of viruses and bacteria at the adenoid, children with OME presented higher prevalence of S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis in middle ear and adenovirus in adenoids when compared to controls.

Motivated by the situation of small island nations, which will probably experience the introduction of pandemic influenza via just one airport, we examined the potential effectiveness of quarantine as a border control measure. METHODS: Analysing the detailed epidemiologic characteristics of influenza, the effectiveness of quarantine at the borders of islands was modelled as the relative reduction of the risk of releasing infectious individuals into the community, explicitly accounting for the presence of asymptomatic infected individuals. The potential benefit of adding the use of rapid diagnostic testing to the quarantine process was also considered. RESULTS: We predict that 95% and 99% effectiveness in preventing the release of infectious individuals into the community could be achieved with quarantine periods of longer than 4.7 and 8.6 days, respectively. If rapid diagnostic testing is combined with quarantine, the lengths of quarantine to achieve 95% and 99% effectiveness could be shortened to 2.6 and 5.7 days, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that quarantine alone for 8.7 days or quarantine for 5.7 days combined with using rapid diagnostic testing could prevent secondary transmissions caused by the released infectious individuals for a plausible range of prevalence at the source country (up to 10%) and for a modest number of incoming travellers (up to 8000 individuals). CONCLUSION: Quarantine at the borders of island nations could contribute substantially to preventing the arrival of pandemic influenza (or at least delaying the arrival date). For small island nations we recommend consideration of quarantine alone for 9 days or quarantine for 6 days combined with using rapid diagnostic testing (if available).","publish_time":"2009-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Wilson, Nick; Baker, Michael G","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd55c44a2d6e3ec7d067fd6c46d569e4cc869d70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2670846.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["border quarantine","consideration of quarantine","quarantine process","quarantine periods","lengths of quarantine","potential effectiveness of quarantine","days","optimal quarantine length","use of rapid diagnostic testing","released infectious individuals","release of infectious individuals","arrival of pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic plans","introduction of pandemic influenza","borders of island nations","situation of small island nations","detailed epidemiologic characteristics of influenza","community","presence of asymptomatic infected individuals","detailed guidelines","borders of islands","potential benefit","arrival date","border control measure","secondary transmissions","plausible range of prevalence","risk","airport","source country","relative reduction","modest number of incoming travellers","METHODS","considerations","Sensitivity analysis","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Among the therapeutic options available, long-acting corticosteroids are frequently used due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Although they may improve the clinical symptoms, they can lead to a progressive form of the disease that becomes refractory to treatment. Furthermore, their direct relationship with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known. Consequently, these drugs are controversial and not recommended for routine management of FCGS. Recombinant feline interferon-omega (rFeIFN-\u03C9) is an immunomodulatory compound. Recently, its daily oral administration has been shown to be successful in treating refractory cases of FCGS. This case study describes two clinical cases of type II DM complicated by FCGS. Both animals were calicivirus positive and they had been previously treated with long-acting corticosteroids, which may have been the major cause of DM. The two cats were treated with glargine insulin (Lantus, starting dose 1 IU/cat twice daily (BID)), achieving remission 10 and 18 weeks later respectively. Considering the difficulty with control of FCGS in these animals, an oral daily dose of rFeIFN-\u03C9 was started as an alternative to long-acting corticosteroids. In both cats oral clinical signs gradually improved and 60 days after the start of therapy the owners reported a significant relief of pain during mastication. According to the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first case report that describes the successful use of rFeIFN-\u03C9 in the management of FCGS in type II diabetic cats, in which long-acting corticosteroids are contraindicated.","publish_time":"2013-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leal, Rodolfo O; Gil, Solange; Brito, Maria TV; McGahie, David; Niza, Maria MRE; Tavares, Lu\u00EDs","journal":"Ir Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25742d7fc7e3a5dfd8af95c2dbc9731494d13e67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3816157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24153100/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-0481-66-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCGS","IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acting corticosteroids","control of FCGS","refractory cases of FCGS","rFeIFN-\u03C9","routine management of FCGS","clinical cases of type","oral daily dose of rFeIFN","cats oral clinical signs","clinical practice","clinical symptoms","daily oral administration","successful use of rFeIFN","diabetic cats","animals","common disease","case study","case report","Recombinant feline interferon-omega","Feline Chronic Gingivostomatitis Syndrome","owners","days","significant relief of pain","start of therapy","IU","Lantus","direct relationship","diabetes mellitus","glargine insulin","therapeutic options available","BID","mastication","alternative","progressive form","immunomodulatory compound","anti-inflammatory","immunosuppressive properties","remission","calicivirus positive","major cause of","treatment","difficulty","authors\u2019 knowledge","weeks","drugs"],"language":"en"},

Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host.

Therefore, this study was conducted to identify nursing students\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of infection prevention related to occupational exposure to Zika virus infection, and to identify correlations among the related variables. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 249 nursing students from 3 nursing colleges located in 3 Korean cities, with experience in hospital clinical practice. A questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of Zika virus infection was developed through a literature review and was subjected to pilot testing and validation. RESULTS: The level of infection-control knowledge for Zika virus was 54.5 of 100 points, and that of practice was 4.5 of 5 points. The infection-prevention attitude score was 4.4 of 5 points, and the risk-perception score was 2.3 of 5 points. Significant differences emerged in infection-prevention attitude toward Zika virus based on Zika virus vaccination intention. Additionally, practice and risk-perception scores differed significantly based on gender and Zika virus vaccination intention. Knowledge significantly correlated with attitude and attitude toward preventive behavior. CONCLUSION: Improvement in infection-control knowledge for Zika virus can help improve nurses\u2019 related attitudes, which in turn could promote effective practice. Considering the characteristics of nursing students, it is necessary to develop and apply an effective and viable education program related to the prevention of Zika virus infection.","publish_time":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Jeong Sil; Kim, Kyung M.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7205bc9976156b4e663ca5cd151f69c67ad49f27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102775.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034118301060; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034118301060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30049612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of Zika virus infection","prevention of Zika virus infection","risk perceptions of Zika virus infection","Zika virus vaccination intention","infection-control knowledge","level of infection","risk perceptions of infection prevention","infection-prevention attitude score","points","nursing students\u2019 knowledge","effective practice","nursing colleges","characteristics of nursing students","risk-perception scores","hospital clinical practice","nurses\u2019 related attitudes","related variables","practices","cross-sectional study","occupational exposure","gender","Korean cities","experience","turn","number of patients","hospitals","viable education program","literature review","Improvement","correlations","pilot testing","Significant differences","preventive behavior","CONCLUSION","validation","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","questionnaire"],"language":"en"},

Influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children, the elderly, pregnant and post-partum women, patients with co-morbidities and the immunocompromised. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the treatment of choice for influenza due to widespread resistance to the adamantanes. NAIs are efficacious for the treatment of influenza in ambulatory patients with mild illness, when initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. Early treatment with NAIs has been shown to reduce otitis media in children, and lower respiratory tract complications, resulting in antibiotic therapy, in adults. Evidence on the efficacy of NAIs for the prevention of influenza-related complications in at-risk populations, based on reviews of data from randomised trials is inconclusive. However, observational studies suggest that in hospitalised patients early treatment with NAIs has been associated with reduced mortality. NAIs should be initiated as soon as possible in patients at high-risk of influenza-related complications, with suspected or proven influenza, hospitalised patients and patients with severe or progressive disease. NAIs can be considered in previously healthy patients when therapy can be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. In previously healthy patients, the therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir is time-dependent, with maximal benefit observed when therapy is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. However, several observational studies suggest therapeutic benefit beyond 48 h, in hospitalised patients, severe disease, and patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women. NAIs should be considered in patients at high risk of influenza-related complications who present late. Further studies are needed to define the optimal timing of NAIs. Oseltamivir-resistant virus has been widely reported but is predominantly an issue in H1N1 seasonal influenza. Zanamivir-resistant influenza virus is rare, and inhaled or intravenous (IV) zanamivir is the treatment of choice in proven or suspected oseltamivir-resistant virus. Intubated patients with severe influenza can be treated with oseltamivir (suspension) administered via nasogastric tube. The commercial dry powder formulation of zanamivir should not be administered, via nebulisation, as it has been associated with ventilator malfunction and mortality. In intubated patients, when there are concerns about gastric absorption, IV zanamivir should be obtained under Emergency Investigational New Drug access schemes. Currently available evidence does not support the use of high-dose or extended-duration oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza, but does require further investigation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has not been shown to be superior to conventional management in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and should be considered as salvage therapy. Corticosteriods should not be used in the treatment of severe influenza as this has been associated with increased risk of mortality and bacterial superinfection.","publish_time":"2014-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rowe, Emily; Ng, Pei Yi; Chandra, Thiaghu; Chen, Mark; Leo, Yee-Sin","journal":"Curr Treat Options Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a9331dd19572777a7f5188820c6c3811410e6a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Investigational New Drug"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of influenza","healthy patients","Intubated patients","treatment of severe influenza","proven influenza","ambulatory patients","prevention of influenza","high-risk of influenza","high risk of influenza","hospitalised patients early treatment","Zanamivir-resistant influenza virus","H1N1 seasonal influenza","efficacy of NAIs","related complications","treatment of choice","high risk of complications","optimal timing of NAIs","severe disease","h of symptom onset","suspected oseltamivir-resistant virus","duration oseltamivir","therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir","increased risk of mortality","reduced mortality","antibiotic therapy","observational studies","salvage therapy","lower respiratory tract complications","pregnant women","therapeutic benefit","use of high","healthy individuals","commercial dry powder formulation of zanamivir","young children","self-limiting illness","short-term morbidity","significant morbidity","mild illness","maximal benefit","progressive disease","available evidence","post-partum women","acute respiratory distress syndrome","elderly","co-morbidities","Emergency Investigational New Drug access schemes","time-dependent","at-risk populations","reviews of data","randomised trials","otitis media","bacterial superinfection","dose","widespread resistance","conventional management","economic burden","suspension","issue","nasogastric tube","Neuraminidase inhibitors","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","adamantanes","ventilator malfunction","gastric absorption","adults","nebulisation","Corticosteriods"],"language":"en"},

Surfactant proteins\u2019 (SPs) changes could have a role in the reduced compliance but the matter is still unsettled. The aim of this study was to clarify the meaning of SPs changes during pneumonia in term newborns. METHODS: In 28 term ventilated newborns, 13 with pneumonia and 15 with no lung disease, we measured SP-B, SP-A, disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), and total phospholipids (PL) concentrations in tracheal aspirates at intubation and close to extubation. We also measured DSPC kinetics using (U-(13)C-PA)dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine. RESULTS: At baseline, SP-B, expressed as % of PL, was significantly different between the groups, being 3.5-fold higher in pneumonia than controls. Conversely, SP-A did not vary between the groups. At extubation, SP-B and SP-A concentrations had decreased significantly in newborns with pneumonia, while there was no significant change in controls. DSPC t(1/2) was significantly shorter in the pneumonia group (11.8 (5.5\u201319.8) h vs. 26.6 (19.3\u201363.6) h, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: In term newborns with pneumonia, SP-B increases with respect to PL, and DSPC is turned over at a faster rate. Disease\u2019s resolution is associated with the restoration of the normal ratio between SP-B and PL.

Since aminopeptidase A (APA)-deficient mice develop hypertension APA appears to be an essential enzyme in the control of blood pressure via degradation of AngII. The robust hypertension seen in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is due to activation of the RAS, and an accompanying decrease in kidney APA. Changes in APA have also been measured during the activation of the RAS in the Goldblatt hypertension model and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rat. The DSS rat shows an elevation in renal APA activity at the onset of hypertension suggesting a protective role against elevations in circulating AngII, followed by decreased APA activity with advancing hypertension. Changes seen in human maternal serum APA activity during preeclampsia are similar to changes measured in renal APA in the DSS rat model. APA activity is higher than during normal pregnancy at the onset of preeclampsia, and with advancing preeclampsia (severe preeclampsia) declines below that seen during normal pregnancy. Serum APA activity is also increased during hormone replacement therapy (HRT), perhaps in reaction to elevated levels of AngII. Thus, it appears important to consider the relationship among activation of the RAS, circulating levels of AngII, and the availability of APA in hypertensive disorders.","publish_time":"2007-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Shigehiko; Ishii, Masakazu; Hattori, Akira; Nomura, Seiji; Numaguchi, Yasushi; Tsujimoto, Masafumi; Kobayshi, Hiroshi; Murohara, Toyoaki; Wright, John W.","journal":"Heart Fail Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d415b068ab263711030a7e9f6db4bf637336a503.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dahl"],"organizations":["APA","RAS","DSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hypertension APA","renal APA activity","availability of APA","kidney APA","onset of hypertension","advancing hypertension","human maternal serum APA activity","RAS","etiology of hypertension","robust hypertension","degradation of AngII","levels of AngII","circulating AngII","onset of preeclampsia","advancing preeclampsia","Goldblatt hypertension model","DSS rat model","hypertensive rat","Changes","activation","severe preeclampsia","normal pregnancy","maintenance of normal blood pressure","important role","control of blood pressure","protective role","hypertensive disorders","renin-angiotensin system","Dahl salt-sensitive","declines","essential enzyme","elevations","deficient mice","HRT","hormone replacement therapy","effector peptide","accompanying decrease","minimal attention","reaction","relationship","SHR","aminopeptidase"],"language":"en"},

CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Our patient experienced nephrotic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus infection at 5 years of age. A diagnosis of IgA and IgG2 deficiency and SLE was made on the basis of severe proteinuria, hematuria, hypocomplementemia, high anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, and malar rash. However, these clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory features disappeared after the administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prednisolone. For the 5 years following the initial treatment for SLE, the patient experienced a number of infections and had a low serum total IgG level; she was eventually diagnosed with CVID.

The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates from the date of retransplantation were 85.7, 85.7, and 78.6%, respectively. The rates of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation, bile leakage and postoperative bleeding after retransplantation were higher than after primary transplantation. Among the three patients who died after retransplantation, the operative time, the rate of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation and the incidence of gastrointestinal complications were higher in comparison to the surviving patients. CONCLUSION: Pediatric retransplantation from a living donor is an acceptable procedure that could save the lives of recipients with failing allografts when organs from deceased donors are scarce. To ensure good results, it is essential to make an appropriate assessment of the cardiopulmonary function and the infectious state of the patients before Re-LDLT.","publish_time":"2017-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miura, Kohei; Sakamoto, Seisuke; Shimata, Keita; Honda, Masaki; Kobayashi, Takashi; Wakai, Toshifumi; Sugawara, Yasuhiko; Inomata, Yukihiro","journal":"Surg Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1070d5dd956e0c6b126e6a13ab666f67d0452a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101953/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liver"],"organizations":["Kumamoto University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Liver retransplantation","primary transplantation","retransplantation recipient","date of retransplantation","outcomes of pediatric retransplantation","liver transplantation","living donor","surviving patients","rates of re-laparotomy","rate of re-laparotomy","comparison","Re-LDLT","operative time","clinicopathological factors","prognostic factors","good results","year survival rates","bile leakage","postoperative bleeding","organs","failing allografts","graft failure","therapeutic option","incidence of gastrointestinal complications","infectious state","cardiopulmonary function","deceased donors","years of age","lives of recipients","appropriate assessment","children","acceptable procedure","Kumamoto University Hospital","blood loss","CONCLUSION","single center","study","characteristics","PURPOSE","aim","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved with autophagy in many diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the relationship between the miRNA expression and the autophagic activity of the AT-II cells in the pathogenesis of ALI and its molecular mechanism. A mouse model of ALI and AT-II cell injury was induced using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo and in vitro, and the expression of miR-34a and the autophagy-related proteins LC3 II/I and p62 were determined. Moreover, the autophagic activity was investigated after miR-34a overexpression and inhibition. The effects of miR-34a on its target gene, FoxO3, in regulating autophagic activity in AT-II cells were also determined. LPS induced autophagic activity and increased the expression of miR-34a in lung tissues and in AT-II cells. The in vitro results showed that the upregulation of miR-34a suppressed, whereas the inhibition of miR-34a promoted, autophagy in AT-II cells. Moreover, miR-34a could directly bind to the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the autophagy-related gene, FoxO3, to decrease its expression. In addition, the knockdown of FoxO3 expression inhibited the autophagic activity in AT-II cells. Together, this study suggested that miR-34a might suppress the excessive autophagic activity in AT-II cells via targeting FoxO3 to reduce the damage of LPS-induced ALI.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Lan; Zhou, Fangliang; Cheng, Lijuan; Hu, Mei; He, Yingchun; Zhang, Bo; Liao, Duanfang; Xu, Zhaojun","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb035d4e157400918bc09aafaa8153cceca65bbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cells","expression of miR","LPS induced autophagic activity","inhibition of miR","upregulation of miR","effects of miR","Excessive autophagic activity of alveolar type","induced ALI","knockdown of FoxO3 expression","miRNA expression","autophagy-related gene","pathogenesis of ALI","targeting FoxO3","autophagy-related proteins LC3","damage of LPS","mouse model of ALI","study","underlying molecular mechanism","cell injury","lung tissues","target gene","main causes of acute lung injury","untranslated region","lipopolysaccharide","relationship","addition","p62","miRNAs","results","overexpression","microRNAs","objective","diseases"],"language":"en"},

The CXC chemokine interleukin (IL)-8, is a potent neutrophil recruiting and activating factor and the detection of IL-8 in clinical samples from patients with these diseases has led clinicians to believe that antagonism of IL-8 may be a practicable therapeutic strategy for disease management. Work over the last decade has concentrated on both the molecular mechanisms by which IL-8 is produced in the inflammatory setting and also on the manner in which IL-8 activates the neutrophil. Expression of the IL-8 gene appears to be controlled by several components of the inflammatory milieu. Whilst lipopolysaccharide, IL-1\u03B2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 are capable of augmenting IL-8 production, IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of IL-8 synthesis and appears to play an auto-regulatory role. Regulation of the IL-8 gene is under the control of nuclear factor \u03BAB which appears to be a primary target for corticosteroid-mediated repression of IL-8 production. IL-8 exerts is effects on neutrophils by binding with high affinity to two receptors on its cell surface, the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. These closely related receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors, proteins that historically have proved amenable to antagonism by small molecules. The recent descriptions in the literature of highly potent small molecule antagonists of CXCR2 and their success in blocking in vivo trafficking of neutrophils suggest that antagonsim of IL-8 at the receptor level is a viable therapeutic strategy. Clinical trials of such compounds will ultimately provide crucial information currently lacking and will define whether or not IL-8 blockade provides future therapy in pulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2012-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pease, James E.; Sabroe, Ian","journal":"Am J Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0267688090041b062bc540979f8e3d88bc671ff7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102088.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antagonism of IL","detection of IL","antagonsim of IL","potent inhibitor of IL","capable of augmenting IL","corticosteroid-mediated repression of IL","related receptors","chemokine receptors CXCR1","disease management","inflammatory lung diseases","potent neutrophil recruiting","production","trafficking of neutrophils","inflammatory milieu","inflammatory setting","potent small molecule antagonists of CXCR2","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","practicable therapeutic strategy","viable therapeutic strategy","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","control of nuclear factor \u03BAB","small molecules","clinical samples","Clinical trials","CXC chemokine interleukin","acute respiratory distress syndrome","literature","cell surface","success","binding","high affinity","superfamily of G","receptor level","blockade","future therapy","primary target","compounds","proteins","patients","asthma","pathogenesis","synthesis","effects","clinicians","manner","recent descriptions","molecular mechanisms","auto-regulatory role","decade","crucial information","components","lipopolysaccharide","Expression","Regulation","Work"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological data, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical patterns, underlying illnesses, type of infection, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), number of episodes, coinfection, antimicrobial therapy, and evolution were analyzed. A total of 221 clinical samples from 204 patients were positive for Aeromonas spp. The mean age of the patients was 67.6 years. The main clinical form of presentation was gastrointestinal (78.4%).

According to the WHO definition, lymph nodes involved by NLPHL should have a nodular or nodular and diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells in a small cell background that reside in expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks; the LP cells must also have a distinct immunophenotypic profile. The LP cells are monoclonal B cells that are typically CD20, BCL6, CD79a, and CD45 positive and are CD30 and CD15 negative. In contrast, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) are typically positive for CD15 and CD30. However, in CHL, CD20 staining is variable, and CD15 staining may be absent in some cases. Thus, CD30 is often considered to be the most distinctive marker between CHL and NLPHL. In order to better assess CD30 staining in NLPHL, we reviewed 220 cases of NLPHL and found 21 cases that showed at least focal staining of the neoplastic cells for CD30. The CD30 staining was often faint, but occasionally strong, and typically was found only on a subset of the LP cells. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of these cases to determine whether they showed differences from typical CD30-negative NLPHL and found no significant difference with respect to clinical presentation, histology, other immunophenotypic features or outcome. In summary, we conclude that CD30 expression by LP cells in NLPHL can be seen and should not lead to a misdiagnosis of CHL. The presence of CD30-positive LP cells is not associated with other features of CHL or unusually aggressive behavior.","publish_time":"2011-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seliem, Rania M.; Ferry, Judith A.; Hasserjian, Robert P.; Harris, Nancy L.; Zukerberg, Lawrence R.","journal":"J Hematop","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0ef075386412f1d04945f2d06db61817eb8b13c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102138/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LP","The LP","CHL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD30 staining","positive LP cells","neoplastic cells","cases of NLPHL","presence of CD30","CD30 expression","typical CD30-negative NLPHL","CD15 staining","features of CHL","monoclonal B cells","CD20 staining","focal staining","immunophenotypic features","Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma","CD15 negative","immunohistochemical features","clinicopathologic features","Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma","CD45 positive","spectrum of Hodgkin lymphomas","distinct immunophenotypic profile","clinical presentation","distinct neoplasm","diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant","small cell background","follicular dendritic cell meshworks","histology","significant difference","respect","BCL6","differences","CD79a","definition","lymph nodes","contrast","outcome","aggressive behavior","distinctive marker","misdiagnosis of","summary","order","subset"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of babesiosis is based on identification of Babesia spp. on a peripheral blood smear. Babesiosis is usually mild in normal hosts, but it may be severe or even fatal in asplenic patients. Pulmonary manifestations are rare in babesiosis, but non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) is the most frequent manifestation. NCPE in babesiosis does not appear to be related to the degree of parasitemia or splenic function and its onset may be early or late. NCPE usually resolves rapidly with supportive treatment; it is rarely fatal.

Moreover, the severity of the organ involvement can vary considerably, representing a wide spectrum from the self-limited to severe. The mainstay of therapy has evolved from the traditional use of corticosteroids and oral immunosupressants to the newer targeted treatments with biologic agents.

Methylene blue (MB) has been a well-established pharmacologic therapy for VS. However, it has been known to cause dose-related toxicity.

Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO(2) and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest X-ray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.","publish_time":"2014-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marchi, P.; Uderzo, C.; Riva, A.; Rovelli, A.; Biagi, E.; Arrigo, C.; Marraro, G.; Masera, G.","journal":"Support Care Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b625e36e4c217d00e2343aebfd7b1ce3dbc71e7c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of PTE","treatment of initial PTE","negative chest X-ray","acute lymphoblastic leukemia","positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy","course of acute respiratory failure","leukemic children","thrombolytic treatment","thrombolytic therapy","specific therapy","negative CT scan","chest CT scan","PTE-related hypoperfusion","onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia","clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure","Pulmonary thromboembolism","ventilatory scintigraphy","intensive care support","intensive care anesthetist","intensive chemotherapy","clinical monitoring","experience","cases","serial registration of respiratory rate","cardiac rate","instrumental monitoring","hematology ward","pediatric hematology unit","spite","SaO","combination","normal cardiorespiratory parameters","hours","reliable diagnostic tool","start","assistance","need","presence","return","progression","mechanical ventilation","arteriography","relapse","pathology","authors","subintensive supervision","criterion","heparin prophylaxis","guidelines","body temperature","basis","success"],"language":"en"},

During mechanical ventilation, a total of 62 simultaneous determinations of the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and EVLW were performed. A significant correlation between EVLW and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (Spearman-rho correlation coefficient, \u20130.852; p \u003C 0.001) was observed. In all patients, a decrease in EVLW was accompanied by an improvement in oxygenation. Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in all patients and significantly correlated with EVLW during the intensive care unit stay (Spearman-rho correlation coefficient, 0.786; p \u003C 0.001). In conclusion, EVLW seems increased in patients with severe H1N1-induced respiratory failure and appears to be closely correlated with impairments of oxygenatory function.","publish_time":"2010-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasibeder, Walter R.; D\u00FCnser, Martin W.; Halabi, Milad; Brinninger, Gabriele","journal":"Wien Klin Wochenschr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8198633e07d861da5af59261119edd2bad7ead6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVLW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EVLW","patients","PaO","FiO","ratio","Spearman-rho correlation coefficient","significant correlation","severe H1N1","respiratory failure","mmHg","partial arterial oxygen pressure","severe influenza","fractional inspiratory oxygen","biphasic airway pressure","extravascular lung water","intensive care unit","total","prone positioning","PEEP","hourly intervals","Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels","simultaneous determinations","case series","combination","grave hypoxia","conclusion","mechanical ventilation","system","impairments of oxygenatory function","improvement","PICCO","decrease","days","oxygenation"],"language":"en"},

From March 1985 to July 2001, 79 consecutive SAA patients, 46 male and 33 female, with a median age of 22 (4\u201343) years, received 80 courses of transplantation. Cyclophosphamide and total body radiation were used for the conditioning regimen, and cyclosporine-A and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention. Patients were followed for a median of 39 months (from 8 days to 194 months). Myeloid and platelet engraftment occurred in a median of 15 (8\u201327) days and 18 (8\u201377) days, respectively. Three patients had primary and three patients secondary graft failure. Five patients (6.8%) had grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD in 73 evaluable patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 23 (34.8%) patients, with extensive stage in six. Only two patients had CMV disease. The projected 3- and 5-year overall survival rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method were 76.08 and 74.13%, respectively. Age at transplant, non-sibling donor, mononuclear cell dose, grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD, interval from diagnosis to transplant, and red blood cell and platelet transfusion before transplant were poor prognostic factors for overall survival by univariate analysis. Grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD was the only prognostic factor affecting overall survival after multivariate Cox regression analysis (P=0.040). In conclusion, SAA patients receiving HSCT have good long-term survival.

Studies have shown that the proportion of Tfr cells may increase during acute inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of Tfr cells in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We found that Tfr cells were significantly enriched in peripheral blood and in mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the onset of ARDS. Notably, Tfr cells represented the majority of Treg cells in the mini-BAL samples. Tfr cells also showed CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03B2 expression, but compared to the non-Tfr Treg cells, the CTLA-4 and IL-10 expression by Tfr cells were slightly reduced. Both Tfr cells and non-Tfr Treg cells suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u2212) T cells; however, the Tfr cells displayed slightly reduced suppression capacity. Subsequently, B cells were co-incubated with autologous Tfr cells or non-Tfr Treg cells. Interestingly, we found that the frequency of IL-10(\u002B) Breg cells was significantly higher following incubation with Tfr cells than with non-Tfr Treg cells, which suggested that Tfr cells were more potent at inducing IL-10(\u002B) Breg cells. Together, these results demonstrated that Tfr cells were a similar but distinctive subset of Treg cells. Given that Tfr cells were strongly enriched in ARDS patients, especially in the lung infiltrates, they may exert critical ameliorating effects in ARDS.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hongqiang; Zhou, Runv; Wang, Chunmei; Li, Yusheng; Zheng, Guizhen; Jiang, Sen; Dong, Tiancao; Bai, Jianwen; Xu, Shumin","journal":"Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ad5a17b757ad107e652b0cc19fe3cc0474ba2e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102368.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autologous Tfr cells","role of Tfr cells","proportion of Tfr cells","non-Tfr Treg cells","T cells","Breg cells","B cells","majority of Treg cells","distinctive subset of Treg cells","ARDS patients","onset of ARDS","inducing IL","frequency of IL","subset of T regulatory","T follicular regulatory","CTLA","mini-BAL samples","critical roles","acute inflammation","proliferation of autologous CD4","mini-bronchoalveolar lavage","critical ameliorating effects","reduced suppression capacity","TGF-\u03B2 expression","acute respiratory distress syndrome","germinal center responses","higher following incubation","immune environment","peripheral blood","lung infiltrates","CD25","lymph nodes","Foxp3","CXCR5","results","Studies","study"],"language":"en"},

During evolution, the ancestor FGF expands into multiple members by acquiring divergent structural elements that enable functional divergence and specification. Heparan sulfate-binding FGFs, which play critical roles in embryonic development and adult tissue remodeling homeostasis, adapt to an autocrine/paracrine mode of action to promote cell proliferation and population growth. By contrast, FGF19, 21, and 23 coevolve through losing binding affinity for extracellular matrix heparan sulfate while acquiring affinity for transmembrane \u03B1-Klotho (KL) or \u03B2-KL as a coreceptor, thereby adapting to an endocrine mode of action to drive interorgan crosstalk that regulates a broad spectrum of metabolic homeostasis. FGF19 metabolic axis from the ileum to liver negatively controls diurnal bile acid biosynthesis. FGF21 metabolic axes play multifaceted roles in controlling the homeostasis of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. FGF23 axes from the bone to kidney and parathyroid regulate metabolic homeostasis of phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone that are important for bone health and systemic mineral balance. The significant divergence in structural elements and multiple functional specifications of FGF19, 21, and 23 in cellular and organismal metabolism instead of cell proliferation and growth sufficiently necessitate a new unified and specific term for these three endocrine FGFs. Thus, the term \u201CFGF Metabolic Axis,\u201D which distinguishes the unique pathways and functions of endocrine FGFs from other autocrine/paracrine mitogenic FGFs, is coined.","publish_time":"2019-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaokun","journal":"Front Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8039da1d9042895eaca609527a67f21e3b66c4a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metabolic homeostasis of phosphate","FGF Metabolic Axis","FGF19 metabolic axis","broad spectrum of metabolic homeostasis","homeostasis of lipid","FGF21 metabolic axes","functions of endocrine FGFs","Heparan sulfate-binding FGFs","endocrine mode of action","paracrine mitogenic FGFs","pleiotropic roles","critical roles","multifaceted roles","binding affinity","multiple members","adult tissue remodeling homeostasis","functional divergence","cell proliferation","paracrine mode of action","multiple functional specifications of FGF19","population growth","ancestor FGF","divergent structural elements","fibroblast growth factor","bone health","parathyroid hormone","extracellular matrix heparan sulfate","significant divergence","specific term","organismal metabolism","energy metabolism","FGF23 axes","liver","embryonic development","family","ileum","calcium","kidney","vitamin D","interorgan crosstalk","systemic mineral balance","diurnal bile acid biosynthesis","unique pathways","transmembrane \u03B1-Klotho","glucose","coreceptor","evolution","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Among infectious agents, viruses pose a serious threat to public health and global economy because they are often difficult to detect and their infections are hard to treat. Since it is crucial to develop rapid, accurate, cost-effective, and in-situ methods for early detection viruses, a variety of sensors have been reported so far. This review provides an overview of the recent developments in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for detecting viruses and use of these sensors on environmental, clinical and food monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors for determining viruses are divided into four main groups including nucleic acid-based, antibody-based, aptamer-based and antigen-based electrochemical biosensors. Finally, the drawbacks and advantages of each type of sensors are identified and discussed.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ozer, Tugba; Geiss, Brian J.; Henry, Charles S.","journal":"J Electrochem Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/014d3511509d258f6935a9465d07e6cf2c998aef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106559/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["electrochemical sensors","Electrochemical biosensors","variety of sensors","type of sensors","early detection viruses","food monitoring","infectious agents","Infectious diseases","serious threat","global economy","public health","contaminated water","recent developments","situ methods","nucleic acid","overview","main groups","bodily fluids","antibody","advantages","antigen","death of humans","animals","infections","aptamer","drawbacks","review"],"language":"en"},

Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4. METHODS: The msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays. RESULTS: Full peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uwase, Juliette; Chu, Ruilin; Kassegne, Kokouvi; Lei, Yao; Shen, Feihu; Fu, Haitian; Sun, Yifan; Xuan, Yinghua; Cao, Jun; Cheng, Yang","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6db034174b9ff4bba246040650d30533d1e2e56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106901.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. o."],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ovale MSP4","ovale wallikeri MSP4","ovale curtisi MSP4","PowMSP4-immunized mice","anti-PowMSP4-specific","cellular immune responses","anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies","Plasmodium ovale species","PowMSP4 cells","msp4 gene","induction of immune responses","peptide sequences of PocMSP4","anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies","specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin","high antibody responses","PoMSP4 protein sequences","Plasmodium species","high immunogenicity","high IgG avidity","c mice","truncated PoMSP4 segments","lymphocyte proliferation assays","Plasmodium merozoite surface protein","splenocyte proliferation assays","immunized mouse groups","rPoMSP4","protein expression","wallikeri isolate","source of malaria burden","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","blood samples","effective vaccine","Recombinant proteins","kDa proteins","amplified products","blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate","broad immuno-specificity","Western blot","crucial roles","genomic DNA","polymerase chain reaction","reacting","study","conservation","domain","rPoMSP1","immunogenic peptides","epidermal growth factor","amino acids of","Open reading frames","urgent need","tropical regions","end","rPowMSP4 cross","carboxyl terminus","serious global infectious diseases","Findings","rPoAMA1","clinical isolates","protection","titres","patients","RESULTS","Infection","mutation","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","rPocMSP4","Escherichia coli","BALB","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport, and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1, and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Jiali; Zhuang, Xiaolei; Zhou, Jiangtao; Sun, Luyang; Wan, Huixue; Li, Huifeng; Lyu, Deguo","journal":"Tree Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e0d8239bb05a29c391a63bad05f4871f660c976.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. baccata"],"organizations":["ROS","MDA","MHX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cd uptake","root Cd","\u03BCM Cd","Cd-tolerant","Cd stress","Cd-susceptible","Cd-stressed","melatonin-mediated Cd allocation","Cd-induced ROS","Cd-exposed rootstocks","reduced leaf Cd accumulation","mitigated Cd toxicity","\u03BCM melatonin","aerial parts Cd accumulation","Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions","decreased Cd translocation factors","Exogenous melatonin treatment","leaf melatonin contents","endogenous melatonin production","potential roles of melatonin","MDA accumulation","detoxification","Malus plants","increased root","qingzhoulinqin","micromalus","baccata","restored photosynthesis","antioxidant concentrations","enzyme activities","key genes","enzyme activity","different apple rootstocks","induction of antioxidant defense system","growth","tissues","mRNA levels","PCR2","HMA4","NRAMP3","greater extent","photosynthetic pigments","MT2","NAS1","NRAMP1","HA7","biomass","transport","ABCC1","results","MHX"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we exposed animals to a mixture of dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that included TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (1-PeCDF), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF), octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF), 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77), 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), and 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB169). The mixture composition approximated the relative abundance of these compounds in foodstuff (L. S. Birnbaum and M. J. DeVito, 1995, Toxicology Vol. 105, pp. 391\u2013401). Following the work of Gray et al. with TCDD (1997, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology Vol. 146, pp. 11\u201320), we exposed time-pregnant dams on gestation day (GD) 15 at doses up to 1.0 \u03BCg TCDD toxic equivalency (TEQ)/kg and the development of offspring was monitored. This mixture significantly increased the time to puberty in both male and female offspring. At postnatal day (PND) 32 seminal vesicle weights were decreased; however, only ventral prostate weight was affected at PND 49 and no effects were seen at PND 63. In female offspring, the mixture caused dose-dependent increases in the incidence of vaginal thread. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was higher than with TCDD the comparable TEQ exposure. Based on the slightly lowered responsiveness to the mixture, we used 2.0 \u03BCg TEQ/kg to examine reproductive effects. This dose elicited the responses observed with 1.0 \u03BCg TCDD/kg. Results indicate that the mixture causes a similar spectrum of effects seen with TCDD and the slightly lowered degree of response based on administered dose appears to be due to decreased transfer of mixture components to the offspring. Thus, the use of the WHO consensus TEFs (M. Van den Berg et al., 1998, Environ. Health Perspec. 106, 775\u2013792) reasonably predicts the developmental toxicity of this mixture of dioxin-like PHAHs.","publish_time":"2003-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hamm, J.

We examined associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFITM3, TLR3, and CD55 genes and influenza clinical outcomes in Chinese. METHODS. A multicenter study was conducted on 275 adult cases of avian (H7N9) and pandemic (H1N1(pdm09)) influenza. Host DNA was extracted from diagnostic respiratory samples; IFITM3 rs12252, TLR3 rs5743313, CD55 rs2564978, and TLR4 rs4986790/4986791 were targeted for genotyping (Sanger sequencing). The primary outcome analyzed was death. RESULTS. IFITM3 and TLR3 SNPs were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium; their allele frequencies (IFITM3/C-allele 0.56, TLR3/C-allele 0.88) were comparable to 1000 Genomes Han Chinese data. We found over-representation of homozygous IFITM3 CC (54.5% vs 33.2%; P = .02) and TLR3 CC (93.3% vs 76.9%; P = .04) genotypes among fatal cases. Recessive genetic models showed their significant independent associations with higher death risks (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29\u20136.02, and aHR 4.85, 95% CI 1.11\u221221.06, respectively).

To estimate the degree of variation in mutation rates of RNA viruses and to understand the source of such variation, we studied the synonymous substitution rate because synonymous substitution is exempt from functional constraints at the protein level, and its rate reflects the mutation rate to a great extent. We estimated the synonymous substitution rates for a total of 49 different species of RNA viruses, and we found that the rates had tremendous variation by 5 orders of magnitude (from 1.3 \u00D7 10(\u22127) to 6.2 \u00D7 10(\u22122) /synonymous site/year). Comparing the synonymous substitution rates with the replication frequencies and replication error rates for the RNA viruses, we found that the main source of the rate variation was differences in the replication frequency because the rates of replication error were roughly constant over different RNA viruses. Moreover, we examined a relationship between viral life strategies and synonymous substitution rates to understand which viral life strategies affect replication frequencies. The results show that the variation of synonymous substitution rates has been influenced most by either the difference in the infection modes or the differences in the transmission modes.

Proteins have kept or gained their functions during molecular evolution. Their functions seem to be flexible, and a few amino acid substitutions sometimes cause drastic changes in function. In order to monitor and predict such drastic changes in the early stages in target populations, we need to identify patterns of structural changes during molecular evolution causing decreases or increases in the binding affinity of protein complexes. In previous work, we developed a likelihood-based index to quantify the degree to which a sequence fits a given structure. This index was named the sequence-structure fitness (SSF) and is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in the structural environment present in template structures. In the present work, we used the SSF to develop an index to measure the binding affinity of protein\u2013protein complexes defined as the log likelihood ratio, contrasting the fitness of the sequences to the structure of the complex and that of the uncomplexed proteins. We applied the developed index to the complexes formed between influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) and four antibodies. The antibody\u2013antigen binding region of HA is under strong selection pressure by the host immune system. Hence, examination of the long-term adaptation of HA to the four antibodies could reveal the strategy of the molecular evolution of HA. Two antibodies cover the HA receptor-binding region, while the other two bind away from the receptor-binding region. By focusing on branches with a significant decline in binding ability, we could detect key amino acid replacements and investigate the mechanism via conditional probabilities. The contrast between the adaptations to the two types of antibodies suggests that the virus adapts to the immune system at the cost of structural change.","publish_time":"2007-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watabe, Teruaki; Kishino, Hirohisa; de Oliveira Martins, Leonardo; Kitazoe, Yasuhiro","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32750ffbdd4f7ab6fc7fb722c7aa043feff1378f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107539/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HA receptor-binding region","molecular evolution of HA","antigen binding region of HA","binding ability","binding affinity of protein complexes","developed index","likelihood-based index","drastic changes","types of antibodies","patterns of structural changes","amino acid substitutions","amino acid preferences","long-term adaptation of HA","sequence-structure fitness","structural environment present","key amino acid replacements","molecular recognition phenomena","indispensable functions","SSF","present work","given structure","uncomplexed proteins","host immune system","cost of structural change","previous work","log likelihood ratio","strong selection pressure","interactions","decreases","early stages","mechanism","organic molecules","target populations","significant decline","template structures","virus","hemagglutinin","influenza","antibody","strategy","adaptations","examination","branches","sequences","degree","conditional probabilities","biological systems","contrast","order"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is difficult early in the illness, because its presentation resembles that of other nonspecific viral fevers, such as dengue. Dengue fever is endemic in many of the countries in which the large SARS outbreaks occurred in early 2003. Misdiagnosis may have serious public health consequences. We aimed to determine simple laboratory features to differentiate SARS from dengue. Methods. We compared the laboratory features of 55 adult patients with SARS at presentation (who were all admitted before radiological changes had occurred) and 147 patients with dengue. Features independently predictive of dengue were modeled by multivariate logistic regression to create a diagnostic tool with 100% specificity for dengue. Results. Multivariate analysis identified 3 laboratory features that together are highly predictive of a diagnosis of dengue and able to rule out the possibility of SARS: platelet count of \u003C140 \u00D7 10(9) platelets/L, white blood cell count of \u003C5 \u00D7 10(9)cells/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of \u003E34 IU/L. A combination of these parameters has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusions. Simple laboratory data may be helpful for the diagnosis of disease in adults admitted because of fever in areas in which dengue is endemic when the diagnosis of SARS needs to be excluded. Application of this information may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients presenting with nonspecific fever.","publish_time":"2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Earnest, Arul; Paton, Nicholas I.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/691a57b0df430602c13a0c40cdc2ca36b29a6798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IU/L."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of dengue","Dengue fever","diagnosis of SARS","predictive of dengue","possibility of SARS","simple laboratory features","large SARS outbreaks","diagnosis of disease","nonspecific fever","Simple laboratory data","adult patients","presentation","specificity","diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Multivariate analysis","platelet count","multivariate logistic regression","nonspecific viral fevers","white blood cell count","diagnostic tool","use of isolation rooms","IU","Misdiagnosis","serious public health consequences","countries","adults","areas","aspartate aminotransferase level","combination","platelets","sensitivity","illness","information","parameters","cells","radiological changes","Application","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

A total of 1474 nasal scraping specimens collected over a 20-month period were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of HBoV nucleic acid. Positive results were confirmed with a second polymerase chain reaction assay from a different genomic region. The medical records of patients with positive results were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Results. HBoV DNA was identified in 82 samples (5.6%). The peak rate of HBoV infection occurred during the period of March through May in both 2004 and 2005. Sixty-three percent of infected patients were \u003C12 months of age. The most common symptoms were cough, rhinorrhea, and fever. Other symptoms of interest included diarrhea and a \u201Cparoxysmal\u201D cough that was clinically suspected to be caused by Bordetella pertussis. Conclusions. HBoV DNA is commonly present in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

Their impact as a cause of respiratory tract disease in adults at risk for complications needs to be established. Methods. We prospectively assessed the clinical impact of coronavirus infection (excluding cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome) among hospitalized adults. All patients with respiratory disease for whom bronchoalveolar lavage was performed were screened by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the presence of all 4 HCoVs. Results. HCoV was identified in 29 (5.4%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens from 279 subjects (mean age, 51 years; 63% male). HCoV OC43 was identified most frequently (12 isolates), followed by 229E (7 isolates), NL63 (6 isolates), and HKU1 (4 isolates). In all, 372 (69%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were negative for bacteria, and 2 persons were coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Transplantation was the most common underlying condition. Of the 29 patients who had HCoV identified in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, 9 (31%) were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 22 (76%) presented to the hospital with acute respiratory symptoms, 16 (55%) presented with cough and/or sputum, 13 (45%) presented with dyspnea, 16 (55%) had experienced prior respiratory infection, and 18 (62%) had a new infiltrate that was visible on chest radiograph. The most frequent final diagnosis was a lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusions. The recently discovered HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infection.

Furthermore, the relatively low secondary attack rates for Lassa fever, the restriction of the area of endemicity to West Africa, and the infrequency of high-risk exposures make it unlikely that controlled prospective efficacy trials will ever be possible. Recommendations for postexposure use of ribavirin can therefore be made only on the basis of a thorough understanding and logical extrapolation of existing data.

We carried out protein chip array profiling analysis in an attempt to identify biomarkers that might be useful in monitoring the clinical course of SARS patients. Methods: We performed surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on 89 sera collected from 28 SARS patients, 72 sera from 51 control patients with various viral or bacterial infections, and 10 sera from apparently healthy individuals. Results: Nine significantly increased and three significantly decreased serum biomarkers were discovered in the SARS patients compared with the controls. Among these biomarkers, one (11 695 Da) was identified to be serum amyloid A (SAA) protein by peptide mapping and tandem mass spectrometric analysis. When we monitored the SAA concentrations longitudinally in 45 sera from four SARS patients, we found a good correlation of SAA concentration with the extent of pneumonia as assessed by a serial chest x-ray opacity score. Increased SAA occurred in three of four patients at the time of extensive pneumonia as indicated by high x-ray scores. Over the course of gradual recovery in two patients, as assessed clinically and radiologically, SAA concentrations gradually decreased. In the third patient, the concentrations were initially increased, but were further increased with superimposed multiple bacterial infections. SAA was not markedly increased in the fourth patient, who had low x-ray scores and whose clinical course was relatively mild. Conclusions: Protein chip array profiling analysis could be potentially useful in monitoring the severity of disease in SARS patients.","publish_time":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Timothy TC; Chan, Johnny WM; Cho, William CS; Yip, Tai-Tung; Wang, Zheng; Kwan, Ting-Lok; Law, Stephen CK; Tsang, Dominic NC; Chan, John KC; Lee, King-Chung; Cheng, Wai-Wai; Ma, Victor WS; Yip, Christine; Lim, Cadmon KP; Ngan, Roger KC; Au, Joseph SK; Chan, Angel; Lim, Wilina WL","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcbfcabedc85544a2fc81bd00dc95fb752cb6e0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Increased SAA","clinical course of SARS patients","control patients","SAA concentrations","sera","protein chip array profiling analysis","serum biomarkers","good correlation of SAA concentration","low x-ray scores","high x-ray scores","tandem mass spectrometric analysis","time of extensive pneumonia","course of gradual recovery","extent of pneumonia","superimposed multiple bacterial infections","serum amyloid","healthy individuals","serial chest x-ray opacity score","flight mass spectrometry","surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time","peptide mapping","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","attempt","Conclusions","new strain of coronavirus","severity of disease","Background","Methods","deaths","controls","Results"],"language":"en"},

Pathologic changes in response to viral infection might be reflected in proteomic patterns in sera of SARS patients. Methods: We developed a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Serum samples were grouped into acute SARS (n = 74; \u003C7 days after onset of fever) and non-SARS [n = 1067; fever and influenza A (n = 203), pneumonia (n = 176); lung cancer (n = 29); and healthy controls (n = 659)] cohorts. Diluted samples were applied to WCX-2 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen), and the bound proteins were assessed on a ProteinChip Reader (Model PBS II). Bioinformatic calculations were performed with Biomarker Wizard software 3.1.1 (Ciphergen). Results: The discriminatory classifier with a panel of four biomarkers determined in the training set could precisely detect 36 of 37 (sensitivity, 97.3%) acute SARS and 987 of 993 (specificity, 99.4%) non-SARS samples. More importantly, this classifier accurately distinguished acute SARS from fever and influenza with 100% specificity (187 of 187).

Using a genome-wide screening strategy, we identified the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) as a potential downstream target of the CaR. We show that PMCA2 expression in the mouse mammary gland increases during lactation and that PMCA2 is localized solely to the apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells. In milk from deafwaddler mice, which have mutations in the gene encoding PMCA2, calcium concentrations were reduced, confirming its importance in calcium transport into milk. Furthermore, in cultured primary and EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells, CaR stimulation up-regulated calcium-dependent ATPase activity in plasma membrane preparations. By small interfering RNA-mediated gene knockdown of PMCA2, we show that PMCA2 accounts for the preponderance of calcium-ATPase activity. We also show that reduction of CaR expression with small interfering RNA eliminates the ability of extracellular calcium to elicit an increase in calcium-dependent ATPase activity in EpH4 cell membranes. These results demonstrate that activation of the CaR increases PMCA2 activity in mouse mammary epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the regulation of transepithelial calcium transport by calcium in the lactating mouse mammary gland.","publish_time":"2007-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"VanHouten, Joshua N.; Neville, Margaret C.; Wysolmerski, John J.","journal":"Endocrinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1537ba0e1eb2b64f85f45367f16dc4e15d566a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preponderance of calcium","calcium concentrations","PMCA2 activity","PMCA2 expression","regulated calcium-dependent ATPase activity","plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform","ability of extracellular calcium","calcium-sensing receptor","regulation of transepithelial calcium transport","EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells","PMCA2 accounts","apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells","lactating mouse mammary gland","CaR stimulation","milk","reduction of CaR expression","small interfering RNA-mediated gene knockdown of PMCA2","plasma membrane preparations","EpH4 cell membranes","mechanism","increase","mutations","potential downstream target","importance","genome-wide screening strategy","activation","lactation","deafwaddler mice","results"],"language":"en"},

The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. RESULTS: Four key aspects of e-health literacy\u2014use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence\u2014were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSIONS: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes. To date, no comprehensive scale exists to assess e-health literacy levels among speakers of Arabic, particularly among people with NCD such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.","publish_time":"2018-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zakaria, Nasriah; AlFakhry, Ohoud; Matbuli, Abeer; Alzahrani, Asma; Arab, Noha Samir Sadiq; Madani, Alaa; Alshehri, Noura; Albarrak, Ahmed I","journal":"Int J Qual Health Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b5df906aa61d901a680a5b6c520aa6d62e33297.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["e-health literacy dimensions","e-health literacy levels","health information","Saudi e-health literacy scale","health outcomes","useful literacy dimensions","key aspects of e","Saudi patients","information technology","SeHL scale","Saudi Arabia","comprehensive scale","people","common dimensions","speakers of Arabic","cardiovascular diseases","key factor","translation process","research objective","non-communicable diseases","multidisciplinary team members","Saudis","relevant papers","evaluated items","diabetes","individuals","related interdisciplinary fields","Multiple workshops","order","global issue","media","world","NCDs","patient-education system","educational services","hypertension","usefulness","English","ages","RESULTS","disciplines","METHODS","date","confidence","CONCLUSIONS","articles"],"language":"en"},

CD147 is a unique protein in that it can function both at the cell membrane and after being released from cells where it continues to retain activity. Thus, the CD147 receptor functions through at least two mechanisms that include both cyclophilin-independent and cyclophilin-dependent modes of action. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-independent activity, CD147 homophilic interactions are thought to underlie its activity. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-dependent activity, cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may represent a novel means of signaling since cyclophilins are also peptidyl\u2013prolyl isomerases. However, direct evidence of catalysis has not been shown within the cyclophilin/CD147 complex. In this report, we have characterized the solution behavior of the two most prevalent CD147 extracellular isoforms through biochemical methods that include gel-filtration and native gel analysis as well as directly through multiple NMR methods. All methods indicate that the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains are monomeric in solution and, thus, suggest that CD147 homophilic interactions in vivo are mediated through other partners. Additionally, using multiple NMR techniques, we have identified and characterized the cyclophilin target site on CD147 and have shown for the first time that CD147 is also a substrate of its primary cyclophilin enzyme ligand, cyclophilin A.","publish_time":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlegel, Jennifer; Redzic, Jasmina S.; Porter, Christopher C.; Yurchenko, Vyacheslav; Bukrinsky, Michael; Labeikovsky, Wladimir; Armstrong, Geoffrey S.; Zhang, Fengli; Isern, Nancy G.; DeGregori, James; Hodges, Robert; Eisenmesser, Elan Zohar","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92cefccc0829b9f99ba8b3e33ffbdee973e9fb1c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f186944f45fec6916b431f95cb84275037b6d717.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2940942.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609006743; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2940942?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.05.080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609006743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19500591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD147 interactions","CD147 cyclophilin-independent activity","CD147 cyclophilin-dependent activity","CD147 complex","CD147 homophilic interactions","CD147 receptor functions","cyclophilin ligands","prevalent CD147 extracellular isoforms","cyclophilin target site","cyclophilin-dependent modes of action","primary cyclophilin enzyme ligand","extracellular cyclophilins","multiple NMR methods","biochemical methods","extracellular immunoglobulin","regard","solution behavior","multiple NMR techniques","gel-filtration","protein families","unique protein","native gel analysis","substrate","integral role","mechanisms","numerous diseases","expression","domains","novel means","prolyl isomerases","direct evidence of catalysis","cells","time","cell membrane","report","partners"],"language":"en"},

Genetic sequencing technologies are furthering our understanding of how human and pathogen genomic factors - and their interactions - contribute to individual differences in immunologic responses to vaccines, infections and drug therapies. Such understanding will influence future policies and procedures for infectious disease management. With the potential for tailored interventions for particular individuals, populations or subpopulations, ethical, legal and social implications (ELSIs) may arise for public health and clinical practice. Potential considerations include balancing health-related benefits and harms between individuals and the larger community, minimizing threats to individual privacy and autonomy, and ensuring just distribution of scarce resources. In this Opinion, we consider the potential application of pathogen and host genomic information to particular viral infections that have large-scale public health consequences but differ in ELSI-relevant characteristics such as ease of transmission, chronicity, severity, preventability and treatability.

COMMANDITAIRE: La Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 des obst\u00E9triciens et gyn\u00E9cologues du Canada. RECOMMANDATIONS: 1. Tous les h\u00F4pitaux devraient mettre en \u0153uvre des syst\u00E8mes de pr\u00E9vention des infections, afin de s\u2019assurer que des alertes au sujet des modifications que connaissent les facteurs de risque d\u2019exposition au SRAS ou \u00E0 d\u2019autres maladies transmissibles potentiellement graves sont communiqu\u00E9es sans tarder aux unit\u00E9s cliniques, y compris l\u2019unit\u00E9 de travail et d\u2019accouchement (III-C). 2. En pr\u00E9sence d\u2019une \u00E9closion de SRAS, toutes les patientes enceintes \u00E9valu\u00E9es ou admises \u00E0 l\u2019h\u00F4pital devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un d\u00E9pistage des sympt\u00F4mes et des facteurs de risque du SRAS (III-C). 3. \u00C0 leur arriv\u00E9e au sein de l\u2019unit\u00E9 de triage quant au travail, les patientes enceintes chez lesquelles la pr\u00E9sence du SRAS est soup\u00E7onn\u00E9e et probable devraient \u00EAtre plac\u00E9es dans une salle d\u2019isolement dot\u00E9e d\u2019un syst\u00E8me de ventilation \u00E0 pression n\u00E9gative comptant au moins six renouvellements d\u2019air \u00E0 l\u2019heure. Toutes les unit\u00E9s de travail et d\u2019accouchement offrant des soins \u00E0 des patientes chez lesquelles la pr\u00E9sence du SRAS est soup\u00E7onn\u00E9e et probable devraient disposer d\u2019au moins une salle dans laquelle ces patientes peuvent conna\u00EEtre leur travail et leur accouchement en toute s\u00FBret\u00E9, et ce, malgr\u00E9 la n\u00E9cessit\u00E9 d\u2019assurer un isolement a\u00E9rog\u00E8ne (III-C). 4. Dans la mesure du possible, le travail et l\u2019accouchement (y compris l\u2019accouchement op\u00E9ratoire ou la c\u00E9sarienne) devraient \u00EAtre pris en charge, dans une salle d\u2019isolement d\u00E9sign\u00E9e dot\u00E9e d\u2019un syst\u00E8me de ventilation \u00E0 pression n\u00E9gative, par du personnel d\u00E9sign\u00E9 disposant d\u2019une tenue de protection et d\u2019une formation sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9e en pr\u00E9vention des infections (III-C). 5. Tant l\u2019anesth\u00E9sie r\u00E9gionale que g\u00E9n\u00E9rale peuvent s\u2019av\u00E9rer ad\u00E9quates pour l\u2019accouchement des patientes atteintes du SRAS (III-C). 6. Les nouveau-n\u00E9s issus de m\u00E8res atteintes du SRAS devraient \u00EAtre isol\u00E9s au sein d\u2019une unit\u00E9 d\u00E9sign\u00E9e jusqu\u2019\u00E0 ce que leur \u00E9tat ait \u00E9t\u00E9 satisfaisant pendant 10 jours ou jusqu\u2019\u00E0 ce que la p\u00E9riode d\u2019isolement de la m\u00E8re ait pris fin. La m\u00E8re ne devrait pas allaiter pendant cette p\u00E9riode (III-C). 7. Une \u00E9quipe multidisciplinaire (comprenant des obst\u00E9triciens, des infirmi\u00E8res, des p\u00E9diatres, des sp\u00E9cialistes de la pr\u00E9vention des infections, des inhaloth\u00E9rapeutes et des anesth\u00E9siologistes) devrait \u00EAtre nomm\u00E9e au sein de chaque unit\u00E9 et \u00EAtre responsable de l\u2019organisation et de la mise en \u0153uvre des protocoles de prise en charge du SRAS de l\u2019unit\u00E9 (III-C). 8. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS ne devraient pas offrir leurs services aux autres patientes enceintes. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS devraient activement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une surveillance visant la fi\u00E8vre et d\u2019autres sympt\u00F4mes du SRAS. Ces personnes ne devraient pas travailler en pr\u00E9sence de tout sympt\u00F4me du SRAS se manifestant dans les 10 jours suivant une exposition \u00E0 un patient atteint du SRAS (III-C). 9. Tous les professionnels des soins de sant\u00E9, les r\u00E9sidents et les membres du personnel de soutien devraient b\u00E9n\u00E9ficier d\u2019une formation sur la prise en charge et le confinement des infections afin de pr\u00E9venir la propagation du virus du SRAS (III-A). 10.

It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The S and 3c genes of FCoV have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the S and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the S and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the S or 3c gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments.","publish_time":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"OGUMA, Keisuke; OHNO, Megumi; YOSHIDA, Mayuko; SENTSUI, Hiroshi","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40c0532640a8bb9d9a0aac07d017d5982af33fdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6068308.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.17-0704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["c genes of FCoV","Feline coronavirus","location of mutations","faecal samples of cats","feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity","tissues of cats","horizontal transmission of FCoVs","viral pathogenicity conversion","faeces","effusion samples","viral genome","virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus","animal shelter","effusions","remainder","multi-cat environments","candidates","mutational analysis","frequency","biotypes","veterinary hospitals","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

This review article focusses on the role of horses in maintaining the health of humans and the environment. Horses\u2019 impact on environmental health includes their influence on soil and the biodiversity of animal and plant species. Nevertheless, the effect of horses is not usually linear and several factors like plant\u2013animal coevolutionary history, climate and animal density play significant roles. The long history of the relationship between horses and humans is shaped by the service of horses in wars or even in mines. Moreover, horses were essential in developing the first antidote to cure diphtheria. Nowadays, horses do have an influential role in animal assisted therapy, in supporting livelihoods in low income countries and as a leisure partner. Horses are of relevance in the spillover of zoonotic and emerging diseases from wildlife to human (e.g., Hendra Virus), and in non-communicable diseases (e.g., post-traumatic osteoarthritis in horses and back pain in horse riders). Furthermore, many risk factors\u2014such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance\u2014threaten the health of both horses and humans. Finally, the horse is a valuable factor in sustaining the health of humans and the environment, and must be incorporated in any roadmap to achieve OH.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F6nker, Nelly Sophie; Fechner, Kim; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed","journal":"Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b942b33896ef3a059b4e8dca1e41e7b379c86ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157506.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32121327/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci7010028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of horses","health of humans","service of horses","effect of horses","environmental health","animal density","biodiversity of animal","animal coevolutionary history","animal assisted therapy","environment matters","OH","climate change","emerging diseases","influential role","long history","plant species","risk factors","horse riders","non-communicable diseases","livelihoods","post-traumatic osteoarthritis","low income countries","wildlife","influence","spillover of zoonotic","pain","soil","Hendra Virus","interference","significant roles","crucial concept","antimicrobial resistance","animals","relationship","leisure partner","Horses\u2019 impact","valuable factor","wars","relevance","review article","antidote","mines","diphtheria","roadmap"],"language":"en"},

To characterize chronic PEDV infection, the duration of infectious virus shedding and development of protective immunity was determined. On Day 0 (D0), a growing pig was challenged with PEDV and 13 contacts were commingled. On D7, 9 contact pigs (principal virus group (PG)), were selected, moved to a separate room and commingled with one sentinel pig (S1). This process was repeated weekly with S2, S3 and S4. The PG was PEDV-positive by PCR from D3-11, with some pigs intermittently positive to D42. Pigs S1 and S2 were PEDV-positive within 24 hours of commingling. Antibodies were detected in all PG by D21 and by 7 days post-contact in S1 and S2. Pigs S3 and S4 were PCR and antibody negative following commingling. To evaluate protective immunity, 5 na\u00EFve pigs (N) and the PG were challenged (N/C, PG/C) with homologous virus on D49. All N/C pigs were PEDV PCR-positive by D52 with detection out to D62 in 3/5 N/C pigs. All PG/C pigs were PEDV PCR-negative post-challenge. By D63, all N/C seroconverted. Although PEDV RNA was demonstrated in pigs after primary infection until D42, infectious PEDV capable of horizontal transmission to na\u00EFve pigs was only shed 14\u201316 days after infection to age-matched pigs. Homologous re-challenge 49 days post initial PEDV exposure did not result in re-infection of the pigs.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still\u2019s disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used.

This outcome suggests that air circulation due to the ceiling fan was sufficient and that any additional increase would not improve efficacy. Numerous experimental studies on upper-room UVGI in which fans were used to provide air mixing have been published. However, none have quantified the air movement produced by these fans or described their tests in sufficient detail to allow results to be compared to predictions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The present work provides the required information. In addition to the usual boundary conditions needed for CFD, we made experimental measurements of UV susceptibility of the microorganisms used in the upper-room UVGI tests. We measured UV susceptibilities for Mycobacterium parafortuitum and Bacillus atrophaeus spores to be 0.074 and 0.018 m2/J, respectively. In a previous publication, we reported the spatial distribution of fluence rate, which is also needed for predicting efficacy from CFD. In a companion paper referred to as Part II, upper-room UVGI efficacy was predicted by both Eulerian and Lagrangian CFD and compared to the experimental results from the present study.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudnick, S.

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life-years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features\u2014measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach\u2014augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing \u201Chedonic\u201D value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phelps, Charles E.; Lakdawalla, Darius N.; Basu, Anirban; Drummond, Michael F.; Towse, Adrian; Danzon, Patricia M.","journal":"Value in Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5719f6793a83d07462521f608b01fe66efeb6500.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110784.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301517338950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29477392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301517338950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measures of value","value measures","multiple elements of value","value frameworks","comprehensive measure of value","single value metric","multicriteria decision analysis","measures of quality","additional elements","benefit plan decision","population level","plan-level decisions","benefit information","individuals","aggregation issues","ECEA","use quantitative information","measures of financial risk protection","extended cost-effectiveness analysis","aggregation of cost","group decisions","important approach","augmented CEA","use of stated preference methods","deliberative processes","good example","deliberative voting process","income distributional consequences","features","prioritization","Special Task Force report","health technology assessment bodies","section","technique","adjusted life-years","broader concept of utility","recommendations","option","budget","area","approaches"],"language":"en"},

HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6\u201335 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication. The important role of HBoV1 on AOM pathogenesis needs to be studied further.","publish_time":"2013-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Pyles, Richard B.; Miller, Aaron L.; Jennings, Kristofer; Loeffelholz, Michael; Chonmaitree, Tasnee","journal":"Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be4538c4a50fdb2d523e34ec64294beb8904456b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4865000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26625362/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pit061; https://academic.oup.com/jpids/article-pdf/3/2/98/9948138/pit061.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AOM","NPS","URI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV1-URI","URI episodes","significance of HBoV1","HBoV1 DNA","rate of AOM","AOM complication","respiratory infections","AOM pathogenesis","single respiratory virus","important role of HBoV1","higher AOM rate","broad spectrum of respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract infections","single virus","healthy children","NPS samples","Archived NPS","specimens","rate of detection","high-throughput","quantitative polymerase chain reaction method","acute otitis media","relation","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","METHODS","Nasopharyngeal secretions","months","knowledge","described parvovirus","year","study","CONCLUSIONS","objective","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

We review our experiences with investigating the prenatal effects of two mosquito\u2010borne infections that emerged in the past 2 decades, West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus. Concerns regarding teratogenicity were raised about both viruses; Zika virus has been confirmed to be teratogenic, while WNV appears not to increase the risk for adverse outcomes, although teratogenicity has not been excluded. Study designs used to examine the effects of both viruses include case reports and series, pregnancy registries, and cohort studies. Case\u2013control studies and birth defects surveillance systems are being used to study the effects during pregnancy of Zika virus, but not the effects of WNV, because a specific phenotype was observed among infants with congenital Zika infection, but not among infants with congenital WNV infection. Experimental data that demonstrated that Zika virus was neurotropic have also been useful because they provided biologic plausibility for Zika virus\u0027s teratogenic effects: these findings were consistent with observations in congenitally infected infants. Challenges encountered with studies to evaluate the effects of these infections include the broad range of possible adverse outcomes, the inability to include all infected pregnant women in studies because many infections are asymptomatic, and the difficulty with interpretation of diagnostic testing of infants (WNV and Zika) and pregnant women (Zika).

This study provides the first evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of \u03B17nAChR agonists in COPD due to their ability to suppress with the production of key inflammatory markers associated with disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Douaoui, Sana; Djidjik, Reda; Boubakeur, Mokhtar; Ghernaout, Merzak; Touil-boukoffa, Chafia; Oumouna, Mustapha; Derrar, Fawzi; Amrani, Yassine","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb3d06ccb4345ec5353852b340cf92a43adeb928.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2020.151950; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298520301261?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387130/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298520301261","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of IL","PBMCs of COPD patients","lung inflammatory disease","plasma of patients","production of IL","disease severity","disease progression","key inflammatory mediators","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","production of key inflammatory markers","therapeutic potential of \u03B17nAChR agonists","exacerbation phase","stable phase","chronic respiratory symptoms","novel therapeutic alternatives","impaired lung function","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","progressive airflow limitation","bronchodilators","major source","strong positive correlation","frequent exacerbations","immune-modulatory actions","alpha","nicotinic receptors","unmet need","evidence","SCOPD","ECOPD","FEV1","ability","Nitric Oxide","addition","study","GTS"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence in children is high, and it potentially contributes to significant morbidity. Iota-carragenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed, has reduced viral load in nasal secretions and alleviated symptoms in adults with common cold. METHODS: We have assessed the antiviral and therapeutic activity of a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in children with acute symptoms of common cold. A cohort of 153 children between 1\u201318 years (mean age 5 years), displaying acute symptoms of common cold were randomly assigned to treatment with a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan (0.12%) as verum or 0.9% sodium chloride solution as placebo for seven days. Symptoms of common cold were recorded and the viral load of respiratory viruses in nasal secretions was determined at two consecutive visits. RESULTS: The results of the present study showed no significant difference between the iota carrageenan and the placebo group on the mean of TSS between study days 2\u20137. Secondary endpoints, such as reduced time to clearance of disease (7.6 vs 9.4 days; p = 0.038), reduction of viral load (p = 0.026), and lower incidence of secondary infections with other respiratory viruses (p = 0.046) indicated beneficial effects of iota-carrageenan in this population. The treatment was safe and well tolerated, with less side effects observed in the verum group compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this study iota-carrageenan did not alleviate symptoms in children with acute symptoms of common cold, but significantly reduced viral load in nasal secretions that may have important implications for future studies.

In Switzerland, distemper in domestic dogs is rarely reported. In recent years, the import of dogs from Eastern Europe to Switzerland has steadily increased. In the present study, we describe a distemper outbreak in 15 rescue dogs that were imported from Hungary to Switzerland by an animal welfare organisation. The data on vaccination and medical history were recorded (14 dogs), and the samples were collected to investigate CDV and vector-borne infections (13 dogs) and canine parvovirus infection (12 dogs). The dogs were monitored for six months. RESULTS: One dog was euthanised directly after import. Thirteen dogs showed clinical signs after arrival, i.e., diarrhoea (57 %), coughing (43 %) and nasal and/or ocular discharge (21 %); radiographic findings that were compatible with bronchopneumonia were present in four dogs. CDV infection was diagnosed in 11 dogs (85 %); 10 dogs (91 %) tested PCR-positive in conjunctival swabs. Vector-borne infections (Babesia spp., Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis) were found in 4 dogs (31 %). Three dogs were hospitalized, and six dogs received ambulatory therapy for up to two months until recovery. None of the dogs developed neurological disease. CDV shedding was detected for a period of up to four months. Because dogs were put under strict quarantine until CDV shedding ceased, CDV did not spread to any other dogs. The CDV isolates showed 99 % sequence identity in the HA gene among each other and belonged to the Arctic-like lineage of CDV. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the imminent risks of spreading contagious viral and vector-borne infections through the non-selective import of sick dogs and dogs with incomplete vaccination from Eastern Europe. CDV shedding was detected for several months after the cessation of clinical signs, which emphasised the roles of asymptomatic carriers in CDV epidemiology. A long-term follow-up using sensitive PCR and strict quarantine measures is of upmost importance in preventing the spread of infection. Dog owners and animal welfare organisations should be educated regarding the importance of complete vaccinations and the impact of dog imports on the spread of viral and vector-borne pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willi, Barbara; Spiri, Andrea M.; Meli, Marina L.; Grimm, Felix; Beatrice, Laura; Riond, Barbara; Bley, Tim; Jordi, Rolf; Dennler, Matthias; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/333a04fb2ab37297b4591e7d6179fd731f5c1bf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4504088.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26179635/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0471-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":["Switzerland","Hungary","Eastern Europe"],"keyphrases":["import of dogs","rescue dogs","domestic dogs","major pathogen of dogs","CDV shedding","CDV infection","CDV epidemiology","CDV isolates","lineage of CDV","non-selective import of sick dogs","vector","months","infections","Switzerland","spread of infection","spread of viral","present study","Canine distemper virus","Dog owners","distemper outbreak","Eastern Europe","canine parvovirus infection","strict quarantine measures","impact of dog imports","animal welfare organisations","cessation of clinical signs","sensitive PCR","upmost importance","incomplete vaccination","PCR-positive","importance of complete vaccinations","imminent risks","Leishmania infantum","sequence identity","Babesia","bronchopneumonia","Hungary","roles of asymptomatic carriers","long-term follow-up","Dirofilaria immitis","wild carnivores","medical history","arrival","BACKGROUND","radiographic findings","HA gene","conjunctival swabs","data","recent years","ambulatory therapy","period","ocular discharge","diarrhoea","CONCLUSIONS","Arctic","pathogens","neurological disease","samples","RESULTS","recovery"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we will discuss the current state-of-the-art of activity-based probes, reporter substrates, and other relevant tools based on Ub as recognition element, to study the enzymes involved in the complex system of ubiquitination.","publish_time":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Ovaa, Huib","journal":"Activity-Based Protein Profiling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3238b05f23a9fa199b2d44dbad0900849c834599.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178261/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2018_134","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific enzymes","Ub modifications","posttranslational modification influences","diverse posttranslational modification","polymeric chains","mixed chains","based probes","distinct signals","complex system of ubiquitination","wide scope of cellular processes","large variety of cellular functions","cell cycle regulation","proteasome-mediated protein degradation","instance","reporter substrates","different lysine","relevant tools","current state-of-the-art of activity","DNA damage responses","crucial role","unique ability","recognition element","controle","Ubl","molecules","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a critical role in lung innate immunity, but contradictory results have been reported regarding their functionality following HIV infection. Here, using the SIV rhesus macaque model, we document the effect of SIV infection on the phenotypic and functional properties of AMs. Following infection with SIV(mac251), AMs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampled over 2- to 20-weeks post-infection (wpi) were compared to those in BAL samples from na\u00EFve macaques. AM expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-1\u03B2, and chemokine RANTES drastically increased 2-wpi compared to AMs of na\u00EFve macaques (p \u003C 0.0001 for all), but dropped significantly with progression to chronic infection. Phagocytic activity of AMs 2-and 4-wpi was elevated compared to AMs of naive animals (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0004, respectively) but significantly decreased by 12-wpi (p = 0.0022, p = 0.0019, respectively). By 20-wpi the ability of AMs from chronically infected animals to perform SIV-specific antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) was also diminished (p = 0.028). Acute SIV infection was associated with increased Fc\u03B3RIII expression which subsequently declined with disease progression. Frequency of Fc\u03B3RIII(\u002B) AMs showed a strong trend toward correlation with SIV-specific ADP, and at 2-wpi Fc\u03B3RIII expression negatively correlated with viral load (r = \u22120.6819; p = 0.0013), suggesting a contribution to viremia control. Importantly, PD-1 was found to be expressed on AMs and showed a strong trend toward correlation with plasma viral load (r = 0.8266; p = 0.058), indicating that similar to over-expression on T-cells, PD-1 expression on AMs may also be associated with disease progression. Further, AMs predominantly expressed PD-L2, which remained consistent over the course of infection. PD-1 blockade enhanced SIV-specific ADP by AMs from chronic infection indicating that the PD-1/PD-L2 pathway may modulate functional activity of AMs at that stage. These findings provide new insight into the dynamics of SIV infection leading to AM dysfunction and alteration of pulmonary innate immunity. Our results suggest new pathways to exploit in developing therapies targeting pulmonary disease susceptibility in HIV-infected individuals.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunegnaw, Ruth; Mushtaq, Zuena; Enyindah-Asonye, Gospel; Hoang, Tanya; Robert-Guroff, Marjorie","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa8c9ce5d6162a02fc51e0d95b27e63a709ca140.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6618664.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of AMs","effect of SIV infection","dynamics of SIV infection","Acute SIV infection","HIV infection","functional activity of AMs","AMs of na\u00EFve macaques","chronic infection","functional properties of AMs","AMs of naive animals","Phagocytic activity of AMs","course of infection","wpi Fc\u03B3RIII expression","weeks post-infection","increased Fc\u03B3RIII expression","blockade enhanced SIV-specific ADP","over-expression","PD-L2 pathway","disease progression","SIV-specific antibody-dependent phagocytosis","SIV rhesus macaque model","HIV infected individuals","HIV-infected individuals","infected animals","pulmonary disease susceptibility","correlation","pulmonary infections","alteration of pulmonary innate immunity","strong trend","Frequency of Fc\u03B3RIII","expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1","plasma viral load","lung innate immunity","new insight","new pathways","contradictory results","BAL samples","developing therapies","dysfunction","critical role","T-cells","mac251","chemokine RANTES","bronchoalveolar lavage","anti-retroviral therapy","findings","stage","functionality","Alveolar macrophages","contribution","viremia control"],"language":"en"},

Three DLA-identical trichimeric recipients were established by simultaneously infusing marrow from two DLA-identical donor dogs into a DLA-identical recipient conditioned with 2 Gy total body irradiation and given a short course of postgrafting immunosuppression. After confirming stable hematopoietic engraftment, a kidney was transplanted from one of the two marrow donors into each respective trichimeric recipient. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from each kidney donor were then used to sensitize the alternate marrow donor. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) from the sensitized dogs were given to the trichimeric recipients, whereupon chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and kidney rejection were monitored. After DLI, we observed both prompt rejection of the transplanted marrow-donor kidney and disappearance of corresponding hematopoietic chimerism. Presumably, owing to shared minor histocompatibility antigens, host chimerism also disappeared and GvHD in skin, gut, and liver developed. The native kidneys, while showing lymphocytic infiltration, remained functionally normal.

The pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host remain largely unknown. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PEDV replication in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells was investigated. The effects of the structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the autophagy process and the autophagy-related signaling pathways were also examined. The results shown that PEDV replication increased the autophagy flux in IPEC-J2 cells, and that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the enhanced virulence of PEDV in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs. When autophagy was pharmacologically induced by rapamycin, PEDV replication increased from 8.5 \u00D7 10(5) TCID(50)/mL to 8.8 \u00D7 10(6) TCID(50)/mL in IPEC-J2 cells. When autophagy was pharmacologically suppressed by hydroxychloroquine, PEDV replication decreased from 8.5 \u00D7 10(5) TCID(50)/mL to 7.9 \u00D7 10(4) TCID(50)/mL. To identify which PEDV proteins were the key inducers of autophagy, all 4 structural proteins and 17 nonstructural proteins of PEDV were eukaryotic expressed. It was found that the nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) and ORF3 of PEDV were able to induce significant autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells, but the other proteins were unable to induce autophagy.

A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) to localize and organize cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling during diverse physiological processes. Among more than 43 AKAP isoforms, AKAP7 appears to be unique in its homology to viral 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs. Here we show that mouse AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to that of murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3 proteins. To determine whether AKAP7 could substitute for a viral 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE, we inserted AKAP7 cDNA into an MHV genome with an inactivated ns2 gene. The AKAP7 PDE domain or N-terminally truncated AKAP7 (both lacking a nuclear localization motif), but not full-length AKAP7 or a mutant, AKAP7(H185R), PDE domain restored the infectivity of ns2 mutant MHV in bone marrow macrophages and in livers of infected mice. Interestingly, the AKAP7 PDE domain and N-terminally deleted AKAP7 were present in the cytoplasm (the site of MHV replication), whereas full-length AKAP7 was observed only in nuclei. We suggest the possibility that viral acquisition of the host AKAP7 PDE domain might have occurred during evolution, allowing diverse RNA viruses to antagonize the RNase L pathway.","publish_time":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gusho, Elona; Zhang, Rong; Jha, Babal K.; Thornbrough, Joshua M.; Dong, Beihua; Gaughan, Christina; Elliott, Ruth; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f4261729c0f4fadccac90a0da2c995f13b65802.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a83f14464310d40fdac66e2b2a00355dcf0b4737.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4161237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987090/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01312-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length AKAP7","mouse AKAP7","deleted AKAP7","truncated AKAP7","AKAP7 cDNA","host AKAP7 PDE domain","infectivity of ns2 mutant MHV","MHV genome","viral acquisition","strain A59 ns2","site of MHV replication","diverse RNA viruses","PDEs","inactivated ns2 gene","disparate RNA viruses","kinase anchoring proteins","activators of RNase","human rotavirus strain WA VP3 proteins","mouse hepatitis virus","diverse physiological processes","regulatory subunits of protein kinase","bone marrow macrophages","murine coronavirus","cytoplasm","antiviral activity of interferon","cAMP","AKAPs","evolution","livers of infected mice","PKA","nuclear localization motif","H185R","kinetics similar","IFN","cyclic AMP","possibility","AKAP isoforms","homology","pathway","nuclei","phosphodiesterases","oligoadenylate"],"language":"en"},

The manuscript focuses specifically on the case study of using multiplexed assays for surveillance of respiratory pathogens.

Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are comprehensive and specific with respect to the pathogen but are rapid in reporting the data. It has proven difficult to implement these requirements on a large scale while maintaining patient privacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the automated export, aggregation, and analysis of infectious disease diagnostic test results from clinical laboratories across the United States in a manner that protects patient confidentiality. We hypothesized that such a system could aid in monitoring the seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens and may have advantages with regard to scope and ease of reporting compared with existing surveillance systems. METHODS: We describe a system, BioFire Syndromic Trends, for rapid disease reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Deidentified patient test results from the BioFire FilmArray multiplex molecular diagnostic system are sent directly to a cloud database. Summaries of these data are displayed in near real time on the Syndromic Trends public website. We studied this dataset for the prevalence, seasonality, and coinfections of the 20 respiratory pathogens detected in over 362,000 patient samples acquired as a standard-of-care testing over the last 4 years from 20 clinical laboratories in the United States. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks, and adenovirus and the bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. The dataset can also be considered in an ecological framework; the viruses and bacteria detected by this test are parasites of a host (the human patient). Interestingly, the rate of pathogen codetections, on average 7.94% (28,741/362,101), matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic Trends preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers while still collecting much useful information about the bacterial and viral pathogens that they harbor. Test results are uploaded to the database within a few hours of completion compared with delays of up to 10 days for other diagnostic-based reporting systems. This work shows that the barriers to establishing epidemiology systems are no longer scientific and technical but rather administrative, involving questions of patient privacy and data ownership. We have demonstrated here that these barriers can be overcome. This first look at the resulting data stream suggests that Syndromic Trends will be able to provide high-resolution analysis of circulating respiratory pathogens and may aid in the detection of new outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyers, Lindsay; Ginocchio, Christine C; Faucett, Aimie N; Nolte, Frederick S; Gesteland, Per H; Leber, Amy; Janowiak, Diane; Donovan, Virginia; Dien Bard, Jennifer; Spitzer, Silvia; Stellrecht, Kathleen A; Salimnia, Hossein; Selvarangan, Rangaraj; Juretschko, Stefan; Daly, Judy A; Wallentine, Jeremy C; Lindsey, Kristy; Moore, Franklin; Reed, Sharon L; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria; Fey, Paul D; Storch, Gregory A; Melnick, Steve J; Robinson, Christine C; Meredith, Jennifer F; Cook, Camille V; Nelson, Robert K; Jones, Jay D; Scarpino, Samuel V; Althouse, Benjamin M; Ririe, Kirk M; Malin, Bradley A; Poritz, Mark A","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ca68ac4cbda643bc9b11a04d5fdb30cd57b3c4d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/08beca0f49f6c33cf0ea4544f6dfe34b5932214d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6054708.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980501/; https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.9876","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioFire Syndromic Trends","Syndromic Trends"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["human patient","patient samples","patient confidentiality","Deidentified patient test results","questions of patient privacy","bacterial pathogens","viral pathogens","majority of pathogens","diagnostic-based reporting systems","BioFire Syndromic Trends","obfuscating patient identifiers","analysis of infectious disease diagnostic test results","Syndromic Trends public website","seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens","rapid disease reporting","ease of reporting","epidemiology systems","data ownership","pathogen-specific","molecular diagnostic system","clinical laboratories","Health care","United States","constant detection","existing surveillance systems","seasonality","resulting data stream","detection of new outbreaks","Early detection of outbreaks","barriers","dataset","public health professionals","rate of pathogen codetections","BioFire FilmArray","real-time monitoring of infectious diseases","high-resolution analysis","care testing","cloud database","outbreak preparedness","real time","aggregation","adenovirus","useful information","advantages","regard","syndrome","study","rhinovirus","spring peaks","automated export","response","viruses","parasites","scope","years","influenza","respect","standard","BACKGROUND","large scale","host","manner","coinfections","days","CONCLUSIONS","relative abundance of organisms present","requirements","delays","ecological framework","hours of completion","average","prevalence","OBJECTIVE","aim","predictions","METHODS","Summaries"],"language":"en"},

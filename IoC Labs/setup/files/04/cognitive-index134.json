Exploration of natural inhibitors and synthesis of peptidomimetic molecules has provided many promising compounds performing successfully in animal studies. Several protease inhibitors are undergoing further evaluation in human clinical trials. New research strategies are now focusing on the need for improved comprehension of protease-regulated cascades, along with precise selection of targets and improved inhibitor specificity.

Dogs and coyotes are definitive hosts of N. caninum and several species of domestic and wild animals are intermediate hosts. Dogs can become infected by the ingestion of tissues containing cysts and then excrete oocysts. It is not yet known whether sporulated oocysts are able to induce a patent infection in dogs, i.e. a shedding of N. caninum oocysts in feces. The objective of this study was to experimentally examine the infection of dogs by sporulated oocysts. The oocysts used in the experiment were obtained by feeding dogs with brain of buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) positive for anti-N. caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT \u2265200). Oocysts shed by these dogs were confirmed to be N. caninum by molecular methods and by bioassay in gerbils, and sporulated N. caninum oocysts were used for the oral infection of four dogs. The dogs were 8 weeks old and negative for antibodies to N. caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. Dogs 1 and 4 received an inoculum of 10,000 sporulated oocysts each; dog 2 an inoculum of 5000 sporulated oocysts and dog 3 received 1000 sporulated oocysts of N. caninum. The total feces excreted by these dogs were collected and examined daily for a period of 30 days. No oocysts were found in their feces. The dogs were monitored monthly for a 6-month period to observe a possible seroconversion and when this occurred the animals were eliminated from the experiment. Dogs 1 and 4 seroconverted 1 month after the infection with titer, in the IFAT, of 1600 and 800, respectively; the other two dogs presented no seroconvertion during the 6-month period. Dogs 1 and 2 were euthanized 180 days after infection and were examined for the detection of N. caninum in tissues (brain, muscle, lymph node, liver, lung, heart and bone marrow) by immunohistochemistry and PCR with negative results in both techniques. Bioassay in gerbils with brain of these dogs was also performed and again the results were negative. In conclusion, dogs infected with sporulated oocysts of N. caninum were not able to shed oocysts in feces. However, a higher dose of infection stimulated the production of antibodies against N. caninum in the dogs.","publish_time":"2011-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandini, Luciana A.; Neto, Aldo F.A.; Pena, Hilda F.J.; Cavalcante, Guacyara T.; Schares, Gereon; Nishi, Sandra M.; Gennari, Solange M.","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdcb57ca4a03749e961145c638a2ba30aea8a1d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116961.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.10.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401710006126; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401710006126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neospora"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["caninum oocysts","infection of dogs","sporulated oocysts of","caninum antibodies","Abstract Neospora caninum","patent infection","oral infection","month period","higher dose of infection","negative results","total feces","production of antibodies","gerbils","brain of buffaloes","inoculum","bioassay","IFAT","experiment","days","intermediate hosts","ingestion of tissues","definitive hosts of","wild animals","indirect fluorescent antibody test","heart","lung","liver","lymph node","PCR","immunohistochemistry","positive","Bubalus bubalis","muscle","bone marrow","species of domestic","shedding of","molecular methods","weeks old","coyotes","major causes of abortion","possible seroconversion","parasite","cattle","techniques","Toxoplasma gondii","titer","seroconvertion","detection of","conclusion","study","world","objective"],"language":"en"},

Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5\u03BCg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5\u03BCg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and \u03B2-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0. We conclude that multiple injections of Catosal during the close-up period have a beneficial effect on the metabolism of periparturient dairy cows. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-producing dairy cows in early lactation may have a relative or actual deficiency of cyanocobalamin.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"F\u00FCrll, M.; Deniz, A.; Westphal, B.; Illing, C.; Constable, P.

At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3\u2032 UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic. Finally, we noted that four of the five N genes contain an internal open reading frame that potentially encodes a protein of 207 amino acids having a large proportion of basic and hydrophobic residues.","publish_time":"1990-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Monica M.; Masters, Paul S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d9708a84c8f53a508621c06001b9fb51a4bda3e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090316J; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090316J","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV N protein","N genes of MHV","MHV-S","MHV-JHM","N gene sequences","amino acid sequences","short segments of N","excess of basic amino acid residues","amino acid sequence divergences","amino acids","conserved domains","entire nucleotide sequences","higher nucleotide sequence identity","hydrophobic residues","basic proteins","nucleotide level","untranslated regions","conserved structural domains","large proportion of basic","putative spacer regions","viral strains","contrast","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","internal open reading frame","A59","carboxy-terminal domain","structure","negative-strand RNA synthesis","evolution","nucleocapsid","constraint","information","UTRs","data","role","cDNA clones","comparisons","molecule"],"language":"en"},

The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains internal domains called fusion peptides (FP) that play essential roles in virus entry. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied, there are still major gaps in the molecular details of lipid rearrangements in the bilayer during fusion peptide-membrane interactions. Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature. The significance of the ordering effect, membrane dehydration, changes in the curvature properties and the possible role of negatively charged phospholipids in helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier involved in the different stages of the SARS-CoV-mediated membrane fusion are discussed.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basso, Luis G.

The potential of intracellular antibodies for the systematic study of the proteome has been made possible by the development of new experimental strategies that allow the selection of antibodies under conditions of intracellular expression. The Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) is an in vivo two-hybrid-based method originally developed for the selection of antibodies readily folded for ectopic expression. IACT has been used for the rapid and effective identification of novel antigen\u2013antibody pairs in intracellular compartments and for the in vivo identification of epitopes recognized by selected intracellular antibodies. IACT opens the way to the use of intracellular antibody technology for large-scale applications in proteomics. In its present format, its use is however somewhat limited by the need of a preselection of the input phage antibody libraries on protein antigens or by the construction of an antibody library from mice immunized against the target protein(s), to provide an enriched input library to compensate for the suboptimal efficiency of transformation of the yeast cells. These enrichment steps require expressing the corresponding proteins, which represents a severe bottleneck for the scaling up of the technology. We describe here the construction of a single pot library of intracellular antibodies (SPLINT), a na\u0131\u0308ve library of scFv fragments expressed directly in the yeast cytoplasm in a format such that antigen-specific intrabodies can be isolated directly from gene sequences, with no manipulation whatsoever of the corresponding proteins. We describe also the isolation from SPLINT of a panel of intrabodies against a number of different proteins. The application of SPLINT on a genome-wide scale should help the systematic study of the functional organization of cell proteome.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Visintin, Michela; Meli, Giovanni Antonio; Cannistraci, Isabella; Cattaneo, Antonino","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30ce5879bb6c4dedab0cbe892d1960c9ba192a5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126613.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002217590400136X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002217590400136X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IACT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody library","use of intracellular antibody technology","Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology","potential of intracellular antibodies","intracellular compartments","single pot library of intracellular antibodies","conditions of intracellular expression","antibody pairs","selection of antibodies","IACT","input phage antibody libraries","corresponding proteins","enriched input library","systematic study","construction","application of SPLINT","na\u0131\u0308ve library of scFv fragments","antigen-specific intrabodies","number of different proteins","effective identification of novel antigen","large-scale applications","protein antigens","target protein","panel of intrabodies","identification of epitopes","yeast cytoplasm","yeast cells","proteomics studies","present format","ectopic expression","functional organization of cell proteome","preselection","mice","development of new experimental strategies","suboptimal efficiency of transformation","genome-wide scale","manipulation","way","severe bottleneck","scaling","enrichment steps","hybrid-based method","gene sequences","need","isolation"],"language":"en"},

This T cell/NK cell dysregulation causes an aberrant cytokine release, resulting in proliferation/activation of histiocytes with subsequent haemophagocytosis. Histiocytic infiltration of the reticuloendothelial system results in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia ultimately leading to multiple organ dysfunctions. Common clinical features include high fevers despite broad spectrum antimicrobials, maculopapular rash, neurological symptoms, coagulopathy and abnormal liver function tests. Haemophagocytic syndrome can be either primary, i.e. due to an underlying genetic defect or secondary, associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases (also called macrophage activation syndrome) or infections. Infectious triggers are most commonly due to viral infections mainly of the herpes group, with EBV being the most common cause. HPS can be fatal if untreated. Early recognition of the clinical presentation and laboratory abnormalities associated with HPS and prompt initiation of treatment can be life saving. HPS triggered by viral infections generally does not respond to specific antiviral therapy but may be treated with immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents and, in refractory cases, with bone marrow transplantation.

Since many virological and immunological data on FECV infections are lacking, the present study investigated these missing links during experimental infection of three SPF cats with FECV strain UCD. Two cats showed mild clinical signs, faecal shedding of infectious virus from 4 dpi, a cell-associated viraemia at inconsistent time points from 5 dpi, a highly neutralising antibody response from 9 dpi, and no major abnormalities in leukocyte numbers. Faecal shedding lasted for 28\u201356 days, but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations. Remarkably, in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen, but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi, and shedding of non-enterotropic, mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards. Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(\u002B) regulatory T cells. These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desmarets, Lowiese M.

PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. The CyP40 protein has been shown to possess PPIase activity and, similar to other family members, can bind to the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). In this study, we created keratinocyte cell lines with CyP40 being stably knocked down using viral particles containing shRNA for CyP40 which knocked down the expression level of CyP40 transcripts by 90 to 99%. The proliferation rates of the cell lines with silenced CyP40 were decreased compared to the control cells. After UVA irradiation, the rate of apoptosis was found to be significantly lower in CyP40 silenced cell lines than it was in control cells. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was found to be less dissipated and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) less active in cells with knocked down CyP40 than in control cells after UVA irradiation. Also, less mitochondrial superoxide was detected in the cells with silenced CyP40 compared to control cells after UVA exposure. Moreover, silencing of CyP40 partially modulates expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial pore formation including CyPD, ANTs and VDAC family members. The ability of CyP40 to regulate UV induced apoptosis implicates this protein as a potential target for therapy in cancer cells.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jandova, Jana; Janda, Jaroslav; Sligh, James E","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a4b84ba2448e718cc5282f20d32ded2421af7bb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/92524339f0636d0026eeadd6d4ae5e1dc111e743.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3577976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220213/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3577976?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014482712004739; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482712004739; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.11.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UVA","VDAC","UV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["silenced CyP40","CyP40 protein","ability of CyP40","silencing of CyP40","control cells","CyP40 silenced cell lines","cancer cells","expression level of CyP40 transcripts","mitochondrial superoxide","UVA irradiation","mitochondrial pore formation","keratinocyte cell lines","mitochondrial membrane potential","mitochondrial permeability transition pore","VDAC family members","UVA exposure","potential target","rate of apoptosis","PPIase activity","peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase","expression of key genes","UV induced apoptosis","cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds","CyPD","ANTs","oligopeptides","MPTP","therapy","PPID gene","immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin","proliferation rates","viral particles","CsA","PPIases","shRNA","MMP","study","folding of proteins"],"language":"en"},

In porcine bladder and kidney cell cultures inoculated with isolated PED virus, cytopathic effects (CPE) including cell fusion were detected. Specific brilliant fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of these cells. Two- and 7-day old, and 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-week old specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were orally inoculated with PED virus isolated from an outbreak. All 2- and 7-day old pigs inoculated developed severe watery diarrhea from post-inoculation day (PID) 1 and died between PID 3 and 4. Although three of five 2-week old pigs developed diarrhea on PID 1\u20134, they eventually recovered. In the 4-week old group, three of five pigs had mild diarrhea for 1\u20132 days. None of the 8- and 12-week old pigs showed any clinical signs. Antibodies against PED virus were detected in all surviving pigs by virus neutralization (VN) test and immunofluorescence assay (IFA).

This article provides a contemporary review of the literature associated with the measures available to the civil aviation industry for mitigating CO2 emissions from aircraft. The measures are addressed under two categories \u2013 policy and legal-related measures, and technological and operational measures. Results of the review are used to develop several insights into the challenges faced. The analysis shows that forecasts for strong growth in air-traffic will result in civil aviation becoming an increasingly significant contributor to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Some mitigation-measures can be left to market-forces as the key-driver for implementation because they directly reduce airlines\u0027 fuel consumption, and their impact on reducing fuel-costs will be welcomed by the industry. Other mitigation-measures cannot be left to market-forces. Speed of implementation and stringency of these measures will not be satisfactorily resolved unattended, and the current global regulatory-framework does not provide the necessary strength of stewardship. A global regulator with \u2018teeth\u2019 needs to be established, but investing such a body with the appropriate level of authority requires securing an international agreement which history would suggest is going to be very difficult. If all mitigation-measures are successfully implemented, it is still likely that traffic growth-rates will continue to out-pace emissions reduction-rates. Therefore, to achieve an overall reduction in CO2 emissions, behaviour change will be necessary to reduce demand for air-travel. However, reducing demand will be strongly resisted by all stakeholders in the industry; and the ticket price-increases necessary to induce the required reduction in traffic growth-rates place a monetary-value on CO2 emissions of approximately 7\u2013100 times greater than other common valuations. It is clear that, whilst aviation must remain one piece of the transport-jigsaw, environmentally a global regulator with \u2018teeth\u2019 is urgently required.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grote, Matt; Williams, Ian; Preston, John","journal":"Atmospheric Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0d5a12938df133bf9d3b0079d4811b7080f10d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108388.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.06.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288557/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231014004889; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231014004889","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitigation-measures","measures available","operational measures","mitigating CO2 emissions","anthropogenic CO2 emissions","legal-related measures","pace emissions reduction-rates","traffic growth-rates","civil aviation industry","air-traffic","required reduction","strong growth","overall reduction","Abstract Global airlines","market-forces","demand","teeth","current global regulatory-framework","necessary strength of stewardship","aircraft engines","air-travel","fuel-costs","Speed of implementation","contemporary review","airlines\u0027 fuel consumption","significant contributor","behaviour change","day","impact","monetary-value","resulting carbon dioxide","appropriate level of authority","forecasts","categories","policy","literature","international agreement","barrels of oil","times greater","transport-jigsaw","key-driver","common valuations","body","piece","analysis","ticket price","stringency","history","insights","article","concern","challenges","Results","stakeholders"],"language":"en"},

Despite their multifactorial etiology, the currently available diagnostic tests for bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and bovine enteric disease (BED) are single-pathogen-tests. DNA microarray when combined with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool in detection and differentiation of multiple pathogens in a single sample. This study reports development and initial validation of two independent highly sensitive and specific multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assays, one for the detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BRDC and the other for detection and differentiation of pathogens of the BED. The BRDC multiplex PCR-microarray assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma bovis) and five viruses [bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)] associated with BRDC. The BED multiplex PCR- microarray- assay was able to detect and differentiate four bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Dublin, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium), three protozoa (Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria bovis, and Cryptosporidium parvum), and four viruses (bovine torovirus, bovine rotavirus, BCoV, and BVDV) associated with the BED. Both assays detected their respective targets individually or in combination when present. The limit-of-detection of each assay at the PCR amplification and DNA microarray levels was determined using previously titrated laboratory amplified target pathogens or using quantified synthetic nucleotides. Both assays showed very high analytical sensitivity and specificity, and were validated using a limited number of clinical samples. The BRDC and BED multiplex PCR- microarray-assays developed in this study, with further clinical validation, could be used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories for the rapid and simultaneous identification of pathogens to facilitate quick and accurate decision making for the control and treatment of these two economically important disease complexes. Furthermore, these assays could be very effective tools in epidemiological studies as well as for screening of healthy animals to identify carriers that may potentially develop BRDC or BED.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thanthrige-Don, Niroshan; Lung, Oliver; Furukawa-Stoffer, Tara; Buchanan, Cody; Joseph, Tomy; Godson, Dale L.; Gilleard, John; Alexander, Trevor; Ambagala, Aruna","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdc208425eb355ce04e456a38a55b16f515cacff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113860.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418301083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102924/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.08.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418301083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","Salmonella"],"organizations":["BVDV","PCR","BRDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BED multiplex PCR- microarray","BRDC multiplex PCR-microarray assay","bovine herpesvirus","bovine rotavirus","bovine torovirus","bovine coronavirus","bovine enteric disease","bovine parainfluenza virus","bovine respiratory disease complex","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","specific multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assays","differentiation of pathogens","detection","bovine viral diarrhea virus","PCR amplification","DNA microarray levels","differentiation of multiple pathogens","simultaneous identification of pathogens","Eimeria bovis","viruses","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","bacteria","BCoV","BVDV","clinical validation","titrated laboratory amplified target pathogens","Salmonella enterica Dublin","Salmonella enterica Typhimurium","available diagnostic tests","important disease complexes","Eimeria zuernii","Mycoplasma bovis","initial validation","enteric diseases","single sample","single-pathogen","veterinary diagnostic laboratories","study reports development","limited number of clinical samples","Escherichia coli","protozoa","Histophilus somni","Pasteurella multocida","Mannheimia haemolytica","Clostridium perfringens","major causes of economic losses","quantified synthetic nucleotides","powerful tool","accurate decision","Cryptosporidium parvum","epidemiological studies","treatment","high analytical sensitivity","effective tools","carriers","screening of healthy animals","cattle industry","multifactorial etiology","respective targets","combination","specificity","control","present"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has highlighted the risks. Other well-known communicable pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been described previously. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. The issues related to imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious diseases are reviewed here. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel, and time elapsed since return) and clinical syndromes, together with systematic search policies, are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak. Single-bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results. Because person-to-person contact is the main route of transmission, healthcare workers should implement specific prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leblebicioglu, Hakan; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Rossolini, Gian Maria; L\u00F3pez-V\u00E9lez, Rogelio; Zahar, Jean-Ralph; Rello, Jordi","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e60d298dcd915defe348f16660ed1cd16d865e12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27134158/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["non-communicable diseases","return","well-known communicable pathogens","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","MERS-CoV","international travellers","Surveillance strategies","person contact","significant risk","contagious diseases","specific prevention strategies","healthcare workers","main route of transmission","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","isolation","carbapenemase","clinical syndromes","epidemiological data","country","systematic search policies","Single-bed hospital rooms","antibiotic resistance","duration of travel","rule","symptoms","destinations","activities","protection","time","home countries","laboratory test results","Enterobacteriaceae","Ebola haemorrhagic fever","intensive care","important cause of death","risks","Summary","issues","malaria","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory viruses and specifically the presence of co-infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) in hospitalized children during the H1N1 pandemic. A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 502 children with influenza-like illness admitted to inpatient care at a pediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during the 6 months spanning the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: One or more viruses were detected in 61.6% of the samples. Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% co-infections (2\u20134 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Viral co-infections were relatively common in H1N1 infected hospitalized children and need to be considered when estimating morbidity attributed to H1N1. Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference.","publish_time":"2012-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rhedin, Samuel; Hamrin, Johan; Naucler, Pontus; Bennet, Rutger; Rotz\u00E9n-\u00D6stlund, Maria; F\u00E4rnert, Anna; Eriksson, Margareta","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c47b1bf314263894ae9a5589303b7af810741267.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3522717.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23272110/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051491","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["Europe","Stockholm","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","Viral co-infections","importance of co-infections","presence of co-infections","number of co-infections","H1N1-positive children","single infections","H1N1 infected hospitalized children","pdm09 pandemic","severity of disease","respiratory viruses","HRV","viral interference","terms of severity","retrospective study","study period","Respiratory samples","swine-origin influenza","secondary aim","Stockholm","pediatric hospital","inpatient care","panel","real-time polymerase chain reaction","longitudinal studies","repeated sampling","Sweden","illness","months","understanding","slower spread","large extent","Population","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","correlation","Europe","human rhinovirus","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","morbidity"],"language":"en"},

However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.","publish_time":"2011-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wertheim, Joel O.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6929c0cdf46c3ce1e9c963487cc83c986a2870ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3247791.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705379/; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/28/12/3355/13644771/msr170.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr170","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular dating of viral origins","older viral origins","older origins","codon-based substitution models","traditional nucleotide-based substitution models","ancient origins","viral phylogenies","age of viral lineages","genomic evidence","types of evidence","inability of nucleotide","evolving pathogens","sampled pathogens","temporal variability","Ebola","measles","complex patterns of spatial","length of branches","common recent ancestor","apparent underestimation of branch lengths","Statistical methods","selective pressures","avian influenza viruses","pervasive purifying selection","time","inconsistencies","estimates","number of cases","work"],"language":"en"},

It represents an important tool in the study of autoimmunity, complementing classical immunological research tools and cutting-edge genome wide association studies (GWAS). Recently, environmental wide association studies (EWAS) investigated the effect of environment in the development of diseases. Environmental triggers are largely subdivided into infectious and non-infectious agents. In this review, we introduce the concept of the \u201Cinfectome\u201D, which is the part of the exposome referring to the collection of an individual\u0027s exposures to infectious agents. The infectome directly relates to geoepidemiological, serological and molecular evidence of the co-occurrence of several infectious agents associated with autoimmune diseases that may provide hints for the triggering factors responsible for the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. We discuss the implications that the investigation of the infectome may have for the understanding of microbial/host interactions in autoimmune diseases with long, pre-clinical phases. It may also contribute to the concept of the human body as a superorganism where the microbiome is part of the whole organism, as can be seen with mitochondria which existed as microbes prior to becoming organelles in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms over time. A similar argument can now be made in regard to normal intestinal flora, living in symbiosis within the host. We also provide practical examples as to how we can characterise and measure the totality of a disease-specific infectome, based on the experimental approaches employed from the \u201Cimmunome\u201D and \u201Cmicrobiome\u201D projects.","publish_time":"2012-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogdanos, Dimitrios P.; Smyk, Daniel S.; Invernizzi, Pietro; Rigopoulou, Eirini I.; Blank, Miri; Pouria, Shideh; Shoenfeld, Yehuda","journal":"Autoimmun Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f0ab2bee5fde00f2e1a9a2abd5bc05267d23f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105216.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997212002960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266520/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568997212002960; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2012.12.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoimmune diseases","environmental factors","environmental wide association studies","development of diseases","disease-specific infectome","Environmental triggers","non-infectious agents","microbiome","concept","exposome","cutting-edge genome wide association studies","study of autoimmunity","pathogenesis of autoimmunity","host interactions","triggering factors responsible","classical immunological research tools","EWAS","eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms","organelles","co-occurrence","GWAS","hints","molecular evidence","understanding of microbial","regard","normal intestinal flora","microbes","immunome","symbiosis","effect of environment","geoepidemiological","collection","individual\u0027s exposures","pre-clinical phases","human body","experimental approaches","superorganism","important tool","totality","projects","implications","investigation","term","similar argument","practical examples","mitochondria","review","lifetime"],"language":"en"},

It is also reported that endophytes play a vital role in the biosynthesis of various metabolites; therefore we believe that endophytes associated with F. indica are of crucial importance in this regard. The present study aims successful isolation, molecular identification of endophytic bacteria and their screening for bioactive metabolites quantification and in vitro pharmacological activities. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for the identification of isolated endophytic bacteria. Methanolic extracts were evaluated for total phenolic contents (TPC), total flavonoids contents (TFC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity, reducing power and total anti-oxidant assays were performed. And also screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities by disc diffusion method and their MIC were calculated by broth dilution method using microplate reader. Further, standard protocols were followed for antileishmanial activity and protein kinase inhibition. Analysis and statistics were performed using SPSS, Table curve and Origin 8.5 for graphs. RESULTS: Bacterial strains belonging to various genera (Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Erwinia and Stenotrophomonas) were isolated and identified. Total phenolic contents and total flavonoids contents varies among all the bacterial extracts respectively in which Bacillus subtilis showed high phenolic contents 243 \u00B5g/mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed high flavonoids contents 15.9 \u00B5g/mg quercitin equivalents (QA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) 37.6 \u00B5g/mg of extract, reducing power (RP) 206 \u00B5g/mg of extract and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity with 98.7 \u03BCg/mL IC(50) value. Although all the extracts tested were active to inhibit growth of selected pathogenic microbes (bacteria and fungi), but significant antibacterial activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumonia and B. subtilis. An Enterobacter cloaca was active against Leishmania tropica with IC(50) value of 1.4 \u00B5g/mg extracts. B. subtilis and Bacillus tequilensis correspondingly exhibit significant protein kinase inhibition of 47 \u00B1 0.72 and 42 \u00B1 1.21 mm bald zones, indicating anti-infective and antitumor potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that crude extracts of selected endophytic bacteria from F. indica possess excellent biological activities indicating their potential as an important source of antibiotics (antifungal, antibacterial) compounds.","publish_time":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahman, Lubna; Shinwari, Zabta K.; Iqrar, Irum; Rahman, Lutfur; Tanveer, Faouzia","journal":"Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa89136217edb205585668227efb1b0a976be854.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5540543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28764775/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12941-017-0228-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","B. subtilis"],"organizations":["Methanolic","MIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total flavonoids contents","total phenolic contents","\u00B5g","high flavonoids contents","high phenolic contents","bacterial extracts","crude extracts of selected endophytic bacteria","identification of isolated endophytic bacteria","significant antibacterial activity","molecular identification of endophytic bacteria","Bacillus subtilis","Methanolic extracts","total antioxidant capacity","antileishmanial activity","antifungal activities","antitumor potential","DPPH free radical scavenging activity","potential source of important chemical compounds","striking therapeutic potential","total anti-oxidant assays","Bacillus tequilensis","power","significant protein kinase inhibition","pharmacological activities","reservoir of therapeutic compounds","Fagonia indica","value","endophytes","important source of antibiotics","excellent biological activities","biosynthesis of various metabolites","growth of selected pathogenic microbes","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","quercitin equivalents","various genera","Enterobacter cloaca","medicinal plants","Bacterial strains","disc diffusion method","bioactive metabolites quantification","gallic acid equivalents","broth dilution method","fungi","TFC","successful isolation","GAE","QA","screening","TPC","Leishmania tropica","SPSS","Natural products of animals","diverse applications","Pantoea","picrylhydrazyl","Erwinia","\u03BCg","Table curve","S rRNA gene sequencing","present study","vital role","numerous researchers","Klebsiella pneumonia","Origin","METHODS","microplate reader","findings","TAC","statistics","graphs","BACKGROUND","crucial importance","therapeutics","standard protocols","RESULTS","diphenyl","cancer","RP","bald zones","regard","Analysis","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Among the existing aerosols in the indoor air, we can distinguish the bioaerosol with biological nature such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Respiratory viral infections are a major public health issue because they are usually highly infective. We spend about 90% of our time in closed environments such as homes, workplaces, or transport. Some studies have shown that AHU contribute to the spread and transport of viral particles within buildings. The aim of this work is to study the characterization of viral bioaerosols in indoor environments and to understand the fate of mengovirus eukaryote RNA virus on glass fiber filter F7 used in AHU. In this study, a set-up close to reality of AHU system was used. The mengovirus aerosolized was characterized and measured with the electrical low pressure impact and the scanner mobility particle size and detected with RT-qPCR. The results about quantification and the level of infectivity of mengovirus on the filter and in the biosampler showed that mengovirus can pass through the filter and remain infectious upstream and downstream the system. Regarding the virus infectivity on the filter under a constant air flow, mengovirus was remained infectious during 10 h after aerosolization.","publish_time":"2017-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandaly, Victor; Joubert, Aur\u00E9lie; Le Cann, Pierre; Andres, Yves","journal":"Food Environ Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df15df41a0487e6e1582283e1894adf497571246.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9310-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28660425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indoor air","air quality","reality of AHU system","air handling units","constant air flow","fate of mengovirus eukaryote RNA virus","indoor environments","virus infectivity","transport of viral particles","individual buildings","study","glass fiber filter F7","public health problems","Respiratory viral infections","characterization of viral bioaerosols","major public health issue","mechanical ventilation","closed environments","level of infectivity","scanner mobility particle size","heating","electrical low pressure impact","bacteria","homes","set-up close","viruses","biological nature","different governments","workplaces","important topics","artificial climate","reason","spread","RT-qPCR","quantification","time","air-conditioning systems","existing aerosols","results","fungi","aerosolization","biosampler","aim","studies"],"language":"en"},

We captured this bat species, which is widely distributed in Africa, in Zambia during 2008\u20132013. We detected the flagellin B gene (flaB) from pathogenic Leptospira spp. in kidney samples from 79 of 529 E. helvum (14.9%) bats. Phylogenetic analysis of 70 flaB fragments amplified from E. helvum samples and previously reported sequences, revealed that 12 of the fragments grouped with Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira kirschneri; however, the remaining 58 flaB fragments appeared not to be associated with any reported species. Additionally, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rrs) amplified from 27 randomly chosen flaB-positive samples was compared with previously reported sequences, including bat-derived Leptospira spp. All 27 rrs fragments clustered into a pathogenic group. Eight fragments were located in unique branches, the other 19 fragments were closely related to Leptospira spp. detected in bats. These results show that rrs sequences in bats are genetically related to each other without regional variation, suggesting that Leptospira are evolutionarily well-adapted to bats and have uniquely evolved in the bat population.

Strat\u00E9gie th\u00E9rapeutique Pour de nombreuses vascularites d\u2019origine virale, les traitements cortico\u00EFdes et immunosuppresseurs ne sont indiqu\u00E9s qu\u2019en seconde intention en cas d\u2019\u00E9chec des antiviraux et de l\u2019association d\u2019antiviraux et d\u2019\u00E9changes plasmatiques. Summary Viruses, the cause of vasculitis Although the majority of systemic vasculitis are of unknown causes, the responsibility of a viral infection has been formally demonstrated in some of them and specific treatment can permanently cure them. Each virus incriminated accounts for a particular type of vasculitis. Hepatitis B viral infection (HBV) is the cause of polyarteritis nodosa in 36 to 50% of cases. The onset of the symptomatology is acute, usually within a few months following the infection; it is comparable to that observed in the absence of HBV infection. Cryoglobulinemia related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) The clinical manifestations are those of systemic vasculitis with particular tropism for the skin (involvement generally inaugural and almost constant), peripheral nerves and the glomerula. They occur fairly late during the infection. Vasculitis associated with HIV infection There is strong tropism for the peripheral (multi-neuritis) and central nervous system. During acute parvovirus B19 infection Vasculitis lesions have occasionally been reported following the viremic phase, generally limited to one or several flares of vascular purpura predominating on the lower limbs. Following varicella-herpes zoster infection Vasculitis occasionally develops in the form of a central neurological deficiency (locomotor deficiency with or without aphasia around one month after an ophthalmologic herpes zoster) or involving the retina or, more rarely, the skin or the kidneys. Vasculitis associated with cytomegaloviral infection Predominantly observed in immunodepressed patients, vasculitis after CMV infection is diffuse and basically involving the digestive tube, notably the colon, the central nervous system and the skin. A rare complication of an HTLV1 infection Vasculitis of the retina often in the form of necrotic retinitis is often associated with spasmodic paraparessia. Therapeutic strategy For many vasculitis of viral origin, corticosteroid and immunosuppressive treatments are only indicated in second intention following failure with antiviral agents and the combination of antivirals and plasma exchanges.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Pascal; Guillevin, Lo\u00EFc","journal":"La Presse M\u00E9dicale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c05e5d8e613ea716d85bdc887af490d1806d3d12.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0755498204989361; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0755498204989361","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTLV1"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV infection","viral infection","infection virale","infection aigu\u00EB","months following the infection","the peripheral","the skin","the responsibility","The onset","the glomerula","is the cause","The clinical manifestations","vasculitis Although the majority","the lower limbs","the symptomatology is acute","They occur fairly late during the infection","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Des virus","Cryoglobulinemia related to the hepatitis","During acute parvovirus B19 infection Vasculitis lesions","reported following the viremic phase","Vasculitis associated with HIV infection There is strong tropism","virus varicelle-zona","causes de vascularites","Vascularites associ\u00E9es","it is comparable to that observed in the absence","cell Lymphoma Virus","Chaque virus incrimin\u00E9","nombreuses vascularites","type particulier de vascularite","Each virus incriminated accounts for","vascularite syst\u00E9mique","l\u00E9sions de vascularite","vascularite r\u00E9tinienne","peau","systemic vasculitis with particular tropism","syst\u00E8me nerveux central","plupart des vascularites syst\u00E9miques","cause inconnue","central nervous","generally limited to","d\u00E9ficit neurologique central","particular type","CMV","h\u00E9patite","fa\u00E7on aigu\u00EB","mois","VHB","polyarteritis nodosa in","syst\u00E8me nerveux p\u00E9riph\u00E9rique","formally demonstrated in some","manifestations cliniques","origine virale","unknown causes","fort tropisme","d\u00E9ficit moteur","\u00E9chec des antiviraux","phase vir\u00E9mique","zona ophtalmologique","fa\u00E7on formelle","atteinte de la r\u00E9tine","involvement generally inaugural","specific treatment can permanently cure them","occasionally","those","or several flares","vascular purpura predominating","usually within","HCV","HTLV1","almost constant","c\u00F4lon","compte","tube digestif","traitements cortico\u00EFdes","pupura vasculaire pr\u00E9dominant","association","celles","VHC","Human","neuritis","VIH","membres inf\u00E9rieurs","immunod\u00E9ficience humaine","celle observ\u00E9e","Summary Viruses","pouss\u00E9es","immunosuppresseurs","intention","aphasie","multin\u00E9vrites","responsabilit\u00E9","g\u00E9n\u00E9ral","r\u00E9tinite n\u00E9crosante","Strat\u00E9gie th\u00E9rapeutique","sujet immunod\u00E9prim\u00E9","nerfs p\u00E9riph\u00E9riques","constante","\u00E9changes plasmatiques","complication rare","Cryoglobulin\u00E9mies li\u00E9es","cytom\u00E9galovirus","parapar\u00E9sie spasmodique","glom\u00E9rules","p\u00E9riart\u00E9rite noueuse","symptomatologie","cases","traitement sp\u00E9cifique","reins","d\u00E9cours","the combination","the skin or the kidneys","the retina often in the form","the central nervous","or involving the retina or","notably the colon","herpes zoster infection Vasculitis occasionally develops in the form","basically involving the digestive tube","an HTLV1 infection Vasculitis","many vasculitis","vasculitis after CMV infection is diffuse","Vasculitis associated with cytomegaloviral infection Predominantly observed in immunodepressed patients","locomotor deficiency with","necrotic retinitis is often associated with spasmodic paraparessia","only indicated in second intention following failure with antiviral agents","month after an ophthalmologic herpes zoster","central neurological deficiency","Following varicella","more rarely","without aphasia around","immunosuppressive treatments","corticosteroid","viral origin","antivirals","rare complication","Therapeutic strategy","plasma exchanges"],"language":"fr"},

The disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. These diagnostic methods are laborious and time-consuming. The present study was aimed to evaluate the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid, early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. METHODS: A one-step single tube accelerated quantitative RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by targeting the Env gene of WNV. The gene amplification was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63\u00B0C for 60 min in both real time turbidimeter as well as routine laboratory water bath/dry heating bath. To rule out contamination issues, proper negative controls, including no template, no primer; and no enzyme, were always kept alongside each run. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated on 105 clinical samples from individuals having ocular infection. RESULTS: Of the 105 samples tested, 27 were positive for WNV by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative evaluation with conventional RT-PCR revealed 100 per cent accordance with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 per cent, respectively. The specificity of this assay was confirmed with serum samples obtained from patients with dengue and chikungunya. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP test seemed to be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of WNV infection and would be useful for rapid screening of a large number of clinical samples in endemic areas during outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Jyoti S.; Saxena, Divyasha; Parida, Manmohan; Rathinam, Sivakumar","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6022379.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0971-5916.234607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantitative RT-LAMP assay","RT-LAMP test","conventional RT-PCR","rapid detection of WNV infection","Env gene of WNV","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","serum samples","accurate diagnosis of WNV","large number of clinical samples","rapid screening","gene amplification","specificity","specific method","isothermal amplification","ocular infection","reaction mixture","cent accordance","diagnostic methods","polymerase chain reaction","dry heating bath","routine laboratory water bath","fluorescent antibody tests","one-step single tube","endemic areas","West Nile virus","proper negative controls","OBJECTIVES","real-time reverse-transcription loop","real time turbidimeter","template","contamination issues","isolation","BACKGROUND","patients","dengue","outbreaks","comparative evaluation","individuals","CONCLUSIONS","sensitivity","mosquito","chikungunya","primer","INTERPRETATION","present study","flavivirus","disease","RESULTS","run"],"language":"en"},

Aim To summarize antimicrobial resistance and assess the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China. Methods Seven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017, from which \u2018bug\u2013drug\u2019 combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HCAI, data from three tertiary care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. Findings A total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Non-susceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 29.5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were non-susceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HCAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GCs and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.07\u20130.11) per 1000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively). Conclusion The incidence of non-susceptible bug\u2013drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug\u2013drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HCAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in Dongguan City was higher compared with Europe.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Zhou, M.; Huang, G.; Guo, Z.; Sauser, J.; Metsini, A.; Pittet, D.; Zingg, W.","journal":"The Journal of hospital infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e8b59bec949d262c1212fb779206da1fd09d88f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243952/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120301286; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120301286?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","K. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["AMR","CAI","HCAI","European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network"],"locations":["China","Dongguan City","Dongguan","Europe"],"keyphrases":["incidence of non-susceptible bug","coli non-susceptible","Non-susceptibility","incidence proportion of bloodstream infections","Dongguan city","antimicrobial-resistant","AMR pathogens","incidence densities of HCAI","antimicrobial susceptibility data","multidrug-resistant pathogens","incidence density of HCAI","burden of infections","drug combinations","incidence proportions of CAI","predominant pathogens","China","healthcare-associated infections","patient data","Escherichia coli","GCs","European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report","Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System","acute care hospitals","tertiary care hospitals","Klebsiella pneumoniae","patient-days","carbapenems","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","frequency of community","HCAIs","generation cephalosporins","Acinetobacter baumannii","studies","Methods","Conclusion","fluoroquinolones","SUMMARY Background","quarter of Staphylococcus aureus","Findings","total","oxacillin","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

Cholesterol disruption of macrophage membranes using four pharmacological agents acting by different mechanisms: methyl-\u03B2 cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin complex and Lovastatin, all significantly inhibited productive HIV entry and reverse transcription. The inhibitory effects of these drugs resulted in decreased virus release from infected cells, and could be substantially reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol. The virus bound equally to cholesterol-disrupted cells even though HIV receptor expression levels were significantly reduced. Macrophage CD4 and CCR5 were found to partition with the detergent-resistant membranes with a typical raft-associating protein flotillin-1.

In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of its epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 assembled from 112 quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) showed a stable evolution and suggested two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaonan; Tan, Yun; Ling, Yun; Lu, Gang; Liu, Feng; Yi, Zhigang; Jia, Xiaofang; Wu, Min; Shi, Bisheng; Xu, Shuibao; Chen, Jun; Wang, Wei; Chen, Bing; Jiang, Lu; Yu, Shuting; Lu, Jing; Wang, Jinzeng; Xu, Mingzhu; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Qin; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhao, Guoping; Wang, Shengyue; Chen, Saijuan; Lu, Hongzhou","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434211/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2355-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Coronavirus disease","critical disease","Lymphocytopenia","Wuhan","predictive of disease progression","determinants of disease severity","clinical outcomes","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","Genomic sequences of SARS","immunological data","Influenza Data","confirmed cases of COVID","High levels of IL","urgent need","public health concerns","effective therapeutic measures","deep understanding","major lineages","differential exposure history","early phase","associated cytokine storm","admission","CD8","T cell","viral genetic variation","stable evolution","reduced CD4","Global Initiative","epidemiology","transmissibility","ongoing pandemic","China1","GISAID","patients","decreased lymphocyte count","host factors","Hubei province","treatment","outbreak","quality samples","similar virulence","pathogenesis","Shanghai","world"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-of-care testing (POCT). METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games, the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing. RESULTS: 20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team, most commonly within the same sport discipline. CONCLUSIONS: The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable, especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valtonen, Maarit; Waris, Matti; Vuorinen, Tytti; Eerola, Erkki; Hakanen, Antti J; Mjosund, Katja; Gr\u00F6nroos, Wilma; Heinonen, Olli J; Ruuskanen, Olli","journal":"Br J Sports Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dc1b1e197ec2bdd5ee03a588505a7a7c127c79d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6818521.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-100487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Team Finland","PCR","POCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common cold","influenza B virus","common illness","respiratory syncytial virus","virus-positive","virus infections","virus clusters","molecular POCT","Team Finland","staff members experienced symptoms","elite athletes","Winter Olympic Games","B viruses","onset of symptoms","elite sport","aetiology","possible causative respiratory viruses","molecular point","care testing","sport discipline","laboratory-based testing","PCR","OC43","main cause of medical time loss","NL63","rhinovirus","prospective observational study","challenge","median stay","standardised form","human metapneumovirus","coronaviruses","samples","close contacts","chief physician","oseltamivir","nasal swabs","Rapid diagnosis","days","METHODS","subjects","OBJECTIVES","cases","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa had global impact beyond the primarily affected countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Other countries, including the United States, encountered numerous patients who arrived from highly affected countries with fever or other signs or symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease (EVD). Methods. We describe our experience evaluating 25 travelers who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition for a person under investigation (PUI) for EVD from July 20, 2014 to January 28, 2015. All patients were triaged and evaluated under the guidance of institutional protocols to the emergency department, outpatient tropical medicine clinic, or Emory\u0027s Ebola treatment unit. Strict attention to infection control and early involvement of public health authorities guided the safe evaluation of these patients. Results. None were diagnosed with EVD. Respiratory illnesses were common, and 8 (32%) PUI were confirmed to have influenza. Four patients (16%) were diagnosed with potentially life-threatening infections or conditions, including 3 with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and 1 with diabetic ketoacidosis. Conclusions. In addition to preparing for potential patients with EVD, Ebola assessment centers should consider other life-threatening conditions requiring urgent treatment, and travelers to affected countries should be strongly advised to seek pretravel counseling. Furthermore, attention to infection control in all aspects of PUI evaluation is paramount and has presented unique challenges. Lessons learned from our evaluation of potential patients with EVD can help inform preparations for future outbreaks of highly pathogenic communicable diseases.","publish_time":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fairley, Jessica K.; Kozarsky, Phyllis E.; Kraft, Colleen S.; Guarner, Jeannette; Steinberg, James P.; Anderson, Evan; Jacob, Jesse T.; Meloy, Patrick; Gillespie, Darria; Espinoza, Tamara R.; Isakov, Alexander; Vanairsdale, Sharon; Baker, Esther; Wu, Henry M.","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/879df084e06fcce1980e3f73c36748068b39f049.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4766384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26925428/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofw005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Centers for Disease Control","EVD","PUI"],"locations":["West Africa","Guinea","Liberia","Sierra Leone","United States"],"keyphrases":["EVD","evaluation of potential patients","numerous patients","affected countries","Disease Control","infection control","Ebola epidemic","countries of Guinea","Ebola assessment centers","Ebola virus disease","aspects of PUI evaluation","Emory\u0027s Ebola treatment unit","safe evaluation","life-threatening conditions","travelers","US Centers","urgent treatment","Strict attention","life-threatening infections","outpatient tropical medicine clinic","emergency department","early involvement of public health authorities","signs","Prevention case definition","symptoms consistent","future outbreaks","global impact","person","West Africa","fever","investigation","preparations","pathogenic communicable diseases","Plasmodium falciparum malaria","guidance of institutional protocols","Liberia","United States","diabetic ketoacidosis","Sierra Leone","unique challenges","Respiratory illnesses","Lessons","addition","pretravel counseling","experience","influenza","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)). To calculate R(0) from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required. This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data. Here, we propose two new models that can reliably estimate the average life span of infected cells from acute-phase data, and apply both methods to experimental data from humanized mice infected with HIV-1. METHODS: Both new models, called as the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model, are derived by simplification of a standard model for the acute-phase dynamics of target cells, viruses and infected cells. By having only a limited number of parameters, both models allow us to reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells. Simulated datasets with plausible parameter values are generated with the standard model to compare the performance of the new models with that of the major previous model (i.e., the simple exponential model). Finally, we fit models to time course data from HIV-1 infected humanized mice to estimate the several important parameters characterizing their acute infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new models provided much better estimates than the previous model because they more precisely capture the de novo infection process. Both models describe the acute phase of HIV-1 infected humanized mice reasonably well, and we estimated an average death rate of infected cells of 0.61 and 0.61, an average exponential growth rate of 0.69 and 0.76, and an average basic reproduction number of 2.30 and 2.38 in the RQS model and the PWR model, respectively. These estimates are fairly close to those obtained in humans.","publish_time":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikeda, Hiroki; de Boer, Rob J; Sato, Kei; Morita, Satoru; Misawa, Naoko; Koyanagi, Yoshio; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Iwami, Shingo","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33222702ba2e2e7e5f526c667d64beb5bd2cda96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4035760.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-11-22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["half-life of infected cells","average death rate of infected cells","RQS model","standard model","PWR model","new models","acute-phase data","infected humanized mice","acute infection data","average life span of infected cells","simple exponential model","acute phase of HIV","major previous model","acute-phase dynamics of target cells","virus load data","experimental data","treatment data","average exponential growth rate","average basic reproduction number","time course data","chronic phase","simian immunodeficiency virus","human immunodeficiency virus","Mathematical modeling of virus dynamics","methods","limited number of parameters","novo infection process","hepatitis B","important parameters","better estimates","influenza","quantitative insights","viruses","reduced quasi-steady state","viral infections","plausible parameter values","piece-wise regression","Simulated datasets","BACKGROUND","performance","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","simplification","humans"],"language":"en"},

We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the \u201CX chromosome\u2013nucleolus nexus\u201D hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","publish_time":"2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brooks, Wesley H.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8495f7c65f4a6cbce0e0d53c0900f10f6740826e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5712313.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234321/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleolus nexus","RNA transcripts","inactive X chromosome","viral RNA","Polyamines","effects of viruses","disrupted inactive X","disruption of nucleolar activity","activity of nucleoli","sequestered Alu elements","major site of RNA processing","Sudden expression","Nucleolar expansion","sequestered DNA","proteins","subsequent disruption","increased demands","increased expression of cellular polyamine genes","large concentration of Alu elements","intronic Alu sequences","nucleolar structural integrity","ribonucleoprotein assembly","abnormal increases","production of additional cellular machinery","generation of autoantigens","misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes","misfolded RNAs","autoimmune diseases","ribosomes","nearby chromatin","hypothesis","significant roles","virus places","mechanisms","fragmentation","high levels","host cells","stress","insight","lupus","components","size"],"language":"en"},

No reports have described the detection of ERBV in fecal samples of horses and no complete genome sequences of ERBV3 are available. METHODS: We performed a molecular epidemiology study to detect ERBVs in horses from Dubai and Hong Kong. Complete genome sequencing of the ERBVs as well as viral loads and genome, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis were performed on the positive samples. RESULTS: ERBV was detected in four (13.8 %) of the 29 fecal samples in horses from Dubai, with viral loads 8.28 \u00D7 10(3) to 5.83 \u00D7 10(4) copies per ml, but none of the 47 fecal samples in horses from Hong Kong by RT-PCR. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the four strains were ERBV3 and one was ERBV2. The major difference between the genomes of ERBV3 and those of ERBV1 and ERBV2 lied in the amino acid sequences of their VP1 proteins. The Ka/Ks ratios of all the coding regions in the ERBV3 genomes were all \u003C0.1, suggesting that ERBV3 were stably evolving in horses. Using the uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock model on VP1 gene, the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of ERBV3 was estimated to be 1785 (HPDs, 1176 to 1937) and the MRCA dates of ERBV1 and ERBV2 were estimated to be 1848 (HPDs, 1466 to 1949) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both acid stable (ERBV3) and acid labile (ERBV2) ERBVs could be found in fecal samples of horses.

The reports of its person-to-person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pandemic potential. Here we characterize the six-helix bundle fusion core structure of MERS-CoV spike protein S2 subunit by X-ray crystallography and biophysical analysis. We find that two peptides, HR1P and HR2P, spanning residues 998\u20131039 in HR1 and 1251\u20131286 in HR2 domains, respectively, can form a stable six-helix bundle fusion core structure, suggesting that MERS-CoV enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism. HR2P can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. Introduction of hydrophilic residues into HR2P results in significant improvement of its stability, solubility and antiviral activity. Therefore, the HR2P analogues have good potential to be further developed into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating MERS-CoV infection.

The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4(\u002B) T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.","publish_time":"2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Daiting; He, Feilong; Bi, Shuilian; Guo, Huixia; Zhang, Baoshi; Wu, Fan; Liang, Jiaqi; Yang, Youtian; Tian, Qin; Ju, Chunmei; Fan, Huiying; Chen, Jinding; Guo, Xiaofeng; Luo, Yongwen","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4871871.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27242764/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00751","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RABV","Newcastle","CNS","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RABV infection","HEP-Flury infection","regulated genes","host genes","virulent RABV strain CVS","clearance of attenuated RABV","RABV strains","CNS","attenuated rabies virus","precise neuropathogenesis of rabies","innate immunity pre-activated","MHC class","adaptive immunity","cell death","mediated antigen presentation pathway","intranasally inoculated mice","cell adhesion","RNA-Seq","RNA sequencing","brain transcriptomes of normal mice","neuronal death","Newcastle disease virus","mechanisms of viral clearance","post-exposure treatment window","major public health concern","blood vessel morphogenesis","potential therapeutic targets","T cells","inflammation","intranasal inoculation","NDV","greater extent","developing countries","fatal encephalitis","coagulation","synaptic transmission","subtle clinical signs","central nervous system","ion transport","expression levels","collaboration of CD4","RIG","dysfunction","results","entry","addition","MDA","hand"],"language":"en"},

Pitfalls associated with this technique include limits to the number of targeted pathogens, the requirement for continuous monitoring to ensure sensitivity/specificity is maintained and the need to evolve to include emerging pathogens. Introducing target independent next generation sequencing (NGS) could resolve these issues and revolutionise respiratory viral diagnostics. Objectives To compare the sensitivity and specificity of target independent NGS against the current standard diagnostic test. Study design Diagnostic RT-PCR of clinical samples was carried out in parallel with target independent NGS. NGS sequences were analyzed to determine the proportion with viral origin and consensus sequences were used to establish viral genotypes and serotypes where applicable. Results 89 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. A viral pathogen was detected in 43% of samples by NGS and 54% by RT-PCR. All NGS viral detections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Conclusions Target independent NGS can detect viral pathogens in clinical samples. Where viruses were detected by RT-PCR alone the Ct value was higher than those detected by both assays, suggesting an NGS detection cut-off \u2013 Ct=32. The sensitivity and specificity of NGS compared with RT-PCR was 78% and 80% respectively. This is lower than current diagnostic assays but NGS provided full genome sequences in some cases, allowing determination of viral subtype and serotype.

The virus was also identified later in China. Prevalence of PCV3 in Zhejiang province in southeastern China is not clear though it has been reported in many parts of China. RESULTS: PCV3 infection and its co-infection with other swine viral pathogens in pig herds of Zhejiang province were retrospectively investigated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and its sero-prevalence by indirect ELISA. PCV3 was found positive in 67.1% of the 283 clinical samples taken from 2014 to 2017 as shown by qPCR. Single infection with PCV3 accounted for only one-third of the samples, and majority were of co-infections, predominantly with PEDV (41.6%) but generally low with other swine viruses. Indirect ELISA using the PCV3 capsid protein as the coating antigen revealed an average sero-positive rate of 52.6% (40.8 to 60.8%) in 2345 serum samples from 2011 to 2017, with earliest yet high positive findings in samples taken in 2012. Of 203 serum samples, the qPCR method showed more positive findings than ELISA (81.3% vs 56.2%). With 89 serum samples negative by ELISA, vast majority (n = 81) were found positive by qPCR. There was negative correlation in levels of PCV3 DNA and anti-capsid antibody response. ORF2-based phylogenetic analysis revealed three major groups (PCV3a, PCV3b and PCV3c) of the 200 strains, 38 from this study and 162 reference strains from GenBank. Most of the strains from this study were clustered into PCV3c. Of the putative signature residues of the capsid protein (aa 24, 27, 77 and 150) relative to the three groups, only the PCV3a group strains showed a distinct pattern of residues VKSI (95% of the strains), while the other two groups did not have such a \u2018signature\u2019 pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provided further evidence that the novel virus PCV3 was widely distributed in China and might have emerged in Zhejiang province before 2014, most probably back in 2012 when there was high PCV3 sero-prevalence. PCV3 might be viremic in pigs and could spread by fecal shedding.

Crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox, a quite devastating disease, and lucky because (even considering that he did not know this at that time) he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent. Not only was he able to protect the young man but he took the first step towards the development of a vast new field, vaccination. It is acceptable to say that Jenner was lucky because he succeeded in promoting protection against smallpox using a cowpox virus and this induction of protection in a cross-reactive way is believed to be quite rare. Nevertheless, more and more examples of cross-reactive immune responses are being described and we are beginning to admit that cross-reactivity is far more common and important than we used to think. Here we review cross-reactivity in the immune system and the plasticity of T cell recognition. Based on the existence of T cell receptor promiscuous recognition and cross-recognition of conserved viral immunodominant epitopes, we propose two approaches to develop wide spectrum viral vaccines. The first one is based on the identification, characterization, and cloning of immunodominant viral epitopes able to stimulate responses against different viruses. The produced peptides could then be purified and serve as a basis for vaccine therapies. A second strategy is based on the identification of conserved patterns in immunodominant viral peptides and the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for MHC anchoring and TCR contact. Although we are still far from a complete knowledge of the cross-reactivity phenomenon in the immune system, the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes and the identification of particular \u201Cviral patterns\u201D seems to be important steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vieira, G.

Studies and application of nanotechnology was explored very extensively in the human medical field and also studies undertaken in rodents extensively, still either studies or applications in veterinary medicine is not up to the level when compared to applications to human beings. The application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively innovative. Recently, in the era of health care technologies, Veterinary Medicine also entered into a new phase and incredible transformations. Nanotechnology has tremendous and potential influence not only the way we live, but also on the way that we practice veterinary medicine and increase the safety of domestic animals, production, and income to the farmers through use of nanomaterials. The current status and advancements of nanotechnology is being used to enhance the animal growth promotion, and production. To achieve these, nanoparticles are used as alternative antimicrobial agents to overcome the usage alarming rate of antibiotics, detection of pathogenic bacteria, and also nanoparticles being used as drug delivery agents as new drug and vaccine candidates with improved characteristics and performance, diagnostic, therapeutic, feed additive, nutrient delivery, biocidal agents, reproductive aids, and finally to increase the quality of food using various kinds of functionalized nanoparticles, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, micellar nanoparticles, and metal nanoparticles. It seems that nanotechnology is ideal for veterinary applications in terms of cost and the availability of resources. The main focus of this review is describes some of the important current and future principal aspects of involvement of nanotechnology in Veterinary Medicine. However, we are not intended to cover the entire scenario of Veterinary Medicine, despite this review is to provide a glimpse at potential important targets of nanotechnology in the field of Veterinary Medicine. Considering the strong potential of the interaction between the nanotechnology and Veterinary Medicine, the aim of this review is to provide a concise description of the advances of nanotechnology in Veterinary Medicine, in terms of their potential application of various kinds of nanoparticles, secondly we discussed role of nanomaterials in animal health and production, and finally we discussed conclusion and future perspectives of nanotechnology in veterinary medicine.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Ding-Ping; Lin, Xin-Yu; Huang, Yi-Fan; Zhang, Xi-Feng","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d73d189618e61f04c6dbabf3bbf8aa7adc65b156.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6274759.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19113299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Veterinary Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of Veterinary Medicine","veterinary applications","application of nanotechnology","entire scenario of Veterinary Medicine","advances of nanotechnology","advancements of nanotechnology","future perspectives of nanotechnology","potential important targets of nanotechnology","micellar nanoparticles","polymeric nanoparticles","metal nanoparticles","potential application of various kinds of nanoparticles","animal production","various kinds of functionalized nanoparticles","review","Studies","potential influence","animal health","strong potential","drug delivery agents","biocidal agents","new drug","way","alternative antimicrobial agents","various areas of research","human medical field","animal growth promotion","nutrient delivery","new phase","terms of cost","current status","role of nanomaterials","use of nanomaterials","human beings","future principal aspects of involvement","era of health care technologies","vaccine candidates","performance","improved characteristics","feed additive","usage alarming rate of antibiotics","diagnostic","dendrimers","biomedical sciences","detection of pathogenic bacteria","income","biotechnology","liposomes","nanomedicine","glimpse","interaction","safety of domestic animals","reproductive aids","farmers","quality of food","concise description","conclusion","aim","incredible transformations","rodents","level","availability of resources","main focus","Nanoscience"],"language":"en"},

Typically, all protein domains are optimized in that indispensable functions can be assigned to small conserved motifs or even individual amino acids. The cytoplasmic tail of many viral spike proteins, although of particular relevance for the virus biology, is often only insufficiently characterized. Hemagglutinin (HA), the receptor\u2010binding protein of the influenza virus comprises a short cytoplasmic tail of 13 amino acids that exhibits three highly conserved palmitoylation sites. However, the particular importance of these modifications and the tail in general for intracellular trafficking and lateral membrane organization remains elusive. In this study, we generated HA core proteins consisting of transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic tail and a minor part of the ectodomain, tagged with a yellow fluorescent protein. Different mutation and truncation variants of these chimeric proteins were investigated using confocal microscopy, to characterize the role of cytoplasmic tail and palmitoylation for the intracellular trafficking to plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus. In addition, we assessed raft partitioning of the variants by Foerster resonance energy transfer with an established raft marker. We revealed a substantial influence of the cytoplasmic tail length on the intracellular distribution and surface exposure of the proteins. A complete removal of the tail hampers a physiological trafficking of the protein, whereas a partial truncation can be compensated by cytoplasmic palmitoylations. Plasma membrane raft partitioning on the other hand was found to imperatively require palmitoylations, and the cysteine at position 551 turned out to be of most relevance. Our data shed further light on the tight interconnection between cytoplasmic elements and intracellular trafficking and suggest a function of HA palmitoylations in both lateral sorting and anterograde trafficking of the glycoprotein.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scolari, Silvia; Imkeller, Katharina; Jolmes, Fabian; Veit, Michael; Herrmann, Andreas; Schwarzer, Roland","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/754a8acf286106f010055702af99388afef5d8c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hemagglutinin"],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytoplasmic tail length","short cytoplasmic tail","role of cytoplasmic tail","cytoplasmic palmitoylations","intracellular trafficking","cytoplasmic elements","anterograde trafficking","physiological trafficking","HA core proteins","intracellular distribution","chimeric proteins","Plasma membrane raft partitioning","binding protein","protein domains","viral spike proteins","function of HA palmitoylations","lateral membrane organization","truncation variants","hand","particular relevance","yellow fluorescent protein","individual amino acids","established raft marker","conserved palmitoylation sites","lateral sorting","influenza virus","virus biology","partial truncation","particular importance","Viral glycoproteins","small conserved motifs","Foerster resonance energy transfer","versatile tasks","transmembrane domain","tight interconnection","receptor","high functional conservation","surface exposure","Golgi apparatus","pathogenic life cycle","indispensable functions","confocal microscopy","light","modifications","substantial influence","Different mutation","ectodomain","primary structure","study","complete removal","data","cysteine","position","Hemagglutinin","addition"],"language":"en"},

In the current study, tissues of eight dromedaries receiving inoculation of MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) after recombinant Modified-Vaccinia-Virus-Ankara (MVA-S)-vaccination (n = 4), MVA-vaccination (mock vaccination, n = 2) and PBS application (mock vaccination, n = 2), respectively, were investigated. Tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. MERS-CoV infection in mock-vaccinated dromedaries revealed high numbers of MERS-CoV-nucleocapsid positive cells, T cells, and macrophages within nasal turbinates and trachea at day four post infection. Double immunolabeling demonstrated cytokeratin (CK) 18 expressing epithelial cells to be the prevailing target cell of MERS-CoV, while CK5/6 and CK14 expressing cells did not co-localize with virus. In addition, virus was occasionally detected in macrophages. The acute disease was further accompanied by ciliary loss along with a lack of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), known to mediate virus entry. DPP4 was mainly expressed by human lymphocytes and dromedary monocytes, but overall the expression level was lower in dromedaries.

This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002\u20132013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong\u0027s three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murakami, Jin; He, Yiming","journal":"Journal of Transport Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126791.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.12.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692316306196; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692316306196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transportation"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Kowloon"],"keyphrases":["associations of highway proximity","influences of highway proximity","highway interchanges","accessibility benefits of highway proximity","changing value of highway investment","office values","office prices","transportation businesses","value of office properties","Hong Kong Island","Hong Kong\u0027s","built-up office districts","excess traffic","value-added services","Abstract Transportation investment","lower transportation costs","value-added throughput","hedonic regressions","territorial findings","territorial divisions","higher market accessibility","hedonic price analysis","mobility-driven trade","supportive public transit services","amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses","greenway creation","interchange improvement","environmental sustainability","congestion charges","strategic applications of underground bypasses","mixed results","hub-port","cross-border relations","adaptive land","logistics facilities","New Territories","Kowloon","unobservable district effects","progressive policymakers","spacious workplaces","instrumental variables","particular importance","rezoning","disamenity","smart technology","transactions","aid of economic competitiveness","deindustrializing economies","limited empirical research","mainland China","complex process of deindustrialization","negative externalities","face-to-face communications"],"language":"en"},

Although this approach is complete, it is costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: One\u2010hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR\u2010positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV\u2010like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus\u2010like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus\u2010like particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR\u2010positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanz, Macarena G.; Kwon, SoYoung; Pusterla, Nicola; Gold, Jenifer R.; Bain, Fairfield; Evermann, Jim","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7afb40ff1e8710f31b4805249e6e6fcce6467e96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6430884.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788861/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fecal samples","presence of ECoV","hospitalized horses","feces of hospitalized adult horses","overall fecal shedding of ECoV","molecular detection of ECoV","healthy horses","PCR","particles","clinical relevance","gastrointestinal disease","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","electron microscopy","EM","hours of stress","OBJECTIVE","clinical signs consistent","gastrointestinal disorders","referral hospital","time of admission","diagnostic relevance","infectious causes of enteric disease","Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital","viral infection","exclusion","diagnosis of equine coronavirus","Polymerase chain reaction","CONCLUSIONS","imaging","viruses","tissue","Owner consent","sampling","approach","BACKGROUND","anesthesia","hospitalization","parvovirus","rotavirus","METHODS","ANIMALS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

As a DNA vaccine in mice, it induces a TH1 immune response. We vaccinated mongrel dogs with the VR1012NH36 vaccine for prophylaxis and immunotherapy against a high dose Leishmania chagasi infection (7 x 108 infective amastigotes). The untreated controls developed more symptoms, higher parasite/lymphocyte ratio, smaller DTH reactions, lower proportions of NH36-specific CD4\u002B cells and sustained NH36-specific CD8\u002B cell counts than dogs of the prophylaxis group. In the immunotherapy treated group, enlarged DTH reactions, enhanced CD4\u002B and sustained CD8\u002B lymphocyte proportions were also detected, however, without reduction of symptoms or parasite/lymphocyte ratio, indicating that the vaccine was sufficiently potent to prevent but not to control the disease. Both treatments determined higher survival rates. Anti-FML antibodies increased in vaccinated and control dogs while anti-NH36 antibodies were only increased in vaccinees (p= 0.000). The parasite load of an untreated survivor control dog (638.05 parasites) felt outside the IC95% of that of vaccinated dogs (32.02, IC95% 9.45\u201364.59) suggesting that both vaccination treatments succeeded in reducing the Leishmania infective burden.

We performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays to evaluate the gene expression levels of sequalene synthase (SQS), \u03B2-amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS) during stress. Finally, the glycyrrhizin content of stolons was determined via HPLC. The results revealed that due to osmotic stress, the gene expression levels of SQS and bAS were increased, whereas those of CAS were relatively unchanged at the seedling stage. At the adult plant stage, the expression levels of SQS and bAS were increased under drought stress conditions, whereas the gene expression level of CAS remained relatively constant. The glycyrrhizin content in stolons was increased only under severe drought stress conditions (S28d). Our results indicate that application of controlled drought stress up-regulates the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins and directly enhances the production of secondary metabolites, including glycyrrhizin, in liquorice plants.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasrollahi, Vida; Mirzaie-asl, Asghar; Piri, Khosro; Nazeri, Sonbol; Mehrabi, Rahim","journal":"Phytochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1008493bc8f2024ea3dbc238e0fb3be0f6ef79c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111703.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768283/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942214001071; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031942214001071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycyrrhiza","Glycyrrhizin"],"organizations":["CAS","HPLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of drought stress","severe drought stress conditions","osmotic stress","application of controlled drought stress","drought imposition","gene expression levels of SQS","expression of important genes","gene expression levels of sequalene synthase","levels of secondary metabolites","gene expression level of CAS","bAS","expression of key genes","adult plant stage","important secondary metabolites","seedling stage","glycyrrhizin content of stolons","lupeol synthase","cycloartenol synthase","liquorice plants","important medicinal plant","production of secondary metabolites","glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway","\u03B2-amyrin synthase","month-old plants","S28d","day-old plants","results","samples","biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins","LUS","semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays","S2d","Abstract Glycyrrhiza glabra","S16d","polyethylene glycol","days","world","study","h post-treatment","HPLC","irrigation"],"language":"en"},

Nsp1 did not block phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 but inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. While IRF3 was stable, CBP was degraded, and CBP degradation was proteasome-dependent, suggesting that CBP degradation is not due to the protease activity of Nsp1 but an intermediary is involved. Our data suggest that the Nsp1-mediated CBP degradation inhibits the recruitment of CBP for enhanceosome assembly, leading to the block of IFN response.

Observation of BEV infected cells by electron microscopy revealed that by 24 hours postinfection some cells exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells. Based on this finding, we analyzed several apoptotic markers, and observed protein synthesis inhibition, rRNA and DNA degradation, nuclear fragmentation, caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP and eIF4GI, and PKR and eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation, all these processes taking place after peak virus production. We also determined that both cell death receptor and mitochondrial pathways are involved in the apoptosis process induced by BEV.

Several strategies have been suggested. This study evaluates the impact of academic detailing and a computerised decision support system (CDSS) on clinicians\u0027 prescribing behaviour for patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The management of all patients presenting to the emergency department over three successive time periods was evaluated; the baseline, academic detailing and CDSS periods. The rate of empiric antibiotic prescribing that was concordant with recommendations was studied over time comparing pre and post periods and using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for concordant therapy in the academic detailing period, after adjustment for age, illness severity and suspicion of aspiration, compared with the baseline period was OR = 2.79 [1.88, 4.14], p \u003C 0.01, and for the computerised decision support period compared to the academic detailing period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02. During the first months of the computerised decision support period an improvement in the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was demonstrated, which was greater than that expected to have occurred with time and academic detailing alone, based on predictions from a binary logistic model. CONCLUSION: Deployment of a computerised decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices which was greater than the changes seen with academic detailing. The sustainability of this intervention requires further evaluation.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buising, Kirsty L; Thursky, Karin A; Black, James F; MacGregor, Lachlan; Street, Alan C; Kennedy, Marcus P; Brown, Graham V","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2afcf2ab2330cb56ec493f82d87fa0c5b5f076e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2527556.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-8-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18667084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["academic detailing period","impact of academic detailing","computerised decision support period","computerised decision support system","baseline period","antibiotic prescribing practices","appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing","successive time periods","CDSS periods","rate of empiric antibiotic prescribing","clinicians\u0027 prescribing behaviour","patients","post periods","interrupted time series analysis","concordant therapy","early improvement","community","adjustment","illness severity","emergency department","predictions","recommendations","Deployment","uptake of clinical guidelines","ideal method","suspicion of aspiration","odds ratio","pneumonia","changes","months","binary logistic model","hospitals","CAP","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","study","sustainability","intervention","evaluation","BACKGROUND","METHODS","management","strategies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The evaluation covered the period of 2012\u20132015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility. RESULTS: During the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yazidi, Rihab; Aissi, Wafa; Bouguerra, Hind; Nouira, Mariem; Kharroubi, Ghassen; Maazaoui, Latifa; Zorraga, Mokhtar; Abdeddaiem, Naima; Chlif, Sadok; El Moussi, Awatef; Ben Hadj Kacem, Mohamed Ali; Snoussi, Mohamed Ali; Ghawar, Wissem; Koubaa, Makram; Polansky, Lauren; McCarron, Margaret; Boussarsar, Mohamed; Menif, Khaled; Amine, Slim; Ben Khelil, Jalila; Ben Jemaa, Mounir; Bettaieb, Jihene; Bouafif Ben Alaya, Nissaf; Ben Salah, Afif","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42b049c2b5b32c094dc8b10f967e43ac2169b890.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6555026.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7035-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Influenza Center"],"locations":["Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["ILI surveillance","Tunisian influenza surveillance system","influenza situational awareness","data quality","quality of data","National Influenza Center","better monitor influenza","ILI cases","representative influenza virologic samples","ILI sentinel sites","ILI case definition","different data sources","simplicity","acceptability","representativeness","stability","timeliness","number of patients","total number of outpatients","flexibility","performance","evaluation period","utility","following week","pertinent evidence","public health interventions","indicators","completeness","country","illness","nasopharyngeal swabs","NIC","times","improvement","CONCLUSIONS","greatest strength","RESULTS","METHODS","resources","BACKGROUND","study","benchmark"],"language":"en"},

Three major strategies can be distinguished; they involve (i) the incorporation of new targeting specificity into a viral surface protein, (ii) the incorporation of a scaffold into a viral surface protein to allow the attachment of targeting moieties, and (iii) the use of bispecific adapters to mediate targeting of a virus to a specified moiety on a tumor cell.

A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out with the aim of studying the prevalence of various serovars of Salmonella in calves and their relationship with diarrhea signs. The study was conducted in Mar and Sierras Dairy Basin located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Seven hundred and twenty six calves both with diarrhea signs or not were sampled by rectal mucosa swab in 50 dairy farms during the rearing period. Isolates identified as Salmonella spp. were classified using polyvalent and monovalent antisera against somatic, flagellar and capsule antigens (Vi). Salmonella spp. was found in 36% of the farms and serotypes were: S. Mbandaka, S. Anatum, S. Typhimurium, S. Dublin, S. Montevideo, S. Meleagridis, S. Newport, S. Seftemberg, S. subesp. 16,7:z1, S. Infantis, S. Give. A percentage of 5.5% calves was positive and calves showing diarrheal signs were 5.9 times more likely to be infected with Salmonella spp. than those having no signs. The age of positive calves ranged from the first day of life to 53; the second day being the most frequent time. In conclusion, 11 Salmonella serovars were detected in one out of 3dairy farms in Mar and Sierras Dairy Basin, and not only were these serovars associated with diarrhea signs including the presence of mucus in feces, but they were also more prevalent among calves aged up to 21 days.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bilbao, Gladys N.; Malena, Rosana; Passucci, Juan A.; Pinto de Almeida Castro, Aldana M.; Paolicchi, Fernando; Soto, Pedro; Cant\u00F3n, Juliana; Monteavaro, Cristina E.","journal":"Revista Argentina de Microbiolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebc4113e742c261e87e18e8b1a1b9d89019c8707.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115763.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754118301184; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754118301184","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mediante","Salmonella","S.

MDA5 is one such sensor of virus presence and is activated by RNA. MDA5 is required for immunity against several classes of viruses, including picornaviruses.

Together with observations made in cancer cells, this suggests that MDA5 detects cellular RNAs in addition to viral RNAs. It is therefore important to understand the properties of the RNAs which activate MDA5. New data indicate that RNA length and secondary structure are features sensed by MDA5.

Owing to the differences in its genotype, FCoV belongs to a separate clade along with other viruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), which can be isolated from cats. In this study, a PCR assay was developed to differentiate these coronaviruses concurrently. Multiplex differential RT-PCR was performed with primers based on the highly conserved coronavirus membrane protein. Three primer sets were designed: a primer pair (S1 and S2) that can bind to conserved sequences in all target coronaviruses, a CCoV-specific primer (S3), and a TGEV-specific primer (S4). Because of the high sequence homology among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, a nucleotide preceding the last pair of dissimilar nucleotides in S3 and S4 was substituted with an inosine to allow primer binding. This assay could detect and differentiate FCoV (n =7), CCoV (n =4), and TGEV (n =8) precisely and did not show any cross-reactivity with other pathogens. These results suggest that this molecular approach provides a rapid and reliable way to detect FCoV, especially in feline clinical specimens.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Jae-Ik; Kang, Shien-Young; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Na, Ki-Jeong","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a24978908794ebd03603cea9f06e1f914c4f176.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113662.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414002845; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414002845; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25088974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV","CCoV-specific primer","TGEV-specific primer","primer pair","primer sets","primer binding","canine coronavirus","S3","Abstract Feline coronavirus","S4","PCR assay","conserved coronavirus membrane protein","target coronaviruses","conserved sequences","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","pair of dissimilar nucleotides","feline clinical specimens","differential RT-PCR","positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus","molecular approach","reliable way","primers","high sequence homology","S2","separate clade","genotype","inosine","S1","cross-reactivity","pathogens","results","study","differences","cats"],"language":"en"},

A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. METHODS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and consistency rate. RESULTS: The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 4(th) day after symptom onset. In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 rely on great specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stage of the illness.

In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community\u2019s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority.

The role of the individual-based linkage between different spatial domains is investigated. As we adjust the timescale parameter \u03C4 from 0 to unity, which represents the degree of activation of the individual-based linkage, three regions are found. Within the region of 0 \u003C \u03C4 \u003C 0.02 , the epidemic is determined by local movement and is sensitive to the timescale \u03C4 . Within the region of 0.02 \u003C \u03C4 \u003C 0.5 , the epidemic is insensitive to the timescale \u03C4 . Within the region of 0.5 \u003C \u03C4 \u003C 1 , the outbreak of the epidemic is determined by the structure of the individual-based linkage. As we keep an eye on the first region, the role of activating the individual-based linkage in the present model is similar to the role of the shortcuts in the two-dimensional small world network. Only activating a small number of the individual-based linkage can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally. The role of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control is checked. These two measures are found to be conducive to curbing the spread of infectious disease only when the global interaction is suppressed. A log\u2013log relation between the change in the number of infected individuals and the timescale \u03C4 is found. By calculating the epidemic threshold and the mean first encounter time, we heuristically analyze the microscopic characteristics of the propagation of the epidemic in the present model.","publish_time":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Li-Xin; Xu, Wen-Juan; Chen, Rong-Da; Qiu, Tian; Shi, Yong-Dong; Zhong, Chen-Yang","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1ae7022ee3f07838e37a2d4fca07b07d22758d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125621.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437115004380; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115004380; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual-based linkage","territorial epidemic model","networked epidemic model","generalized epidemic model","epidemic threshold","epidemic control","timescale \u03C4","present model","role","timescale parameter \u03C4","segregated spatial domain","small number","change","outbreak","different spatial domains","number of infected individuals","log relation","two-dimensional small world network","shortcuts","SIS","mobility","spread of infectious disease","encounter time","mean","propagation","unity","structure","local movement","degree of activation","global interaction","microscopic characteristics","Abstract","regions","measures","eye"],"language":"en"},

The discovery of a novel anti-influenza therapeutic approach would increase the effectiveness of traditional virus-based strategies. This study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment on influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced pneumonia in mice. METHODS: Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with H1N1, then anti-HMGB1 mAb or control mAb were administered intravenously at 1, 24 and 48 hours after H1N1 inoculation and the survival rate was analyzed. Lung lavage and histopathological analysis were performed on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 after inoculation. RESULTS: Anti-HMGB1 mAb significantly improved the survival rate of H1N1-inoculated mice (1 out of 15 versus 8 out of 15 deaths in the anti-HMGB1 mAb-treated group versus the control mAb-treated group, p \u003C 0.01), although the treatment did not affect virus propagation in the lungs. The treatment also significantly attenuated histological changes and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of H1N1-inoculated mice. This was associated with inhibition of HMGB1 and suppression of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression and oxidative stress enhancement, which were observed in H1N1-inoculated mice. The expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products and nuclear factor \u03BAB was attenuated by the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HMGB1 mAb may provide a novel and effective pharmacological strategy for severe influenza virus infection in humans by reducing the inflammatory responses induced by HMGB1.

Its haemagglutinin showed epitope structures that were not recognized by the immune system of children and young adults as a memory response. The pandemic influenza virus consisted of quasispecies with a mixture of genome parts from human, avian, and American and Eurasian swine origin. This new virus caused all symptoms typically for influenza as abrupt onset, fever \u003E39\u00B0C, sore throat with all signs of inflammation, myalgia and arthralgia. In summer 2009 all infections in Europe were mild, while until winter there was a higher lethality in Brazil, Mexico and Argentine; but still in winter 2009 in Europe the pathogenic action of the circulating virus was mild. European isolates showed a neuraminidase inhibitor resistance of around 10%. Prevention of spread of the novel influenza virus H1N1 2009 is mainly by hygienic measurements as: avoid contact to infected, distance from infected, hand disinfection, protection of eye and nose mucous membranes, avoid aerosol formation during blowing the nose and sneezing. It is recommended to use single way tissue handkerchiefs and to depose them in a covered waste reservoir. For further prevention of influenza virus transmission three different vaccines are available in Europe since October 2009. This virus or at least some genomic parts will persist in the human population for the next 2 years.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guertler, Lutz G.","journal":"DoctorConsult - The Journal.

The guidelines of personal protective equipment for swab sampling, endoscopy and surgery were listed. Indications for tracheotomy during the pandemic should be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary airway opening and aerosol-generation; precautions during surgery to reduce the risk of exposure and infection were illustrated.

The suitability of infrared thermography (IRT) as a noninvasive, automated method for early disease detection was also assessed. Forty-three calves either (1) were experimentally infected with rotavirus (n = 20) or (2) acted as uninfected controls (n = 23). Health checks were conducted on a daily basis to identify when calves presented overt clinical signs of disease. In addition, fecal samples were collected to verify NCD as the cause of illness. Feeding behavior was recorded continuously as calves fed from an automated calf feeder, and IRT temperatures were recorded once per day across 5 anatomical locations using a hand-held IRT camera. Lying behavior was recorded continuously using accelerometers. Drinking behavior at the water trough was filmed continuously to determine the number and duration of visits. Respiration rate was recorded once per day by observing flank movements. The effectiveness of inoculating calves with rotavirus was limited because not all calves in the infected group contracted the virus; further, an unexpected outbreak of Salmonella during the trial led to all calves developing NCD, including those in the healthy control group. Therefore, treatment was ignored and instead each calf was analyzed as its own control, with data analyzed with respect to when each calf displayed clinical signs of disease regardless of the causative pathogen. Milk consumption decreased before clinical signs of disease appeared. The IRT temperatures were also found to change before clinical signs of disease appeared, with a decrease in shoulder temperature and an increase in side temperature. There were no changes in respiration rate or lying time before clinical signs of disease appeared. However, the number of lying bouts decreased and lying bout duration increased before and following clinical signs of disease. There was no change in the number of visits to the water trough, but visit duration increased before clinical signs of disease appeared. Results indicate that milk consumption, IRT temperatures of the side and shoulder, number and duration of lying bouts, and duration of time spent at the water trough show potential as suitable early indicators of disease.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lowe, G.

The porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of TGEV infection, but the mechanisms that TGEV disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and invades the host epithelium remain largely unknown. We not only found that TGEV infection stimulates F-actin to gather at the cell membrane but the disruption of F-actin inhibits TGEV entry as well. Cofilin is involved in F-actin reorganization and TGEV entry. The TGEV spike protein is capable of binding with EGFR, activating the downstream phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), then causing the phosphorylation of cofilin and F-actin polymerization via Rac1/Cdc42 GTPases. Inhibition of EGFR and PI3K decreases the entry of TGEV. EGFR is also the upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that is involved in F-actin reorganization. Additionally, lipid rafts act as signal platforms for the EGFR-associated signaling cascade and correlate with the adhesion of TGEV. In conlusion, these results provide valuable data of the mechanisms which are responsible for the TGEV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new methods about controlling TGEV.","publish_time":"2016-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Weiwei; Zhu, Liqi; Yang, Xing; Lin, Jian; Yang, Qian","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebbe2e390320b9cd9399ba2e7d011df6e953971e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4914279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26933809/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.7723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","EGFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV entry","entry of TGEV","TGEV pathogenesis","adhesion of TGEV","TGEV spike protein","target of TGEV infection","F-actin reorganization","F-actin polymerization","actin cytoskeleton","disruption of F","Inhibition of EGFR","mechanisms","PI3K","activated protein kinase","host epithelium","phosphorylation of cofilin","porcine intestinal epithelium","upstream activator of mitogen","high mortality","severe diarrhea","capable of binding","MAPK","coronavirus","Rac1","newborn piglets","valuable data","downstream phosphoinositide","results","signal platforms","Cdc42 GTPases","pathways","cell membrane","development of new methods","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","lipid rafts","conlusion","cascade"],"language":"en"},

There are hundreds of pathogens that may be present in fecal material, making it not feasible to analyze water for all of them. Thus, the microbiological quality of water is monitored using indicator organisms, such as coliform bacteria, enterococci, and/or bacteriophages, which are much simpler and less expensive to detect.

Sensitive diagnostics and efficacious vaccines are necessary to combat IBV infections in chickens. The aim of this study was to produce recombinant N protein of IBV in the baculovirus system to use in ELISA diagnostic tests in order to enable the assessment of the sero-prevalence and risk of IBV infections in chickens in Turkey. For this, the gene encoding the N protein of the Beaudette strain of IBV was expressed using a recombinant baculovirus expression system. The recombinant N protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. An estimated 50-kDa recombinant protein corresponding to the expected molecular weight of IBV N including the 6xHis tag was detected using an anti-His monoclonal antibody. Specific immunoreactivity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot using antiserum obtained from vaccinated and naturally infected chicken from Turkey as well as using a monoclonal antibody raised against the N protein of the IBV Massachusetts strain. The results obtained with the in-house ELISA had high agreement with a commercial ELISA. Immunoreactivity analysis using antisera in Western blotting and the in-house ELISA suggests that the recombinant IBV N protein could be broadly cross-reactive with antisera produced against different IBV strains. We conclude that the recombinant baculovirus expressed IBV N protein could serve as a useful diagnostic antigen for detection of IBV infections in chickens by ELISA.","publish_time":"2018-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yilmaz, Huseyin; Faburay, Bonto; Turan, Nuri; Cotton-Caballero, Maira; Cetinkaya, Burhan; Gurel, Aydin; Yilmaz, Aysun; Cizmecigil, Utku Y.; Aydin, Ozge; Tarakci, Eda Altan; Bayraktar, Erhan; Richt, Juergen A.","journal":"Appl Biochem Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e0fff0d12badd81afba0098f997f5143c0005f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29987628/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2815-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IBV Massachusetts","IBV N"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["recombinant N protein of IBV","recombinant IBV N protein","AvCoV-IBV","kDa recombinant protein","detection of IBV infections","risk of IBV infections","Beaudette strain of IBV","IBV Massachusetts strain","different IBV strains","expected molecular weight of IBV N","in-house ELISA","recombinant baculovirus expression system","commercial ELISA","chickens","ELISA diagnostic tests","baculovirus system","antisera","Turkey","monoclonal antibody","Western blotting","Immunoreactivity analysis","Specific immunoreactivity","useful diagnostic antigen","important avian pathogen","avian coronavirus-infectious bronchitis virus","new viral variants","continuous threat","efficacious vaccines","high agreement","sero-prevalence","assessment","Sensitive diagnostics","antiserum","Ni-NTA affinity chromatography","order","xHis tag","study","infected chicken","poultry industry","results","gene","aim"],"language":"en"},

The U.S. Healthy People 2010 initiative set a national goal of 60% coverage for HCW influenza vaccination by 2010. Yet vaccination rates remain low. In the 2008\u20132009 influenza season, Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC; New York) adopted a \u201Cpush/pull\u201D point-of-dispensing (POD) vaccination model that was derived from emergency preparedness planning for mass vaccination and/or prophylaxis to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, whether occurring naturally or due to bioterrorism. Launch of the HCW Vaccination Program In mid-September 2008, a two-week HCW vaccination program was launched using a sequential POD approach. In Push POD, teams assigned to specific patient units educated all HCWs about influenza vaccination and offered on-site vaccination; vaccinated HCWs received a 2009 identification (ID) validation sticker. In Pull POD, HCWs could enter the hospital only through one entrance; all other employee entrances were \u201Clocked down.\u201D A 2009 ID validation sticker was required for entry and to punch in for duty. Employees without the new validation sticker were directed to a nearby vaccination team. After the Push/Pull POD was completed, the employee vaccination drive at FHMC was continued for the remainder of the influenza season by the Employee Health Service. Results Using this model, in two days 72% of the employees were reached, with 54% of those reached accepting vaccination. Conclusions This model provides a novel approach for institutions to improve their HCW influenza vaccination rates within a limited period through exercising emergency preparedness plans for infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crupi, Robert S.; Di John, David; Mangubat, Peter Michael; Asnis, Deborah; Devera, Jaime; Maguire, Paul; Palevsky, Sheila L.","journal":"The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0fb60fe105ad301a94c213945c7034c783d5cd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106101.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553725010360739; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553725010360739","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Healthy People","HCW","Flushing Hospital Medical Center","HCW Vaccination Program","POD","Push/Pull POD","FHMC","Employee Health Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination model","on-site vaccination","mass vaccination","accepting vaccination","HCW influenza vaccination rates","employee vaccination drive","two-week HCW vaccination program","nearby vaccination team","influenza season","Push POD","Pull POD","new validation sticker","sequential POD approach","ID validation sticker","vaccinated HCWs","FHMC","Employee Health Service","employee entrances","Employees","emergency preparedness planning","infectious disease outbreaks","exercising emergency preparedness plans","New York","novel approach","Flushing Hospital Medical Center","Glance Background Health care workers","limited period","specific patient units","institutions","national goal","teams","identification","coverage","initiative","entry","prophylaxis","dispensing","Healthy People","patients","coworkers","Conclusions","point","remainder","Launch","days","duty","Article","Results","bioterrorism"],"language":"en"},

Detection rates ranged from 32% and 18% in duck and chicken swabs, respectively, to 75% in carcass wash water samples. Influenza A/H5N1 virus was detected in 79% of samples positive for influenza A virus and 35% of all samples collected. Sequence analysis of full-length haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from A/H5N1 viruses, and full-genome analysis of six representative isolates, revealed that the clade 1.1.2 reassortant virus associated with Cambodian human cases during 2013 was the only A/H5N1 virus detected during the year. However, multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HA and NA genes revealed co-circulation of at least nine low pathogenic AIVs from HA1, HA2, HA3, HA4, HA6, HA7, HA9, HA10 and HA11 subtypes. Four repeated serological surveys were conducted throughout the year in a cohort of 125 poultry workers.

Reporting of hospital-acquired infection rates has been introduced in multiple health care systems, but its relationship to infection rates has been understudied. Our objective was to determine whether mandatory public reporting by hospitals is associated with a reduction in hospital rates of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a longitudinal, population-based cohort study in Ontario (Canada\u0027s largest province) between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2010. We included all patients (\u003E1 y old) admitted to 180 acute care hospitals. Using Poisson regression, we developed a model to predict hospital- and age-specific monthly rates of C. difficile disease per 10,000 patient-days prior to introduction of public reporting on September 1, 2008. We then compared observed monthly rates of C. difficile infection in the post-intervention period with rates predicted by the pre-intervention predictive model. In the pre-intervention period there were 33,634 cases of C. difficile infection during 39,221,113 hospital days, with rates increasing from 7.01 per 10,000 patient-days in 2002 to 10.79 in 2007. In the first calendar year after the introduction of public reporting, there was a decline in observed rates of C. difficile colitis in Ontario to 8.92 cases per 10,000 patient-days, which was significantly lower than the predicted rate of 12.16 (95% CI 11.35\u201313.04) cases per 10,000 patient-days (p\u003C0.001). Over this period, public reporting was associated with a 26.7% (95% CI 21.4%\u201331.6%) reduction in C. difficile cases, or a projected 1,970 cases averted per year (95% CI 1,476\u20132,500). The effect was specific to C. difficile, with rates of community-acquired gastrointestinal infections and urinary tract infections unchanged. A limitation of our study is that this observational study design cannot rule out the influence of unmeasured temporal confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Public reporting of hospital C. difficile rates was associated with a substantial reduction in the population burden of this infection. Future research will be required to discern the direct mechanism by which C. difficile infection rates may have been reduced in response to public reporting.

There is strong evidence showing that nanomaterials not only interact with cells passively but also actively, mediating essential molecular processes for the regulation of cellular functions, but we are only starting to understand the mechanisms of those interactions. Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano\u2013bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties.

We investigated viral interference between hRSV and 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) in the ferret model. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 prevented subsequent infection with hRSV. Infection with hRSV reduced morbidity attributed to infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 but not infection, even when an increased inoculum dose of hRSV was used. Notably, infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune mediators in the ferret than hRSV. Minimal cross-reactive serological responses or interferon \u03B3\u2013expressing cells were induced by either virus \u226514 days after infection.

At present, the possible role of insects in the spread of AIV is dubious. The objective of the present work was to investigate the potential transmission of LPAIV by persistence of the virus in the alimentary tract of house flies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae). Flies were fed three virus concentrations of two AIV strains and then incubated at different temperatures for up to 24 h. The persistence of the two virus strains in the flies declined with increasing incubation temperatures and incubation periods. Similarly, increased virus uptake by the flies increased the persistence of virus. Persistence of infective AIV in flies differed significantly between the two virus strains.

To study Pneumocystis primary infection, 192 infants who were monitored for acute pulmonary disease or fever over a 40-month period were retrospectively investigated. P. jirovecii detection on archival nasopharyngeal aspirates was performed using a qPCR assay. Factors associated with P. jirovecii were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. P. jirovecii genotypes in infants and a control group of adults contemporaneously diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia were identified using unilocus, bilocus, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). P. jirovecii was detected in 35 infants (18.2%). The univariate analysis pointed out four factors: viral infection (P = .035, OR [IC 95], 2.2 [1.1\u20134.7]), lower respiratory tract infection (P = .032, OR [IC 95], 2.5 [1.1\u20135.9]), absence of hospital discharge after birth (P = .003, OR (IC 95), 0.1 (0.02\u20130.5]), and the 63\u2013189-day group (P \u003C .001, OR [IC 95], 42.2 [5.4\u2013332]). The multivariate analysis confirmed these two latter factors (P = .02, OR [IC 95], 0.1 [0.02\u20130.72]; P = .005, OR [IC 95], 11.5 [2.1\u201363.5]). Thus, P. jirovecii acquisition mostly takes place in the community. A comparison of these data with those of previously published studies showed that median and interquartile range of positive-infant ages were close to those observed in Chile, Denmark, and Peru, highlighting similar characteristics. Common unilocus or bilocus genotypes were identified in infants and adults, whereas no MLST genotypes were shared. Therefore, a common reservoir made up of infected infants and adults is still hypothetical. Finally, primary infection is a worldwide phenomenon occurring at the same time in childhood regardless of geographical location, rather than an incidental event.","publish_time":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nevez, Gilles; Guillaud-Saumur, Thibaud; Cros, Pierrick; Papon, Nicolas; Vallet, Sophie; Quinio, Doroth\u00E9e; Minoui-Tran, Adissa; Pilorg\u00E9, L\u00E9a; de Parscau, Lo\u00EFc; Sizun, Jacques; Ochoa, Theresa J; Bustamante, Beatriz; Ponce, Carolina; Vargas, Sergio L; Le Gal, Sol\u00E8ne","journal":"Med Mycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f3fd38c2f895ed0e2286b4d8f63b5e4568ef61a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107579.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MLST"],"locations":["Chile","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["jirovecii genotypes","infected infants","features of Pneumocystis primary infection","study Pneumocystis primary infection","viral infection","Factors","jirovecii detection","jirovecii acquisition","bilocus genotypes","MLST genotypes","Pneumocystis pneumonia","lower respiratory tract infection","control group of adults","Data","Common unilocus","univariate analysis","multivariate analysis","common reservoir","day group","multivariate analyses","interquartile range of positive","fever","time","infant ages","archival nasopharyngeal aspirates","infancy","geographical location","published studies","Peru","birth","multilocus sequence","worldwide phenomenon","acute pulmonary disease","absence of hospital discharge","Denmark","Chile","childhood","place","similar characteristics","incidental event","qPCR assay","month period","community","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Primary transcripts were mapped under various hormonal and substratum conditions using the technique of nuclear run-on transcription and single stranded sense and antisense probes spanning the \u03B2-casein gene. In the presence of insulin alone very little sense transcription is detectable, but antisense transcription is observed, which originates at least 150 basepairs upstream of the normal start site of transcription and is present regardless of hormonal, cell substratum, cell type, or gene activity. Antisense transcription is also detectable in the 3\u2032 end of the gene. Insulin, glucocorticoids, and PRL are all necessary for a maximal increase in transcription. A 2- to 4-fold increase in transcriptional activity is observed in the presence of insulin and PRL compared to insulin alone, and this is accompanied by a 125-fold increase in the level of \u03B2-casein mRNA. All three hormones act synergistically to induce a 10-fold increase in transcriptional activity, but the transcriptional increase across the gene is not equimolar. The 5\u03B2 half of the gene is transcribed at a level that is 2- to 10-fold lower than that of the 3\u03B2 half of the gene.

Respiratory virus infections have been recognized as important causes of severe pneumonia in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). Reported incidences of respiratory virus infection in adult SCT recipients vary in the literature from 3.5% to 36% when determined by viral culture. However, a more sensitive method to assess the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways may be important for delineation of the true incidence of respiratory virus\u2014associated pneumonia and may be essential for guidance on implementation of antiviral therapy and prevention or limitation of nosocomial spread of infection with respiratory viruses. Methods. To determine the incidence and severity of respiratory tract illness (RTI) and to assess the diagnostic value of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) versus viral culture, 72 SCT recipients were monitored during a 6-month period. Results. A respiratory virus was detected in 21% of episodes of RTI by viral culture and in 63% of RTI episodes by real-time RT-PCR (P \u003C .0001). In lower respiratory tract illness, real-time RT-PCR was much more sensitive than viral culture for detection of respiratory virus (73% vs. 9%; P = .008). The mortality rate for patients with respiratory virus\u2014associated lower respiratory tract illness (25%) was similar to rates reported elsewhere. Respiratory viruses (predominantly rhinovirus) were detected by real-time RT-PCR in 9% of samples obtained from symptom-free SCT recipients at predetermined times by real-time RT-PCR and by viral culture in 1% (P \u003C .0001), indicating that asymptomatic shedding of respiratory viruses also occurs. Conclusion. We conclude that, although asymptomatic shedding of respiratory virus occurs, respiratory viruses are frequent causes of RTI in SCT recipients.","publish_time":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kraaij, Marian G.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than current standard microbiological methods and, therefore, may improve the accuracy of microbiological diagnosis for patients with CAP. Methods. Conventional detection techniques and multiplex real-time PCR for atypical bacteria and respiratory viruses were performed on samples collected from 105 adults enrolled in a prospective study. An infiltrate was visible on each patient\u0027s chest radiograph, and a pneumonia severity index score was determined for each patient. Results. Microbiological diagnoses were determined for 52 (49.5%) of 105 patients by conventional techniques and for 80 (76%) of 105 patients by real-time PCR. The time to obtain the result of real-time PCR could be reduced to 6 h. PCR methodology was significantly more sensitive for the detection of atypical pathogens and viruses (P \u2A7D .001).

Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a recently discovered human coronavirus found to cause respiratory illness in children and adults that is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Methods. We investigated the role that HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E played in children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong during the period from August 2001 through August 2002. Results. Coronavirus infections were detected in 26 (4.4%) of 587 children studied; 15 (2.6%) were positive for HCoV-NL63, 9 (1.5%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, and 2 (0.3%) were positive for HCoV-229E. In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, and high fever. The mean age (\u00B1 standard deviation [SD]) of the infected children was 30.7 \u00B1 19.8 months (range, 6\u201357 months). The mean maximum temperature (\u00B1SD) for the 12 children who were febrile was 39.3\u00B0C \u00B1 0.9\u00B0C, and the mean total duration of fever (\u00B1SD) for all children was 2.6 \u00B1 1.2 days (range, 1\u20135 days). HCoV-NL63 infections were noted in the spring and summer months of 2002, whereas HCoV-OC43 infection mainly occurred in the fall and winter months of 2001. HCoV-NL63 viruses appeared to cluster into 2 evolutionary lineages, and viruses from both lineages cocirculated in the same season. Conclusions. HCoV-NL63 is a significant pathogen that contributes to the hospitalization of children, and it was estimated to have caused 224 hospital admissions per 100,000 population aged \u2A7D6 years each year in Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiu, Susan S.; Hung Chan, Kwok; Wing Chu, Ka; Kwan, See Wai; Guan, Yi; Man Poon, Leo Lit; Peiris, J.

Methods. To determine the prevalences of 11 viruses\u2014respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, hMPV, HCoV, HCoV-NL63, and HBoV\u2014among infants or children with LRTIs, in association with their epidemiologic characteristics, we performed multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from 515 children 5 years old with LRTIs during the period 2000\u20132005. Results. Viruses were identified in 312 (60.6%) of the 515 patients.

Bronchiolitis was frequently diagnosed in patients who tested positive for RSV, PIV-3, or rhinovirus, whereas influenza A, PIV-1, and HCoV-NL63 were commonly found in patients with croup. The age distributions of patients with viral infections differed; notably, RSV was responsible for 77% of LRTIs that occurred in infants 3 months old. The number of hMPV infections peaked between February and April, whereas the number of HCoV-NL63 infections peaked between April and May. Conclusions. This study describes the features of LRTIs associated with newly identified viruses in children, compared with those associated with known viruses.

Bacteria are found in 50%\u201390% of cases of acute otitis media (AOM) with or without otorrhea, and viruses are found in 20%\u201349% of cases. However, for at least 15% of patients with AOM, the microbiological etiology is never determined. Our aim was to specify the full etiology of acute middle ear infection by using modern microbiological methods concomitantly for bacterial and viral detection. Methods. The subjects were 79 young children having AOM with new onset (\u003C48 h) of otorrhea through a tympanostomy tube. Middle ear fluid samples were suctioned from the middle ear through the tympanostomy tube. Bacteria were sought by culture and polymerase chain reaction; viruses were analyzed by culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction. Results. At least 1 respiratory tract pathogen was noted in 76 children (96%). Bacteria were found in 73 cases (92%), and viruses were found in 55 (70%). In 52 patients (66%), both bacteria and viruses were found. Bacteria typical of AOM were detected in 86% of patients. Picornaviruses accounted for 60% of all viral findings. Conclusions. In the great majority of children, AOM is a coinfection with bacteria and viruses. The patent tympanostomy tube does not change the spectrum of causative agents in AOM.

Methods: RNA samples isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA; n = 170) and stool (n = 44) were reverse-transcribed and tested by our in-house conventional RT-PCR assay. We selected 98 NPA and 37 stool samples collected at different times after the onset of disease and tested them in a real-time quantitative RT-PCR specific for the open reading frame (ORF) 1b region of SARS CoV. Detection rates for the conventional and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were compared. To investigate the nature of viral RNA molecules in these clinical samples, we determined copy numbers of ORF 1b and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences of SARS CoV. Results: The quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS CoV in samples collected early in the course of the disease. Real-time assays targeted at the ORF 1b region and the N gene revealed that copy numbers of ORF 1b and N gene sequences in clinical samples were similar. Conclusions: NPA and stool samples can be used for early diagnosis of SARS. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS CoV is potentially useful for early detection of SARS CoV.

We focused on using synthetic peptides for developing antibodies against SARS-CoV, which aimed to block viral invasion by eliciting an immune response specific to the native SARS-CoV S protein. Methods: Six peptide sequences corresponding to the surface regions of SARS-CoV S protein were designed and investigated by use of combined bioinformatics and structural analysis. These synthetic peptides were used to immunize both rabbits and monkeys. Antisera collected 1 week after the second immunization were analyzed by ELISA and tested for antibody specificity against SARS-CoV by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Results: Four of our six synthetic peptides (S2, S3, S5, and S6) elicited SARS-CoV-specific antibodies, of which S5 (residues 788\u2013820) and S6 (residues 1002\u20131030) exhibited immunogenic responses similar to those found in a parallel investigation using truncated recombinant protein analogs of the SARS-CoV S protein. This suggested that our S5 and S6 peptides may represent two minimum biologically active sequences of the immunogenic regions of the SARS-CoV S protein.

We investigated whether the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be detected in serum and plasma samples during the early stages of SARS and studied the potential prognostic implications of such an approach. Methods: We developed two real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays, one for the polymerase and the other for the nucleocapsid region of the virus genome, for measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV RNA in serum/plasma samples from SARS patients. Plasma samples were obtained from 12 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, as well as on days 7 and 14 after fever onset. Serum samples were also obtained from 23 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, 11 of whom subsequently required intensive care. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma/serum samples. The extracted RNA was subjected to analysis by the RT-PCR assays. Results: The RT-PCR system for the polymerase region detected SARS-CoV RNA in 50% of plasma and 78% of serum samples from SARS patients during the first week of illness. The detection rates for plasma dropped to 25% at day 14 after fever onset. The median serum SARS-CoV concentrations in patients who required and did not require intensive care unit admission during the course of hospitalization were 5800 and 140 copies/mL, respectively (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P \u003C0.005). These data were confirmed by the RT-PCR system for the nucleocapsid region, which showed an even higher detection rate of 87%.

However, few community-based studies have been published and the true PeV infection burden is unknown. We investigated PeV epidemiology in healthy children participating in a community-based, longitudinal birth cohort study. METHODS: Australian children (n = 158) enrolled in the Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study were followed from birth until their second birthday. Weekly stool and nasal swabs and daily symptom diaries were collected. Swabs were tested for PeV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and genotypes determined by subgenomic sequencing. Incidence rate, infection characteristics, clinical associations, and virus codetections were investigated. RESULTS: PeV was detected in 1423 of 11 124 (12.8%) and 17 of 8100 (0.2%) stool and nasal swabs, respectively. Major genotypes among the 306 infection episodes identified were PeV-A1 (47.9%), PeV-A6 (20.1%), and PeV-A3 (18.3%). The incidence rate was 144 episodes (95% confidence interval, 128\u2013160) per 100 child-years. First infections appeared at a median age of 8 (interquartile range, 6.0\u201311.7) months. Annual seasonal peaks changing from PeV-A1 to PeV-A3 were observed. Infection was positively associated with age \u22656 months, summer season, nonexclusive breastfeeding at age \u003C3 months, and formal childcare attendance before age 12 months. Sole PeV infections were either asymptomatic (38.4%) or mild (32.7%), while codetection with other viruses in stool swabs was common (64.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with hospital-based studies, this study showed that diverse and dynamically changing PeV genotypes circulate in the community causing mild or subclinical infections in children. Parechovirus can cause severe illnesses in children. However, studies focus mainly on hospitalized populations. True disease burden in the community remains largely unknown. From our community-based cohort, we found diverse parechovirus genotypes in the community, causing mild or subclinical infections in children.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Claire Y T; Ware, Robert S; Lambert, Stephen B; Mhango, Lebogang P; Tozer, Sarah; Day, Rebecca; Grimwood, Keith; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405005ff99bd9c4c0bebe922997e3d3100713a00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108192.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PeV-A3","PeV-A1","PeV epidemiology","PeV-A6","changing PeV genotypes","Sole PeV infections","true PeV infection burden","community-based studies","community-based cohort","months","Hospital-based studies","stool swabs","subclinical infections","young children","healthy children","Australian children","diverse parechovirus genotypes","infection episodes","nasal swabs","median age","Major genotypes","infection characteristics","important cause of severe infections","longitudinal birth cohort study","Weekly stool","Incidence rate","True disease burden","severe illnesses","clinical associations","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","Childhood Infectious Diseases","ORChID","nonexclusive breastfeeding","summer season","formal childcare attendance","daily symptom diaries","Observational Research","viruses","contrast","Annual seasonal peaks","virus codetections","subgenomic sequencing","interquartile range","METHODS","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","hospitalized populations","child-years","birthday","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about unrecognized viruses of the urinary tract that potentially result in transmission. Using an open metagenomic approach, we aimed to comprehensively assess virus transmission in living-donor kidney transplantation. METHODS: Living kidney donors and their corresponding recipients were enrolled at the time of transplantation. Follow-up study visits for recipients were scheduled 4\u20136 weeks and 1 year thereafter. At each visit, plasma and urine samples were collected and transplant recipients were evaluated for signs of infection or other transplant-related complications. For metagenomic analysis, samples were enriched for viruses, amplified by anchored random polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Viruses detected by sequencing were confirmed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 30 living kidney donor and recipient pairs, with a follow-up of at least 1 year. In addition to viruses commonly detected during routine post-transplant virus monitoring, metagenomic sequencing detected JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) in the urine of 7 donors and their corresponding recipients. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed infection with the donor strain in 6 cases, suggesting transmission from the transplant donor to the recipient, despite recipient seropositivity for JCPyV at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic sequencing identified frequent transmission of JCPyV from kidney transplant donors to recipients. Considering the high incidence rate, future studies within larger cohorts are needed to define the relevance of JCPyV infection and the donor\u2019s virome for transplant outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schreiber, Peter W; Kufner, Verena; H\u00FCbel, Kerstin; Schmutz, Stefan; Zagordi, Osvaldo; Kaur, Amandeep; Bayard, Cornelia; Greiner, Michael; Zbinden, Andrea; Capaul, Riccarda; B\u00F6ni, J\u00FCrg; Hirsch, Hans H; Mueller, Thomas F; Mueller, Nicolas J; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97b248fe02f9107a2dc24f772ab05c6ce2638289.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e8c12fcedbed6ada28574e64cfe209b48f8549b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transplant recipients","kidney transplant donors","kidney donors","living kidney donor","living-donor kidney transplantation","corresponding recipients","transplant outcomes","metagenomic analysis","frequent transmission of JCPyV","virus transmission","high-throughput metagenomic sequencing","time of transplantation","relevance of JCPyV infection","transplant-related complications","donor strain","unrecognized viruses","open metagenomic approach","routine post-transplant virus monitoring","recipient pairs","recipient seropositivity","signs of infection","urine samples","year","detected JC polyomavirus","real-time PCR","Phylogenetic analysis","high incidence rate","Follow-up study visits","future studies","anchored random polymerase chain reaction","donor\u2019s virome","larger cohorts","viral pathogens","urinary tract","total","CONCLUSIONS","cases","specific tests","plasma","BACKGROUND","addition","weeks","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

With the explosion of genetically engineered mice (GEM), new concerns over the impact of microbial agents have emerged because these rodents in many cases are more susceptible to disease than their inbred or outbred counterparts. Moreover, interaction between microbe and host and the resulting manifestation of disease conceivably differ between GEM and their inbred and outbred counterparts. As a result, infections may alter the GEM phenotype and confound interpretation of results and conclusions about mutated gene function. In addition, because GEM are expensive to produce and maintain, contamination by pathogens or opportunists has severe economic consequences. This review addresses how microbial infections may influence phenotype, how immunomodulation of the host as the result of induced mutations may modify host susceptibility to microbial infections, how novel host:microbe interactions have led to the development of new animal models for disease, how phenotype changes have led to the discovery of new pathogens, and new challenges associated with prevention and control of microbial infections in GEM. Although the focus is on naturally occurring infections, extensive literature on the use of GEM in studies of microbial pathogenesis also exists, and the reader is referred to this literature if microbial infection is a suspected culprit in phenotype alteration.","publish_time":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franklin, Craig L.","journal":"ILAR J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87fc628cc392d138ec48ad2a1d2c7508d1287517.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GEM phenotype","control of microbial infections","use of GEM","impact of microbial agents","studies of microbial pathogenesis","host susceptibility","novel host","new concerns","new challenges","phenotype changes","phenotype alteration","discovery of new pathogens","outbred counterparts","development of new animal models","resulting manifestation of disease","microbe interactions","laboratory rodents","extensive literature","result of induced mutations","interpretation of results","suspected culprit","conclusions","opportunists","prevention","mutated gene function","engineered mice","severe economic consequences","potential","contamination","scientists","immunomodulation","review addresses","explosion","cases","reader","addition","research","focus"],"language":"en"},

It spread rapidly to many countries and developing a SARS vaccine is now urgently required. In order to study the immunogenicity of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion as a vaccine candidate, we subcutaneously immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV with or without an adjuvant. We chose aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) as an adjuvant, because of its long safety history for human use. We observed that the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory B cells. With the addition of alum to the vaccine formula, serum IgG production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, though it was still insufficient to elicit serum IgA antibodies. Notably, the SARS-CoV virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus. Furthermore, the UV-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1) upon restimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV virion in vitro.

Golgi-targeted derivatives of activated ras were completely inactive in transformation assays. However, when examined in focus formation assays, transformation of NIH3T3 cells were seen with derivatives of ras(61L) containing a mutated E1 targeting sequence that results in plasma membrane localization. Removal of the lipid modification sites in and upstream of the CAAX motif did not abrogate the transforming activity of plasma membrane-localized ras(61L) derivatives, indicating that these lipid modifications are not essential for ras activity, as long as the protein is correctly localized to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the activity of integral membrane versions of ras(61L) was strictly dependent on a minimum distance between the transmembrane domain anchor region and the coding sequence of ras. Derivatives with only a 3-amino acid linker were inactive, while linkers of either 11- or 22-amino acids were sufficient to restore transforming activity. These results demonstrate that: (1) activated ras targeted to Golgi membranes is unable to cause transformation; (2) lipid modifications at the C-terminus are not required for the transforming activity of plasma membrane-anchored ras(61L) derivatives, and serve primarily a targeting function; (3) a transmembrane domain can effectively substitute for C-terminal modifications that would normally target ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, indicating that ras(61L) does not need to reversibly dissociate from the membrane as might be allowed by the normal lipidation; and (4) in order to function properly, there exists a critical distance that the ras protein must reside from the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"1997-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hart, Kristen C; Donoghue, Daniel J","journal":"Oncogene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebb33b727c09a42ae8af8c72db56b4658073d3ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAAX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ras activity","derivatives of ras","ras protein","target ras","ability of ras","transforming activity of plasma membrane-localized ras","transforming activity of plasma membrane-anchored ras","activity of integral membrane versions of ras","coding sequence of ras","Golgi-targeted derivatives of activated ras","plasma membrane localization","integral membrane proteins","absence of lipid modifications","transformation assays","Golgi membranes","targeting function","C-terminal modifications","transmembrane domain anchor region","lipid modification sites","cis-Golgi","results","transformation of NIH3T3 cells","fusion proteins","E1 protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus","minimum distance","mutated E1","cellular membranes","critical distance","amino acids","C-terminus","signal transduction pathways","focus formation assays","amino acid linker","IBV","inner surface","WT","linkers","Removal","CAAX motif","normal lipidation","order"],"language":"en"},

In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in \u226590% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseu-domonal \u03B2-lactam. Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (C(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(24)) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher C(max)/MIC or AUC(24)/MIC and C(max)/MPC or AUC(24)/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/ MPC or Cmax/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2012-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shams, Wael E.; Evans, Martin E.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11a5e6ef8d4c839c60d9a530b8181f4d28a1385f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["MIC","MPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MPC ratios","Newer fluoroquinolones","use of fluoroquinolones","effect of fluoroquinolones","high ratios","intermediate ratios","low ratios","emergence of resistance","Agents","setting of lower respiratory tract infections","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Higher C","therapy of lower respiratory tract infections","atypical respiratory pathogens","gemifloxacin","levofloxacin","moxifloxacin","result of dose administration","gatifloxacin","high-risk patients","clinical cure rates","clinical trials","alternative dose administration strategies","low-level resistant variants","better clinical outcome","number of pharmacokinetic parameters","specific pathogens","excellent choices","peak concentration","higher dosages","pharmacodynamic parameters","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Pharmacokinetic profiles","widespread use","low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria","excellent intrinsic activity","concentration-time curve","Moraxella catarrhalis","Haemophilus influenzae","evaluation of risk factors","mutant prevention concentrations","acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis","combination","bacterial killing","Cmax","basis of anticipated organisms","admission","hospitalisation","community","attributes","susceptibility","monotherapy","AUC24","antipseu-domonal \u03B2-lactam","hour area","antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone","experiments","Innovative approaches","ciprofloxacin","Enterobacteriaceae","intensive care","relationship","end","potential of toxicity","class","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

In the preparations derived from human leucocytes or cultured B lymphoblastoid cells, which are in routine clinical use, mixtures of a number of distinct subtypes of human IFN\u03B1 have been identified. There are also 3 slightly different verrions of the same single subtype, IFN\u03B1-2, made by recombinant DNA procedures in bacteria. IFN\u03B1 preparations are injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Dose-related side effects are common but usually tolerable, but prolonged treatment may cause increasing fatigue and depression. Some patients form neutralising antibodies which block the effects of the IFN; these appear to be relatively more common after recombinant IFN\u03B1-2 than after IFN derived from human cells. Given intranasally, IFT\u03B1 can prevent a subsequent experimental rhinovirus infection, or the spread of natural colds within a family. Repeated administration progressively damages the nasal mucosa, so that long term prophylaxis is not possible. IFN\u03B1 has proved useful in patients with papillomavirus warts of the larynx, ano-genital region (condyloma acuminata) and skin (common warts). Treatment regimens remain to be optimised and are likely to include surgery or other treatments. IFN\u03B1 and zidovudine (azidothymidine) synergistically inhibit the growth of HIV in vitro, and combination are on trial in patients with early AIDS. Very large doses of IFN\u03B1 are effective against Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in some AIDS patients. In chronic hepatitis B, continuing virus replication may lead to cirrhosis or primary liver cancer. Earlier clinical trials with IFN\u03B1 gave inconclusive results, but recent large studies have confirmed that 25 to 40% of patients obtain benefit; this probably results from both the antiviral and the immunomodulatory effects of IFN\u03B1. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the biochemical markers usually improve rapidly during IFN\u03B1 administration, but relapse if treatment is stopped after only a few months; to increase the chances of sustained cure, the treatment period is now being prolonged.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finter, N.

Although considerable research for over two decades has been going on in this area, bibliometric studies to gauge the state of research of this field have been rare. An analysis of 2631 articles, extracted from WoS databases on Hantavirus between 1980 and 2014, indicated a progressive increase (R (2) = 0.93) in the number of papers over the years, with the majority of papers being published in the USA and Europe. About 95 % papers were co-authored and the most common arrangement was 4\u20136 authors per paper. Co-authorship has seen a steady increase (R (2) = 0.57) over the years. We apply research collaboration network analysis to investigate the best-connected authors in the field. The author-based networks have 49 components (connected clump of nodes) with 7373 vertices (authors) and 49,747 edges (co-author associations) between them. The giant component (the largest component) is healthy, occupying 84.19 % or 6208 vertices with 47,117 edges between them. By using edge-weight threshold, we drill down into the network to reveal bonded communities. We find three communities\u2019 hotspots\u2014one, led by researchers at University of Helsinki, Finland; a second, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA; and a third, led by Hokkaido University, Japan. Significant correlation was found between author\u2019s structural position in the network and research performance, thus further supporting a well-studied phenomenon that centrality effects research productivity. However, it was the PageRank centrality that out-performed degree and betweenness centrality in its strength of correlation with research performance.","publish_time":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Sameer; Markscheffel, Bernd","journal":"Scientometrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21945ab68a3223e3fb4d17fc525ebddacad185fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozkw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Helsinki, Finland","Centers of Disease Control"],"locations":["Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["research performance","state of research","considerable research","research collaboration network analysis","centrality effects research productivity","hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","betweenness centrality","best-connected authors","PageRank centrality","Europe","edges","vertices","field","number of papers","majority of papers","years","renal syndrome","strength of correlation","Significant correlation","largest component","steady increase","giant component","University of Helsinki","progressive increase","Hokkaido University","Hemorrhagic fever","main types of diseases","components","well-studied phenomenon","author\u2019s structural position","tens of thousands","Asia","people","connected clump of nodes","etiologic agents","degree","humans","author-based networks","researchers","Prevention","excreta","Centers of Disease Control","bibliometric studies","deadliest viruses","Finland","articles","Co-authorship","WoS databases","infected rodents","co-author associations","common arrangement","edge-weight threshold","area","Japan","Americas","bonded communities","decades","communities\u2019 hotspots","fatality rate"],"language":"en"},

Despite recent progress in understanding the immune conditions of abdominal sepsis, the postoperative incidence of septic complications after major visceral surgery remains high. This review focuses on the clinical and immunological parameters that determine the risk of the development and lethal outcome of postoperative septic complication following major surgery and trauma. A review of the literature indicates that surgical and traumatic injury profoundly affects the innate and adaptive immune responses, and that a marked suppression in cell-mediated immunity following an excessive inflammatory response appears to be responsible for the increased susceptibility to subsequent sepsis. The innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated and modulated by pathogen-associated molecular-pattern molecules and by damage-associated molecular-pattern molecules through the pattern-recognition receptors. Suppression of cell-mediated immunity may be caused by multifaceted cytokine/inhibitor profiles in the circulation and other compartments of the host, excessive activation and dysregulated recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, induction of alternatively activated or regulatory macrophages that have anti-inflammatory properties, a shift in the T-helper (Th)1/Th2 balance toward Th2, appearance of regulatory T cells, which are potent suppressors of the innate and adaptive immune system, and lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with sepsis. Recent basic and clinical studies have elucidated the functional effects of surgical and traumatic injury on the immune system. The research studies of interest may in future aid in the selection of appropriate therapeutic protocols.","publish_time":"2010-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kimura, Fumio; Shimizu, Hiroaki; Yoshidome, Hiroyuki; Ohtsuka, Masayuki; Miyazaki, Masaru","journal":"Surg Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32b80a7c580804ce09fa93937ccc4fd5e1b1b9b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major surgery","adaptive immune system","adaptive immune responses","immune conditions of abdominal sepsis","major visceral surgery","subsequent sepsis","Severe sepsis","molecular-pattern molecules","major causes of postoperative morbidity","major hepatobiliary pancreatic surgery","traumatic injury","cell-mediated immunity","clinical studies","Suppression of cell","review","postoperative incidence of septic complications","pattern-recognition receptors","lethal outcome of postoperative septic complication","excessive activation","appearance of regulatory T cells","Th2 balance","regulatory macrophages","T-helper","marked suppression","research studies","recent progress","excessive inflammatory response","functional effects of surgical","mortality","dysregulated recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils","induction","host","potent suppressors","lymphocyte apoptosis","damage","circulation","risk","future aid","compartments","multifaceted cytokine","development","organ failure","inhibitor profiles","anti-inflammatory properties","selection of appropriate therapeutic protocols","shift","increased susceptibility","patients","literature","pathogen","immunological parameters"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we outline different safe and proven dosing schemes of amiodarone and compare the incidence and description of pulmonary toxicity. Reason for this is a case of fatal pulmonary toxicity due to a subacute iatrogenic overdosing of amiodarone in a 74-year-old male patient with known severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and ectopic atrial tachycardia with reduced function of kidneys and liver but without preexisting lung disease.

METHODS: RPMVECs were isolated and the mRNA and protein levels of different toll-like receptors (TLR) were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The LPS-induced expressions of TLR4, TNF-\u03B1 and iNOS were analyzed in RPMVECs treated with different concentrations of simvastatin for different times. NF-\u03BAB activation was examined by immuofluroscence, luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. RESULTS: TLR4 is abundantly expressed in RPMVECs, and its expression is induced by LPS stimulation. Simvastatin inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner (p\u003C0.01), and alleviated inflammation in RPMVECs by inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03B1 and iNOS.

It influences all aspects of the life of affected individuals including social interactions, intimate relationships, family relations, peer interactions, education, employment, spirituality and religiosity. The clinical manifestations of sickle cell anaemia are protean and fall into three major categories: (i) anaemia and its sequelae; (ii) pain and related issues; and (iii) organ failure including infection. Recent studies on the pathogenesis of sickle cell anaemia have centred on the sequence of events that occur between polymerisation of deoxy haemoglobin (Hb) S and vaso-occlusion. Cellular dehydration, inflammatory response and reperfusion injury seem to be important pathophysiological mechanisms. Management of sickle cell anaemia continues to be primarily palliative in nature, including supportive, symptomatic and preventative approaches to therapy. Empowerment and education are the major aspects of supportive care. Symptomatic management includes pain management, blood transfusion and treatment of organ failure. Pain managment should follow certain priniciples that include assessment, individualisation of therapy and proper utilisation of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in order to acheive adequate pain relief. Blood selected for transfusion should be leuko-reduced and phenotypically matched for the C, E and Kell antigens. Exchange transfusion is indicated in patients who are transfused chronically in order to prevent or delay the onset of iron-overload. Acute chest syndrome is the most common form of organ failure and its management should be agressive, including adequate ventilation, multiple antibacterials and simple or exchange blood transfusion depending on its severity. Preventitive therapy includes prophylactic penicillin in infants and children, blood transfusion (preferably exchange transfusion) in patients with stroke, and hydroxyurea in patients with frequent acute painful episodes. Bone marrow and cord blood transplantation have been successful modalities of curative therapy in selected children with sickle cell anaemia. Newer approaches to preventative therapy include cellular rehydration with agents that inhibit the Gardos channel or the KCl co-transport channel. Curative gene therapy continues to be investigational at the level of the test tube and transgenic mouse models.","publish_time":"2012-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballas, Samir K.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46b07e0e6a827aa42b2ba3c4c8fac68d3c6e208d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Management of sickle cell anaemia","exchange blood transfusion","Exchange transfusion","pathogenesis of sickle cell anaemia","preventative therapy","pain management","patients","clinical manifestations of sickle cell anaemia","phenotypic expression of sickle cell anaemia","individualisation of therapy","Preventitive therapy","Curative gene therapy","Symptomatic management","successful modalities of curative therapy","Pain managment","cord blood transplantation","treatment of organ failure","education","acheive adequate pain relief","order","selected children","preventative approaches","common form of organ failure","major aspects of supportive care","social interactions","peer interactions","adequate ventilation","Gardos channel","cellular rehydration","Cellular dehydration","Newer approaches","major categories","non-opioid analgesics","proper utilisation of opioid","Acute chest syndrome","KCl co-transport channel","frequent acute painful episodes","intimate relationships","family relations","reperfusion injury","multiple antibacterials","infants","Hb","life of affected individuals","hydroxyurea","agents","test tube","prophylactic penicillin","polymerisation of deoxy haemoglobin","inflammatory response","certain priniciples","employment","assessment","agressive","transgenic mouse models","level","spirituality","Bone marrow","palliative","stroke","important pathophysiological mechanisms","vaso-occlusion","sequence of events","Recent studies","Kell antigens","religiosity","nature","Empowerment","severity","onset of iron","related issues","overload","infection","sequelae","leuko"],"language":"en"},

Upon signal peptide removal, the resulting 55-residue isoform, proapelin/apelin-55, can be further processed to 36-, 17-, or 13-residue isoforms with length-dependent pharmacological properties. Processing was initially proposed to occur intracellularly. However, detection of apelin-55 in extracellular fluids indicates that extracellular processing may also occur. To test for this, apelin-55 was applied exogenously to HEK293A cells overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 3 (PCSK3), the only apelin processing enzyme identified thus far, and to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which endogenously express apelin, PCSK3 and other proprotein convertases. Analysis of culture media constituents from each cell type by high performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and western blot demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in apelin-55 levels. This decrease was partially, but not fully, attenuated by PCSK inhibitor treatment in both cell lines. Comparison of the resulting apelin-55-derived peptide profile between the two cell lines demonstrated distinct processing patterns, with apelin-36 production apparent in 3T3-L1 adipocytes vs. detection of the prodomain of a shorter isoform (likely the apelin-13 prodomain, observed after additional proteolytic processing) in PCSK3-transfected HEK293A cells. Extracellular processing of apelin, with distinct cell type dependence, provides an alternative mechanism to regulate isoform-mediated physiological effects of apelin.

ACE2 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of distal renal tubules, and recent evidence indicates that expression is increased in a range of renal diseases. A soluble form of ACE, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form, has been shown to be present in urine; although evidence for a similar release of ACE2 has been reported in cell culture, it is not yet known whether this occurs in vivo. The present study has identified ACE2 in human urine, both by a sensitive fluorescence-based activity assay and by Western immunoblot. Levels of ACE2 were surprisingly higher than ACE, which may reflect preferential targeting of the enzyme to the luminal surface of the renal epithelium. Future studies will determine whether increased expression of ACE2 in renal diseases are reflected in higher urinary levels of this novel enzyme.","publish_time":"2006-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lew, Rebecca A.; Warner, Fiona J.; Hanchapola, Iresha; Smith, A.

Accordingly, anaphylatoxins generated after complement system activation, factors of coagulation and fibrinolysis, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, lipid mediators, nitric oxide, and cell markers of stress (eg, high mobility group box-1) have been shown to contribute to the deleterious events observed during sepsis. On the other hand, the counterregulation of the inflammatory process, which involves mediators such as anti-inflammatory cytokines and some neuromediators, can jeopardize the immune status of the host and render the patients more sensitive to nosocomial infections.","publish_time":"2007-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philippart, Fran\u00E7ois; Cavaillon, Jean-Marc","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7277ad2854ce0eb4d0d598654dfd14c879f5651.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sepsis","lipid mediators","mediators responsible","cell markers of stress","plasma levels of numerous inflammatory markers","proinflammatory cytokines","anti-inflammatory cytokines","inflammatory process","proteases","nitric oxide","fibrinolysis","chemokines","factors of coagulation","gene-targeted animals","system activation","patients","host","use of neutralizing agents","high mobility group box","neuromediators","experimental models","nosocomial infections","immune status","counterregulation","organ dysfunction","syndromes","death","role","anaphylatoxins","hand","deleterious events"],"language":"en"},

In our cohort, anemia due to pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) occurred in 15/22 (68%) of cases, being the most common indication for treatment. Neutropenia was only found in 8/22 (36%) cases, and recurrent infections, the most important clinical problem in Western patients, were not observed. None of our cases presented with rheumatoid arthritis. These clinical features were consistently observed when compared with the 88 other Asian patients. Combined data from our cohort and other Asian cases showed that Asian patients, compared with Western patients, had more frequent anemia (66/110, 60% versus 113/240, 47%; p = 0.044), attributable to a much higher incidence of PRCA (52/110, 47% versus 6/143, 4%; p \u003C 0.001). However, Western patients presented more frequently than Asian patients with neutropenia (146/235, 62% versus 33/110, 30%; p \u003C 0.001) and splenomegaly (99/246, 40% versus 16/110, 15%; p \u003C 0.001).

Mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (CM) has been reported to attenuate lung injury. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), a type of multipotent stem cells, are more easily obtained than mesenchymal stem cells. We hypothesize that NCSC-CM has anti-inflammatory properties that could protect against IR-induced lung injury in rats. In this study, NCSC-CM was derived from rat NCSCs. Typical acute lung injury was induced by 30-min ischemia followed by 90-min reperfusion in adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to analyze the degree of lung injury after the experiment. NCSC-CM was administered before ischemia and after reperfusion. NCSC-CM treatment significantly attenuated IR-induced lung edema, as indicated by decreases in pulmonary vascular permeability, lung weight gain, wet to dry weight ratio, lung weight to body weight ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, and protein level in BALF. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-6 in the BALF were also significantly decreased. Additionally, NCSC-CM improved lung pathology and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissue, and significantly suppressed nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB activity and I\u03BAB-\u03B1 degradation in the lung. However, heating NCSC-CM eliminated these protective effects. Our experiment demonstrates that NCSC-CM treatment decreases IR-induced acute lung injury and that the protective mechanism may be attributable to the inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation and the inflammatory response. Therefore, NCSC-CM may be a novel approach for treating IR-induced lung injury.","publish_time":"2017-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Chung-Kan; Wu, Shu-Yu; Tang, Shih-En; Li, Min-Hui; Lin, Shih-Shiuan; Chu, Shi-Jye; Huang, Kun-Lun","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f98a3f37c8ecb63fae752eaa0a96cd65b924351.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102066.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IR-induced lung injury","lung tissues","degree of lung injury","lung weight gain","Typical acute lung injury","attenuated IR-induced lung edema","improved lung pathology","heating NCSC","mesenchymal stem cells","BALF","ischemia-reperfusion","body weight ratio","dry weight ratio","type of multipotent stem cells","Neural crest stem cells","experiment","Mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium","\u03BAB activity","\u03BAB activation","inhibition of NF","nuclear factor","Dawley rats","protective mechanism","protective effects","rat NCSCs","levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","pulmonary arterial pressure","pulmonary vascular permeability","I\u03BAB-\u03B1 degradation","neutrophil infiltration","adult male Sprague","protein level","interleukin","Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","novel approach","inflammatory response","Current treatments","anti-inflammatory properties","study"],"language":"en"},

Male Wistar rats were rendered endotoxemic by intra-peritoneal injection of LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). We examined the expression of protein and mRNA and the immunohistochemical localization of PAR isoforms in lung tissues 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS administration. Induction of ALI by LPS was confirmed based on histopathological changes. LPS administration induced significant increases in the expression of PAR isoforms (protein) at the level of transcription in ALI. While the time course of PAR-1 and -2 expressions were different, those of PAR-3 and -4 were almost similar. An immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of PAR isoforms in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. However, the cellular distribution patterns of PAR isoforms were different. We conclude that LPS induces increase in protein expression of PAR isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ALI.

However, there is no comprehensive study on the role of NOXs in high glucose (HG)-induced toxic effect in neural tissues. Recently, a therapeutic strategy in oxidative related pathologies has been introduced by blocking the undesirable actions of NOX enzymes by small molecules. The protective roles of Statins in ameliorating oxidative stress by NOX inhibition have been shown in some tissues except neural. We hypothesized then, that different NOXs may have role in HG-induced neural cell injury. Furthermore, we postulate that Atorvastatin as a small molecule may modulate this NOXs activity to protect neural cells. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with HG (140 mM/24 h) in the presence and absence of Atorvastatin (1 \u03BCM/96 h). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay and the gene and protein expressions profile of NOX (1\u20134) were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. Gene and protein expression levels of NOX (1\u20134) and consequently ROS and MDA levels were elevated in HG-treated PC12 cells. Atorvastatin could significantly decrease HG-induced NOXs, ROS and MDA elevation and improve impaired cell viability. It can be concluded that HG could elevate NOXs activity, ROS and MDA levels in neural tissues and Atorvastatin as a small molecule NOX inhibitor drug may prevent and delay diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy.","publish_time":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rayegan, Samira; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Sharifi, Ali Mohammad","journal":"Metab Brain Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15cb85573f9951cd1d647e3744c7be4d8fedf846.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102122.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NADPH","MTT","MDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HG-induced NOXs","Levels of ROS","neural tissues","MDA levels","neural cells","role of NOXs","NOXs activity","NOX inhibition","protein expression levels of NOX","HG-treated PC12 cells","different NOXs","neural cell injury","small molecule NOX inhibitor drug","MDA elevation","protein expressions profile of NOX","absence of Atorvastatin","various tissues","undesirable actions of NOX enzymes","gene","small molecules","impaired cell viability","Undifferentiated PC12 cells","oxidative stress","oxidative related pathologies","MTT assay","NADPH oxidase","activation","Overproduction of reactive oxygen species","essential mechanism","high glucose","toxic effect","therapeutic strategy","protective roles of Statins","hyperglycemia","diabetic complications","RT-PCR","western blotting","presence","\u03BCM","comprehensive study","malondialdehyde","neuropathy"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield, safety and impact of FB and BAL on management decisions in immunocompromised critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective, observational study of 106 non-HIV immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent FB with BAL. RESULTS: FB and BAL established the diagnosis in 38 (33%) of cases, and had a positive impact on management in 44 (38.3%) of cases. Escalation of ventilator support was not required in 94 (81.7%) of cases, while 18 (15.7%) required invasive and 3 (2.6%) required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation after the procedure. Three patients (2.6%) died within 24 h of bronchoscopy, and 46 patients (40%) died in ICU. Significant hypoxemia developed in 5% of cases.

Drotrecogin alfa (activated), activated protein C (APC), has been shown in a recent trial to decrease mortality from 44 to 31% in patients with SSS and a high risk of death. We present 3 patients who developed SSS after bariatric surgery and were treated with APC as part of comprehensive therapy for sepsis. Methods: At our institution, patients must have SSS plus an APACHE II score \u2265 25 in order to receive APC. JL is a 43-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II score 26) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. ML is a 33-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II=28) because of a distal obstruction 2.5 years after gastric bypass surgery. TQ was a 35-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II=35) in the setting of laparoscopic banding. Results: After receiving 90% of the 96-hour infusion, JL developed ecchymoses and a decrease in his platelet count; thus, the drug was stopped. ML received a full 96-hour infusion. Both patients made a full recovery from their SSS and were successfully discharged from the hospital. TQ developed septic shock and expired despite all efforts. Conclusion: Weight alone should not be considered a contraindication to the use of APC. Close coordination between the intensivist and surgeon is recommended for bariatric surgery patients with SSS, so that a rapid determination can be made as to the patient\u0027s risk of death and eligibility to receive APC.","publish_time":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savel, Richard H; Pulipati, Ravi C; Mangone-Cholewczynski, Connie; Lazzaro, Richard S; Macura, Jerzy M; Lehman, Herbert E","journal":"Obes Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea58cb2517e0841adad9765d1349da35fe2d80c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSS","APC","TQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SSS","APACHE","bariatric surgery patients","year-old man","use of APC","gastric bypass surgery","septic shock","score","JL","decrease","hour infusion","TQ","Y gastric bypass","high risk of death","patient\u0027s risk of death","associated mortality","Severe sepsis syndrome","surgeon","Roux-en","years","ecchymoses","distal obstruction","intensivist","Background","eligibility","platelet count","Close coordination","comprehensive therapy","institution","order","protein C","setting of laparoscopic banding","drug","recent trial","efforts","contraindication","Methods","rapid determination","recovery","Drotrecogin alfa","Conclusion","Weight","Results","hospital"],"language":"en"},

So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has hardly been reported. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in children worldwide and a substantial proportion of childhood CAP is caused by viruses. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of virus infection is important for the clinical management of CAP. In this study, we explored the GeXP assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in hospitalized children with CAP. A total of 1699 nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and viral nucleic acid was extracted and assayed. Using viral genomic DNA or RNA as template, we showed that at the concentration of 10(4) copies of DNA or RNA of each virus/\u03BCl, all 20 target viruses were simultaneously identified by the GeXP assay. Fifteen control microorganisms, in contrast, failed to be amplified by the assay. About 65% of cases tested in this study had viral infection, with patients aged \u003C3 years having a 70% positive rate, significantly higher than that in patients aged \u003E 3 years (40%). The most frequently detected virus was RSV followed by PIV3, HRV, ADV and HBoV. Seasonal distribution analysis revealed that RSV was the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages. One hundred twenty randomly-chosen samples tested by the GeXP assay were re-evaluated by mono-RT-PCR, the results showed 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods. Our findings suggest that the GeXP assay could be a valuable diagnostic tool for virus infection in pediatric patients with CAP.","publish_time":"2016-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Le; Zhao, Mengchuan; Shi, Zhongren; Feng, Zhishan; Guo, Weiwei; Yang, Shuo; Liu, Lanping; Li, Guixia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51448d629c1d530b3001bc292c2d819a71ecdf23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5023126.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27627439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","Rapid","RSV","ADV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GeXP assay","GeXP-based assay","viral infection","RSV","accurate diagnosis of virus infection","detected virus","RNA","study","viral genomic DNA","subtypes of viruses","pediatric patients","target viruses","years","larger clinical samples","viral nucleic acid","hospitalized children","summer PIV3","clinical management of","simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens","diagnosis agreement","copies of DNA","positive rate","similar positive percentages","substantial proportion of childhood CAP","valuable diagnostic tool","spring","leading cause of death","winter","results","total","autumn","HRV","template","mono-RT","\u03BCl","nasopharyngeal swabs","PCR","pneumonia","ADV","HBoV","Seasonal distribution analysis","control microorganisms","contrast","Community","methods","cases","findings","application","concentration"],"language":"en"},

We have previously described the identification of several sequence fragments with limited sequence identity to known astroviruses in a stool specimen obtained from a child with acute diarrhea, suggesting that a novel virus was present. RESULTS: In this study, the complete genome of this novel virus isolate was sequenced and analyzed. The overall genome organization of this virus paralleled that of known astroviruses, with 3 open reading frames identified. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORFs indicated that this virus is highly divergent from all previously described animal and human astroviruses. Molecular features that are highly conserved in human serotypes 1\u20138, such as a 3\u0027NTR stem-loop structure and conserved nucleotide motifs present in the 5\u0027NTR and ORF1b/2 junction, were either absent or only partially conserved in this novel virus. CONCLUSION: Based on the analyses described herein, we propose that this newly discovered virus represents a novel species in the family Astroviridae.

Most of these infections are caused by viruses, but are generally treated with antibiotics. Inappropriate use of antibiotics favors the selection, growth and spread of resistant bacteria; these bacteria colonize the airways and affect the entire community. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, respiratory infections have become more difficult to treat. Effective strategies are needed to restrict the use of antibiotics without harming children that truly need these drugs. AIM: to present a critical analysis of the results of randomized and controlled studies on clinical and laboratory criteria used in diagnosing and treating tonsillitis, sinusitis and otitis. METHODS: a review of randomized and controlled studies about these conditions published in MEDLINE and SCIELO from 2000 to 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Given that most of these infections progress favorably without antibiotics, the use of these drugs should be avoided unless the child belongs to a high risk group for complications, or symptoms persist or worsen with despite symptomatic treatment.

The platelet count reflects the thrombocyte turnover, acting as a sensitive indicator of illness severity that is of great clinical utility to monitor a quickly changing health condition of patients affected by aggressive viral infections. This study aims to investigate the significance of platelet count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients. Methods A total of 532 COVID-19 patients were involved in the cohort study from the First People\u0027s Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan from January 7, 2020, to February 28, 2020. We collected the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of patients. Patients still hospitalized before February 29, 2020, died on admission, with malignant tumors, previous gastrointestinal surgery, missing baseline platelet count, or platelet count detected only once, were excluded. We used a generalized additive model and generalized additive mixed model to compare trends in platelet count over time among survivors and non-survivors, with an adjustment for potential confounders. Results During the follow-up, twenty-nine subjects died (mortality rate, 5.45%). The platelets among non-survivors decreased and among survivors increased gradually within 1 week after admission. In addition, the difference between the two groups showed an increasing trend during 1 week after admission. This difference increased by an average of 5.3 \u00D7 10^9/L daily. Conclusions In the early stage, platelet count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. Early decrease in platelet count was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Causality, however, cannot be deduced from our data.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaofang; Wang, Kun; Zuo, Peiyuan; Liu, Yuwei; Zhang, Meng; Xie, Songpu; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Xinglin; Liu, Chengyun","journal":"The EPMA journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00208-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["First People\u0027s Hospital of Jiangxia District"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significance of platelet count","COVID","missing baseline platelet count","laboratory data of patients","health condition of patients","non-survivors","admission","generalized additive model","week","difference","additive mixed model","pathophysiological changes","clinical characteristics","Background Changes","early stage","Early decrease","cohort study","mortality rate","great clinical utility","previous gastrointestinal surgery","trends","time","malignant tumors","People\u0027s Hospital of Jiangxia District","sensitive indicator of illness severity","progression","thrombocyte turnover","Wuhan","subjects","increasing trend","aggressive viral infections","adjustment","disease","groups","follow-up","Conclusions","total","potential confounders","Results","Methods","platelets","addition","average","daily","Causality"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7\u201399.4]; P\u003C0.01). Conclusions Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.

The aim of this study was to describe the etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult SHLH. Fifty\u2010four adult patients who fulfilled the criteria of SHLH were enrolled in the study. Viral etiology, blood biomarkers, and clinical manifestations of SHLH were analyzed in these patients. Twenty\u2010four SHLH patients had viraemia, whereas 30 SHLH patients were secondary to other diseases. Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV) was the most common virus that associated SHLH among all viruses studied. Severe SHLH patients with EBV\u2010viraemia presented significantly high levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT).

Medical reports suggest that a direct contact with the secretion or respiratory droplets from a patient through a short distance is very likely to be the possible way of transmitting the disease. World Health Organization (WHO), hence, has advised international travellers to avoid visiting several regions that have the most number of SARS cases, including Hong Kong. Since then, the number of hotel guests has largely dropped to a level that Hong Kong has never experienced before. As a totally new experience to the hotel industry in Hong Kong and elsewhere, hoteliers basically do not have enough knowledge to respond to epidemic crisis. In view of the lack of published articles in the hospitality literature that examine the issue, this paper investigates the impact of the SARS outbreak on the hotel industry in Hong Kong.

The papain-like cysteine proteases encoded by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV: PLpro; NL63: PLP1 and PLP2) represent potential targets for antiviral drug development. Three recent inhibitor-bound PLpro structures highlight the role of an extremely flexible six-residue loop in inhibitor binding. The high binding site plasticity is a major challenge in computational drug discovery/design efforts. From conventional molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations, we find that with conventional molecular dynamics simulation, PLpro translationally samples the open and closed conformation of BL2 loop on a picosecond\u2013nanosecond timescale but does not reproduce the peptide bond inversion between loop residues Tyr269 and Gln270 that is observed on inhibitor GRL0617 binding. Only aMD simulation, starting from the closed loop conformation, reproduced the 180\u00B0 \u03D5\u2013\u03A8 dihedral rotation back to the open loop state. The Tyr\u2013Gln peptide bond inversion appears to involve a progressive conformational change of the full loop, starting at one side, and progressing to the other. We used the SARS-CoV apo X-ray structure to develop a model of the NL63-PLP2 catalytic site. Superimposition of the PLP2 model on the PLpro X-ray structure identifies binding site residues in PLP2 that contribute to the distinct substrate cleavage site specificities between the two proteases. The topological and electrostatic differences between the two protease binding sites also help explain the selectivity of non-covalent PLpro inhibitors.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaudhuri, Rima; Tang, Sishi; Zhao, Guijun; Lu, Hui; Case, David A.; Johnson, Michael E.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5692a8a106385686787b73c718b9d9991b96299e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e718e057d48c937a2ddbcd4a4a28c77ef728993c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ef9a0e0230ca01f2ac5ee240a2a3b60f5dd793df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3397151.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611010369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22004941/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611010369; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.09.030; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3397151?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitor binding","binding site residues","residue loop","closed loop conformation","PLpro X-ray structure","PLP2 model","loop residues Tyr269","NL63-PLP2 catalytic site","open loop state","inhibitor GRL0617 binding","closed conformation of BL2 loop","high binding site plasticity","conventional molecular dynamics simulation","protease binding sites","SARS-CoV apo X-ray structure","recent inhibitor-bound PLpro structures","NL63 coronaviruses","aMD simulation","selectivity of non-covalent PLpro inhibitors","Gln peptide bond inversion","human respiratory pathogens","antiviral drug development","distinct substrate cleavage site specificities","human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cysteine proteases","computational drug discovery","effective antiviral treatment","major challenge","potential targets","Gln270","PLP1","\u03A8 dihedral rotation","picosecond","design efforts","electrostatic differences","role","nanosecond timescale","progressive conformational change","simulations","papain","Superimposition"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections are known to trigger asthma exacerbations, but a thorough description of the clinical characteristics of ILI-associated asthma exacerbations and the role of viruses as a risk factor for severe exacerbation (SE) in ILI has not been published yet. Objective To investigate risk factors for SE in patients with ILI and asthma. Methods Patients with ILI symptoms were recruited from 6 hospitals of Mexico (LaRed sites) during 2010 to 2014. Those with a previous asthma diagnosis and ILI symptoms and who were 5 years or older were included. Patients were assigned as cases or controls based on symptoms reported. SE was defined when participants presented with wheezing or dyspnea and required hospitalization. Results A total of 486 patients with ILI and a diagnosis of asthma were included. There were no differences in the proportion, number, or type of viral illness among those with and without SE. Those with SE were less likely to report ILI symptoms. Muscle pain and nasal drip were predictors for patients not progressing to SE. A delay in seeking medical care was associated with SE (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.46-5.88). Conclusion The presence of a particular virus did not predict SE. ILI symptoms in asthma patients are not associated with severe exacerbation. Patients with asthma should be encouraged to seek early medical care when ILI symptoms are first noticed to prevent serious complications.","publish_time":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paulin-Prado, Paulina; Nishimura, Katherine; Freimanis-Hance, Laura; Hunsberger, Sally; Beigel, John; Fraga, Arturo Galindo; Hernandez, Ana A Ortiz; Llamosas-Gallardo, Beatriz; Moreno-Espinosa, Sarbelio; Maga\u00F1a-Aquino, Martin; Palacios, Guillermo M Ruiz; Ramirez-Venegas, Alejandra","journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma \u0026 Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/498cc1e1dfb7d2f3933a1fe58409156ec4297857.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7d27a534ba24ccf97f111ea25138dc6bf6cda2ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4860073.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4860073?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2016.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27052815/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S108112061630045X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108112061630045X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","SE"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["ILI symptoms","asthma patients","diagnosis of asthma","Methods Patients","associated asthma exacerbations","clinical characteristics of ILI","previous asthma diagnosis","Abstract Background Patients","risk factors","higher risk","severe exacerbation","early medical care","type of viral illness","Viral infections","serious complications","chronic inflammatory lung diseases","role of viruses","thorough description","number","nasal drip","predictors","particular virus","Muscle pain","hospitals of Mexico","influenza","wheezing","dyspnea","proportion","LaRed sites","Conclusion","presence","participants","odds ratio","Objective","delay","cases","controls","years","hospitalization","differences","total"],"language":"en"},

Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that it exhibits essentially the same (equilibrium) dynamics regardless of which of the two incidence functions is used. In particular, for each of the two incidence functions, the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction threshold quantity is less than unity. Further, it has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. For the case with the Holling type II incidence function, it is shown that the unique endemic equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable for a special case. The permanence of the disease is also established for the model with the Holling type II incidence function. Furthermore, it is shown that adding time delay to and/or replacing the standard incidence function with the Holling type II incidence function in the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model with standard incidence (considered in Safi and Gumel (2010) [10]) does not alter the qualitative dynamics of the autonomous system (with respect to the elimination or persistence of the disease). Finally, numerical simulations of the model with standard incidence show that the disease burden decreases with increasing time delay (incubation period). Furthermore, models with time delay seem to be more suitable for modeling the 2003 SARS outbreaks than those without time delay.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safi, Mohammad A.; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":"Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c88f017fa1f85bc094e66d4504eb5d4eb239443.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288639/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nonrwa.2010.06.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1468121810001306; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1468121810001306","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence functions","standard incidence function","isolation model","Holling type","increasing time delay","unique endemic equilibrium","qualitative dynamics","stable disease-free equilibrium","disease burden","asymptotic dynamics","unity","corresponding autonomous quarantine","associated reproduction threshold quantity","autonomous system","special case","Rigorous qualitative analysis","respect","elimination","SARS outbreaks","incubation period","subject","numerical simulations","persistence","Safi","problem","Gumel","models","permanence"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli. These organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines. Additionally, the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals. No commercial vaccine is available but various effective antivirals have been identified, some with potential for human treatment. These morphological airway cultures are also well suited for the identification of antivirals, evaluation of compound toxicity and viral inhibition.","publish_time":"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonsdottir, Hulda R.; Dijkman, Ronald","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1dde82e18ad108c7eedb452d50a661e647b7cf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4744394.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0479-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26852031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Air-Liquid Interface"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["human airway epithelium","Human coronaviruses","human airways","human treatment","human respiratory tract","organotypic human airway cultures","organotypic human airway culture system","non-human primates","primary entry point of human respiratory viruses","morphological airway cultures","respiratory virus-host interaction","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs","viral infection","Tracheobronchial HAE cultures","different mechanisms","various effective antivirals","identification of antivirals","Various animal models","different cell culture systems","large RNA viruses","alveolar model","common CoVs","virus family","elucidation of mechanisms","viral inhibition","HCoV infection","cell lines","epidemic potential","host immune response","ALI","humans","universal platform","evaluation of compound toxicity","Air-Liquid Interface","tropism","detailed insights","mice","HCoVs","yearly circulation","commercial vaccine","research","need","pathogenesis","importance","emergence","vaccines","alveoli","antiviral compounds","link"],"language":"en"},

These data also generated recommendations for future pandemic planning. Specifically, this paper will examine the perspectives and recommendations of children hospitalised during SARS in a large paediatric hospital in Canada. Twenty\u2010one (n = 21) child and adolescent participants were interviewed from a variety of medical areas including cardiac (n = 2), critical care (n = 2), organ transplant (n = 4), respiratory medicine (n = 8) and infectious diseases (patients diagnosed with suspected or probable SARS; n = 5). Data analyses exposed a range of children\u2019s experiences associated with the outbreaks as well as recommendations for future pandemic planning.

Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival. At any location, simulated virus survival was greater in winter than in summer, and in any month of the year, survival was higher in higher latitudes. At any location, year-to-year variation in virus survival 24 h post-excretion was substantial and was as large as the difference between locations. Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The within-year pattern of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years. The model examines the effect of temperature in isolation; actual virus survivability will reflect the effect of additional environmental factors.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scanlan, J.

The risk of infection or disease in a population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host, and the host population, as well as behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Viral disease epidemiology has come to have a major role in clarifying the etiologic role of particular viruses and viral variants as the cause of specific diseases, in improving our understanding of the overall nature of specific viral diseases, and in determining factors affecting host susceptibility and immunity, in unraveling modes of transmission, in clarifying the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, in determining the safety, efficacy, and utility of vaccines and antiviral drugs, and especially in alerting and directing disease prevention and control actions. Information on incidence, prevalence, and morbidity and mortality rates contributes directly to the establishment of priorities for prevention and control programs, whether this involves vaccine or drug development and delivery, environmental and hygienic improvements, enhancement of nutritional status, personal or community behavior, agricultural and food processing enhancements, reservoir host and vector control, and international cooperation and communication.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murphy, F.

Interestingly, an increasing number of sporadic cases of HEV infections are described in industrialized countries as zoonosis from domestic livestock. Despite the increasing relevance of this pathogen in clinical virology, commercial antibody assays are mainly based on fragments of HEV open reading frame (ORF) 2 and ORF3. The largest ORF1 (poly-)protein, however, is not part of current testing formats. METHODS: From a synthesized full length HEV genotype 1 cDNA-bank we constructed a complete HEV gene library consisting of 15 respective HEV ORF domains. After bacterial expression and purification of nine recombinant HEV proteins under denaturating conditions serum profiling experiments using 55 sera from patients with known infection status were performed in microarray format. SPSS software assessed the antigenic potential of these nine ORF domains in comparison to seven commercial HEV antigens (genotype 1 and 3) by performing receiver operator characteristics, logistic regression and correlation analysis. RESULTS: HEV antigens produced with our method for serum profiling experiments exhibit the same quality and characteristics as commercial antigens. Serum profiling experiments detected Y, V and X domains as ORF1-antigens with potentially comparable diagnostic significance as the well established epitopes of ORF2 and ORF3. However no obvious additional increase in sensitivity or specificity was achieved in diagnostic testing as revealed by bioinformatic analysis. Additionally we found that the C-terminal domain of the potential transmembrane protein ORF3 is responsible for IgG and IgM seroreactivity. Data suggest that there might be a genotype specific seroreactivity of homologous ORF2-antigens. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of identified ORF1 epitopes might not necessarily improve sensitivity and specificity, but broaden the overall quality of existing test systems. ORF2 and ORF3-antigens are still commonly used in diagnostic assays and possibly hold the potential to serologically differentiate between genotype 1 and 3 infections. Our systematic approach is a suitable method to investigate HEV domains for their serologic antigenicity. Epitope screening of native viral domains could be a preferable tool in developing new serologic test components.","publish_time":"2012-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osterman, Andreas; Vizoso Pinto, Maria Guadalupe; Haase, Rudolf; Nitschko, Hans; J\u00E4ger, Simone; Sander, Michaela; Motz, Manfred; Mohn, Ulrich; Baiker, Armin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56feb53034b99302ba30fa1c3e2042b2118fe6cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3274478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22269698/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-28","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The National Institutes of Health","HEV","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEV domains","commercial HEV antigens","length HEV genotype","ORF3-antigens","respective HEV ORF domains","ORF1-antigens","commercial antigens","recombinant HEV proteins","complete HEV gene library","X domains","diagnostic assays","diagnostic testing","increasing number of sporadic cases of HEV infections","fragments of HEV open reading frame","genotype specific seroreactivity of homologous ORF2-antigens","potential transmembrane protein ORF3","denaturating conditions serum profiling experiments","diagnostic value of identified ORF1 epitopes","Hepatitis E Virus","antigenic potential","comparable diagnostic significance","specificity","commercial antibody assays","established epitopes of ORF2","largest ORF1","sensitivity","developing countries","Epitope screening of native viral domains","National Institutes of Health classified Hepatitis E","major cause of acute hepatitis","industrialized countries","suitable method","new serologic test components","correlation analysis","IgM seroreactivity","increasing relevance","serologic antigenicity","bioinformatic analysis","overall quality of existing test systems","receiver operator characteristics","current testing formats","sera","emerging disease","preferable tool","clinical virology","cDNA-bank","logistic regression","pathogen","patients","IgG","known infection status","purification","C-terminal domain","comparison","zoonosis","domestic livestock","obvious additional increase","microarray format","bacterial expression","BACKGROUND","systematic approach","SPSS software","CONCLUSIONS","poly","METHODS","RESULTS","Data"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Participants were asked to perform the donning and doffing of an N95 respirator to camera. Then they were randomized to a video alone or a reflective practice intervention. After the intervention they repeated the donning and doffing to camera. A critical safety behavior scoring tool (CSBST) was developed to compare the performance of the participants over time at pre-test, post-test and one month later for follow-up. RESULTS: The reflective practice intervention group was found to have significantly higher scores on the CSBST at post-test and follow-up than the video alone group. In the reflective practice intervention group, the participants perceived they were better at performing the N95 donning and doffing than the experts scored them.

Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re-infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. RESULTS: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella were abundant in the middle ear and ear canal of cases, but were uncommon in the nasopharynx of both groups. Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.

Therefore, in this study, a new type of recombinant adenovirus expressing the spike (S) protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rAd-PEDV-S, was generated, and its characteristics were determined. Then, its efficacy as a vaccine candidate was evaluated in 4-week-old pigs. The results showed that the S protein could be well expressed at a high level in rAd-PEDV-S-infected cells and that the viral titers could reach 10(11) PFU/mL. Further animal experimental results showed that rAd-PEDV-S elicited a significant PEDV-specific humoral immune response after vaccination (P \u003C 0.05). In addition, rAd-PEDV-S provided partial protection for pigs against the highly virulent PEDV challenge. The results presented in this study indicate that the adenovirus vector can be used as a vaccine delivery vector for the development of a PEDV vaccine and is a promising novel vaccine candidate for future prevention and control of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), but its efficacy still needs to be improved in the future.","publish_time":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xinsheng; Zhao, Donghong; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dd5c77b7143804f7f5c44a5d034f2518e17fff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6800969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687402/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8530273","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV vaccine","rAd-PEDV","S protein","virulent PEDV challenge","promising novel vaccine candidate","vaccine delivery vector","adenovirus vector","S-infected cells","significant PEDV-specific humoral immune response","protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","study","efficacy","recombinant adenovirus live vector-based vaccines","control of porcine epidemic diarrhea","new type of recombinant adenovirus","animal experimental results","future prevention","virus infection","week-old pigs","spike","vaccination","studies","partial protection","development","high level","viral titers","addition","recent years","characteristics","PFU"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014\u2013June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022\u20131.312; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS.

In the 19th century, antibodies from xenographic sources of polyclonal antibodies were used to treat infections (diphtheria). They were used often as protection from infectious agents and toxins. Complications related to their use involved development of immune complexes and severe allergic reactions. As a result, human source plasma for polyclonal antibodies became the preferential source for antibodies. They are used to treat infection, remove toxins, prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn, modify inflammatory reactions, and control autoimmune diseases. Continued improvements in processing decreased the transfusion/infusion transmission of infections. In the late 20th century (\u223C1986), monoclonal antibodies were developed. The first monoclonal antibodies were of xenographic source and were wrought with problems of immunogenicity. These forms of antibodies did not gain favor until chimerization took pace in the mid-1990s and in 1998 two monoclonal antibodies were approved one to treat respiratory syncytial virus and the other for breast cancers. Further development of humanized and then fully human monoclonal antibodies has led to an evolution of therapies with these agents. Monoclonal antibodies are being researched or approved to treat a multitude of diseases to include oncologic, inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, allergic, benign hematologic, infections, orthopedic, coagulopathy, metabolic and to decrease morbidity of disease (diminution of pain), modify disease progression, and potentially anatomic development. In this chapter, we will review the history of use of these passive antibody therapies, their mechanism of action, pharmacologic-therapeutic classification, particular medical indication, adverse reactions, and potential future use of these medications.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelletier, J.

Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Long-Term Care Residents with Coronavirus Respiratory Infection: A Retrospective Cohort Study","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.2126","pmcid":"PMC6810513","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory infection and institutional outbreaks, yet the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of these viruses is poorly described among the elderly residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of LTCF residents with positive nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swabs for CoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) between January 2013 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from resident charts including clinical presentation, treatment, outcome, and transmission to other residents. Variables were compared using univariate analysis. RESULTS: 3268 residents met inclusion criteria (median age 93 years, 90% male) comprising 7.5% (246/3268) of all positive respiratory virus specimens detected during the study period. 97(39%) of cases were associated with a respiratory outbreak while 149(61%) were sporadic cases that did not result in transmission. OC43 (52%) was the most commonly identified CoV and was more commonly associated with outbreak cases (76% vs. 37%; P \u003C 0.001). In total, 87% of all cases had two or more of runny nose/congestion, cough, sore throat/hoarse voice or fever. The most common symptoms among residents were cough (85%), runny nose/congestion (79%), and sore throat/hoarse voice (59%) and only 17% of residents had a measured temperature of \u2265 37.8C. Only 6% of residents received antibiotic treatment for suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.7% with 67% of deaths attributable to the CoV infection. There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms, treatment or outcomes associated with outbreaks or seasonality. CONCLUSION: CoVs make up an important proportion of respiratory viral infections among LTCF residents and may result in frequent outbreaks. Most residents remain afebrile and have self-limited illness while only a small minority develop secondary bacterial pneumonia and death. Given these findings the benefits of control measures should be weighed against the impact on resident quality of life.

To identify the types of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) causing respiratory illness in Beijing, a sentinel surveillance project on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infection was initiated in 2011. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through the surveillance project, 4617 cases of respiratory infections were identified during 2011-2013. Throat swabs (pharynx and tonsil secretions) were collected from all the patients, and 15 different respiratory viruses were screened by multiplex one-step PCR method. 45 were identified as adenovirus-positive from sporadic and outbreak cases of respiratory infection by a multiplex one-step RT-PCR method, and a total of 21 adenovirus isolates were obtained. Five HAdV types among three species, including HAdV-3 (species HAdV-B), HAdV-4 (species HAdV-E), HAdV-7 (species HAdV-B), HAdV-55 (species HAdV-B), and an undefined HAdV type (species HAdV-C) were identified. The comparison results of the penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences of the Beijing HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 strains in this study and those from the GenBank database indicated significant spatial and temporal conservation and stability of sequences within the genome; however, the phylogenetic relationship indicated that both strain BJ04 and strain BJ09 isolated in 2012 and 2013, respectively, may have recombined between HAdV-1 genome and HAdV-2 genome within species HAdV-C, indicating intraspecies recombination. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that at least 5 HAdV types including HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-55 and an undefined HAdV type were co-circulating and were the causative agents of respiratory tract infections in recent years in Beijing. HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 showed the apparent stability of the genomes, while intraspecies recombination was identified in strain BJ04 and BJ09. The recombinants carrying penton base gene of HAdV-1 as well as hexon and fiber genes of HAdV-2 might be a novel type of HAdV worthy of further study.","publish_time":"2015-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Meng; Zhu, Zhen; Huang, Fang; Liu, Donglei; Zhang, Tiegang; Ying, Deng; Wu, Jiang; Xu, Wenbo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea1a900f1243ce3264700e9eec29b402892674c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4376766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25816320/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["Beijing HAdV","HAdV types","species HAdV-B","species HAdV-C","species HAdV-E","undefined HAdV type","fiber genes of HAdV","penton base gene of HAdV","novel type of HAdV worthy","respiratory illness","cases of respiratory infections","outbreak cases of respiratory infection","different respiratory viruses","study","viral aetiology of acute respiratory infection","common causes of viral acute respiratory infections","causative agents of respiratory tract infections","strain BJ04","strain BJ09","hexon","stability of sequences","fiber gene sequences","multiplex one-step PCR method","intraspecies recombination","adenovirus-positive","adenovirus isolates","sentinel surveillance project","RT-PCR method","types of human adenoviruses","apparent stability","temporal conservation","HAdVs","co-circulating","GenBank database","recent years","Throat swabs","pharynx","tonsil secretions","genomes","total","recombinants","comparison results","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","phylogenetic relationship","patients","strains","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Asthma is a multifaceted syndrome involving atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and IgE and non-IgE-mediated acute and chronic immune responses. The asthmatic airway is characterized by an infiltrate of eosinophils and of T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Trigger factors associated with acute exacerbations of asthma include exposure to environmental allergens, especially animals, molds, pollens and mites, cold, exercise, and drugs. The frequency of exacerbations is a major factor in the quality of life of patients with COPD. The typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production, and worsened gas exchange. Although noninfectious causes of exacerbations such as allergy, air pollution, or inhaled irritants including cigarette smoke may be important, acute airway infections are the major precipitants. The infection and consequent host inflammatory response result in increased airway obstruction. The success of vaccination to prevent respiratory virus infections has been limited by significant variation within the major virus types causing disease. Currently much of the treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of increased bronchodilators, either short-acting \u03B2 2\u2014agonists in inhaled or intravenous form or anticholinergics or theophyllines, or supportive in the form of oxygen and in severe cases noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"Asthma and COPD","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b95529a1689ec87322971e9b8fbf3c3a6981d00b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149941.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute exacerbations of asthma","acute airway infections","increased airway obstruction","frequency of exacerbations","asthmatic airway","treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma","increased bronchodilators","increased dyspnea","preexisting airway pathology","major virus types","major factor","major precipitants","noninfectious causes of exacerbations","COPD","cytokines IL","respiratory virus infections","consequent host inflammatory response result","pathogen response","inhaled irritants","non-IgE","form of oxygen","intravenous form","severe cases noninvasive","epidemiological evidence","bronchial hyperreactivity","molds","animals","agonists","atopy","allergy","cigarette smoke","exposure","sputum production","environmental allergens","air pollution","significant variation","short-acting \u03B2","chapter","triggers","pollens","mites","invasive ventilatory measures","cough","multifaceted syndrome","theophyllines","anticholinergics","quality of life","infectious pathogens","T-lymphocytes","worsened gas exchange","exercise","typical clinical features","chronic immune responses","Publisher Summary","infiltrate of eosinophils","success of vaccination","mechanisms of interaction"],"language":"en"},

This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV.

In Argentina, national surveillance programs for the detection of respiratory viruses are usually performed by using immunofluorescence (IF) assays, although it is well known that molecular methods are more sensitive. An automated multiplex PCR device, the FilmArray-Respiratory Panel (FilmArray-RP), can detect 17 viral and 3 bacterial pathogens in a closed system that requires only 5 min of hands-on time and 1 h of instrumentation time. A total of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age suffering from acute respiratory infections, were studied by IF for 8 respiratory viruses and by RT-PCR for rhinoviruses. Later, these samples were tested by the FilmArray-RP. The positivity frequency obtained for the 9 viruses tested was 75 % by IF/RT-PCR and 92 % by the FilmArray-RP. The positive and negative percent agreement between both methods was 70.5 % whereas the negative percent agreement was 99.6 % (95 % confidence interval:65.5-75.1 and 99.2-99.8 respectively). The FilmArray-RP allowed a higher positive diagnosis (97 %) and detected other viruses such as coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1 (10 %) and bocavirus (18 %). In addition, this method identified multiple coinfections (39 %) with 2, 3, 4 and up to 5 different viruses. At present, IF is still the most frequently used method in most Latin American countries for respiratory viruses diagnosis due to its low cost, its capability to process a high number of samples simultaneously and the fast determination of results for the most frequent viruses, which are available within 5 h. However, the coming incorporation of molecular methods in routine procedures will significantly increase the diagnostic yield of these infections.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcone, D\u00E9bora N.; Carballal, Guadalupe; Ricarte, Carmen; Echavarria, Marcela","journal":"Rev Argent Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131815.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2014.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25735216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses diagnosis","detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory samples","frequent viruses","FilmArray-RP","different viruses","FilmArray-Respiratory Panel","Acute respiratory infections","RT-PCR","children","negative percent agreement","coming incorporation of molecular methods","higher positive diagnosis","high number of samples","automated multiplex PCR device","used method","hands-on time","h of instrumentation time","Latin American countries","years of age suffering","routine procedures","national surveillance programs","low cost","important cause of morbidity","bacterial pathogens","OC43","capability","mortality","fast determination of results","coronavirus NL63","diagnostic yield","HKU1","closed system","Argentina","addition","multiple coinfections","total","immunofluorescence","positivity frequency","rhinoviruses","confidence interval","assays","bocavirus","present"],"language":"en"},

The ability to control and regulate these processes is therefore important for analysis of infection process. Viruses are also useful tools in bio- and gene technology; they can efficiently kill cancer cells and trigger immune responses to tumors. However, the methods for constructing tissue- or cell-type specific viruses typically suffer from low target-cell specificity and a high risk of reversion. Therefore novel and universal methods of regulation of viral infection are also important for therapeutic application of virus-based systems. METHODS: Aberrantly spliced introns were introduced into crucial gene-expression units of adenovirus vector and alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vectors and their effects on the viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes were studied in cell culture. Transfection of the cells with splice-switching oligonucleotides was used to correct the introduced functional defect(s). RESULTS: It was demonstrated that viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes can be blocked by the introduction of aberrantly spliced introns. The insertion of such an intron into an adenovirus vector reduced the expression of the targeted gene more than fifty-fold. A similar insertion into an alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vector had a less dramatic effect; here, only the release of the infectious transcript was suppressed but not the subsequent replication and spread of the virus. However the insertion of two aberrantly spliced introns resulted in an over one hundred-fold reduction in the infectivity of the DNA/RNA layered vector. Furthermore, in both systems the observed effects could be reverted by the delivery of splice-switching oligonucleotide(s), which corrected the splicing defects. CONCLUSIONS: Splice-switch technology, originally developed for genetic disease therapy, can also be used to control gene expression of viral vectors. This approach represents a novel, universal and powerful method for controlling gene expression, replication, viral spread and, by extension, virus-induced cytotoxic effects and can be used both for basic studies of virus infection and in virus-based gene- and anti-cancer therapy.","publish_time":"2011-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viru, Liane; Heller, Gregory; Lehto, Taavi; P\u00E4rn, Kalle; El Andaloussi, Samir; Langel, \u00DClo; Merits, Andres","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9b2d0e930a4e8ec960b5e4dc7e627b4d243ac0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3113310.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21595942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene expression of viral vectors","virus-based gene","gene technology","viral infection","targeted gene","precise coordination of viral gene expression","crucial gene-expression units of adenovirus vector","viral spread","outcome of virus infection","basic studies of virus infection","genome replication","subsequent replication","spliced introns","RNA layered vectors","therapeutic application of virus","release of infectious genomes","alphavirus DNA","analysis of infection process","based systems","universal methods of regulation","cell culture","cancer cells","Splice-switch technology","cytotoxic effects","novel","observed effects","delivery of splice","infectious transcript","similar insertion","cell-type specific viruses","anti-cancer therapy","low target-cell specificity","fold reduction","genetic disease therapy","introduced functional defect","powerful method","bio","infectivity","extension","useful tools","high risk of reversion","immune responses","tissue","dramatic effect","processes","tumors","CONCLUSIONS","oligonucleotides","introduction","BACKGROUND","approach","Transfection","splicing defects","ability","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models\u2019 realism. Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment. Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings. Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative. These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model. Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases. This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet available.","publish_time":"2017-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prem, Kiesha; Cook, Alex R.; Jit, Mark","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3949a9e9a8c6c26ed1b9aa4bd9b02291dbeefe4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5609774.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28898249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POLYMOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact data","spread of contact","contact rates","contact networks","European countries","Asian countries","similarity of countries","location-specific contact patterns","age-specific contacts","lower-income countries","population-based contact diaries","demographic structure","proclivity of age","home","work-place contacts","estimates of mixing patterns","Epidemic models","social structure","household structure","inter-generational contacts","Household level data","transmission dynamic models of pathogens","locations","school enrolment","POLYMOD study","variations","socio-demographic factors","effect of social distancing measures","major effect","regional differences","Bayesian hierarchical model","accounting","Health Surveys","variety of metrics","workforce participation","Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation","important role","on-line databases","predictors","societies","outbreak","Heterogeneities","interventions","transmissible diseases","endemic levels","settings","models\u2019 realism"],"language":"en"},

A set of four primers\u2014two internal and two external\u2014were designed to target the H gene for the specific detection of wild-type CDV variants. The CDV-H RT-LAMP assay rapidly amplified the target gene, within 60 min, using a water bath held at a constant temperature of 65 \u00B0C. The assay was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 10(\u22121) TCID(50) ml(\u22121). The system showed a preference for wild-type CDV, and exhibited less sensitivity to canine parvovirus, canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2, canine coronavirus, and canine parainfluenza virus. The assay was validated using 102 clinical samples obtained from vaccinated dog farms, and the results were comparable to a multiplex nested RT-PCR assay.

This study examined the correlation between PLT count and respiratory virus (RV) infections. METHODS: Patients who visited Dankook University Hospital between December 2006 and February 2014 with symptoms of suspected RV infection were recruited. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions identified the causative virus(es). PLT counts were analyzed with respect to virus, age and sex of the patient, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 8,147 patients, 62.8% were RV\u2010positive, and 18.6% of RV\u2010positive patients had abnormal PLT counts. There were no differences in the rates of abnormal PLT counts between single\u2010infection and virus co\u2010infection cases. In RV infection patients, the incidence of abnormal PLT count increased with age and varied depending on the RV infection type. Patients with abnormal PLT count stayed in hospital longer than those with normal PLT count. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher among the elderly; in younger patients, thrombocytosis was more prevalent than thrombocytopenia. Respiratory tract infections caused by different viruses resulted in varied PLT count changes.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kontou, Panagiota I; Braliou, Georgia G; Dimou, Niki L; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bagos, Pantelis G","journal":"Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10050319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIA","IgG/IgM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELISA tests","LFIA tests","IgG tests","serological tests","N antigen-based tests","meta-analysis of diagnostic tests","comparison of different tests","better sensitivity","terms of sensitivity","better choice","CLIA-based methods","IgM test","lower sensitivity","individual studies","large seroprevalence studies","Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays","Fluorescence Immunoassays","IgM ones","sensitivities","combined IgG","Lateral Flow Immunoassays","S antigen","safer choice","Nucleic Acid Test","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","PubMed","bivariate method","COVID","medRxiv","systematic review","antibodies","need","gold standard","emergence of Coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","NAT","stage","bioRxiv","samples","specificities","high specificity","pandemic","data","individuals","account","antibody","infection","levels","onset of symptoms"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigated the spectrum of immune responses occurring in patients with MERS during the early period of infection. METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified. Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural proteins. RESULTS: At the acute phase of infection, elevated levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were detected in proportion to the severity of the disease. Distinctively high frequencies of MERS coronavirus\u2013reactive CD8(\u002B) T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4(\u002B) T-cell responses were minimally detected at this stage. At the convalescent phase, disease severity\u2013dependent antibody responses emerged and antigen-reactive cells were identified in both T-cell subsets. These T cells belonged to the T-helper 1 or type 1 cytotoxic T cell subtypes. While CD8(\u002B) T cells responded preferentially to the viral S protein compared with E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute stage, slightly more CD4(\u002B) T cells recognized E/M/N proteins compared with S protein at the convalescent phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show an association between the early CD8(\u002B) T-cell response and the severity of the infection, and also provide basic information that may help to prepare effective control strategies for MERS in humans.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Kim, Yeonjae; Kim, Gayeon; Lee, Ji Yeon; Jeong, Ina; Joh, Joon-Sung; Kim, Hana; Chang, Eunjin; Sim, Soo Yeon; Park, Jun-Sun; Lim, Dong-Gyun","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c9993f07fc422f47862ca90a2fafec6de452256.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108191.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["T-cell responses","T-helper","Virus-specific T cells","T-cell subsets","cytotoxic T cell subtypes","antigen-reactive cells","acute phase of infection","stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","reactive CD8","convalescent phase","N proteins","disease severity","early CD8","dependent antibody responses","understanding of immune responses","spectrum of immune responses","hospitalized patients","Plasma cytokines","CD4","early period of infection","chemokines","virus structural proteins","acute stage","high frequencies of MERS coronavirus","peripheral blood samples","viral S protein","elevated levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines","overlapping peptides","intracellular cytokine staining","Middle East respiratory syndrome","moderate illness","development of treatments","effective control strategies","humans","association","proportion","preventive measures","findings","epidemic","METHODS","BACKGROUND","antibodies","basic information","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","South Korea"],"language":"en"},

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV\u2013SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained. This survey also provided clues that silent codon changes, in particular from G-to-A, determine the subtype-specific sequence signatures.","publish_time":"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klaver, Bep; van der Velden, Yme; van Hemert, Formijn; van der Kuyl, Antoinette C.; Berkhout, Ben","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa5c3ba1a343c13446ce37073c2e03cf91032f28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5583962.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12977-017-0367-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["count","replication-competent HIV","gene segment of HIV","RNA genome","mutational impact","pol changes","new mutational approach","natural sequence variation","SIV sequence space","massive mutational approach","unknown sequence motifs","RESULTS","present","replication-impaired virus mutants","subtype-specific sequence signatures","silent codon changes","likelihood","small polymerase","biased nucleotide composition","wild-type","surplus of","clues","survey","wt","phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis","reason","reservation","fact","isolates","BACKGROUND","striking phenomenon","rich signature","hypotheses","CONCLUSIONS","variants","attempt"],"language":"en"},

Design Four hundred one of 1,278 SARS cases treated in Guangzhou China between December 2002 and June 2003 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria issued by the World Health Organization for confirmed identification of SARS. Among them, the diagnosis of critical SARS was defined by criteria of SARS guidelines incorporated with a low oxygenation index (OI) [\u003C 300 mm Hg]. Data of these patients retrieved from a database were retrospectively analyzed by logistic regression and Cox regression for the effect of corticosteroid therapy on death, hospitalization days, and complication presentation. Results Among the 401 SARS patients studied, 147 of 249 noncritical patients (59.0%) received corticosteroids (mean daily dose, 105.3 \u00B1 86.1 mg) [\u00B1 SD], and all survived the disease; 121 of 152 critical patients (79.6%) received corticosteroids at a mean daily dose of 133.5 \u00B1 102.3 mg, and 25 died. Analysis of these 401 confirmed cases did not show any benefits of corticosteroid on the death rate and hospitalization days. However, when focused on 152 critical SARS cases, factors correlated with these end points indicated by univariate analysis included use of corticosteroid, age, rigor at onset, secondary respiratory infections, pulmonary rales, grading of OI, and use of invasive ventilation. After adjustment for possible confounders, treatment with corticosteroid was shown contributing to lower overall mortality, instant mortality, and shorter hospitalization stay (p \u003C 0.05). Incidence of complications was significantly associated with the need for invasive ventilation but not with use of corticosteroids. Conclusion This Guangzhou retrospective study revealed that proper use of corticosteroid in confirmed critical SARS resulted in lowered mortality and shorter hospitalization stay, and was not associated with significant secondary lower respiratory infection and other complications.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Rong-chang; Tang, Xiao-ping; Tan, Shou-yong; Liang, Bi-ling; Wan, Zhuo-yue; Fang, Ji-qian; Zhong, Nanshan","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3d6444a660e3756cfa2ae4a72f3aa096ae1db06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094735.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215507459; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215507459","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS","Conclusion This Guangzhou"],"locations":["Guangzhou China"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","critical SARS cases","diagnosis of critical SARS","confirmed identification of SARS","proper use of corticosteroid","criteria of SARS guidelines","benefits of corticosteroid","use of corticosteroids","effect of corticosteroid therapy","hospitalization days","shorter hospitalization","confirmed cases","noncritical patients","safety profiles of corticosteroid therapy","secondary respiratory infections","instant mortality","lowered mortality","lower overall mortality","invasive ventilation","mean daily dose","significant secondary lower respiratory infection","Guangzhou retrospective study","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Cox regression","death rate","logistic regression","univariate analysis","Study objective","diagnostic criteria","Guangzhou China","Incidence of complications","onset","rigor","World Health Organization","efficacy","age","pulmonary rales","end points","factors","grading","possible confounders","treatment","low oxygenation index","complication presentation","adjustment","Conclusion","need","database","disease","Results","Design","Hg","SD"],"language":"en"},

Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected.

Both English and Chinese literature was searched and diseases were categorised according to the type of disease or transmission route. Temporal trends of morbidity and mortality rates were calculated for eight major infectious diseases types. Strong government commitment to public health responses and improvements in quality of life has led to the eradication or containment of a wide range of infectious diseases in China. The overall infectious diseases burden experienced a dramatic drop during 1975\u20131995, but since then, it reverted and maintained a gradual upward trend to date. Most notifiable diseases are contained at a low endemic level; however, local small-scale outbreaks remain common. Tuberculosis, as a bacterial infection, has re-emerged since the 1990s and has become prevalent in the country. Sexually transmitted infections are in a rapid, exponential growth phase, spreading from core groups to the general population. Together human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they account for 39% of all death cases due to infectious diseases in China in 2008. Zoonotic infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), rabies and influenza, pose constant threats to Chinese residents and remain the most deadly disease type among the infected individuals.

Such interactions may involve aggression or the transmission of infectious disease. We also assessed the effect of the use of a leash as a modifier of these outcomes. In study one, the behaviour of pet dogs being walked in popular public walking areas was observed (286 observations). Interactions with people were much rarer than interactions with dogs. Multivariable modelling suggested that percentage duration spent sniffing the ground was associated with the UK Kennel Club Breed Type, and whether the dog was observed urinating. Gundogs were observed to sniff more than other breed types. In study two, dogs (n =10) were filmed twice walking along a pre-defined route, alternately once on leash and once off leash, in order to assess the effects of leash use on interactions between the subject dog and any other dog or person encountered. Multilevel modelling suggested that if either dog was on the leash, then the likelihood of an interaction with a dog occurring was reduced. There was no evidence for statistical interactions between these variables, therefore the effect of the leash on one dog did not seem to be influenced by whether the other dog was on or off leash. We conclude that in circumstances where interactions need to be prevented, such as to reduce spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak, both dogs should be leashed.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Westgarth, Carri; Christley, Robert M.; Pinchbeck, Gina L.; Gaskell, Rosalind M.; Dawson, Susan; Bradshaw, John W.S.","journal":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55ccc66f482a831a4637e8070099436f6fccbf89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132425.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.03.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159110001036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287571/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168159110001036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multilevel"],"organizations":["UK Kennel Club Breed Type"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subject dog","dog occurring","statistical interactions","effects of leash use","behaviour of pet dogs","people","study","breed types","Multivariable modelling","Multilevel modelling","transmission of infectious disease","spread of infectious diseases","popular public walking areas","UK Kennel Club Breed Type","ground","percentage duration","aggression","variables","outbreak","sniff","evidence","modifier","likelihood","order","pre-defined route","observations","outcomes","environment","paper","person","Gundogs","circumstances","urinating"],"language":"en"},

The \u03B2-galactoside \u03B1-2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I) protein is encoded by the ST6GAL1 gene and is responsible for the addition of \u03B1-2,6 linked SA to the Gal\u03B21-4GlcNAc disaccharide of glycans and glycoproteins found on the cellular surface. Therefore, ST6GAL1 could be a potential target for anti-influenza therapeutics. We used specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to block expression of ST6GAL1 and limit distribution of SA receptors on the surface of airway epithelial cells. RESULTS: The siRNA duplexes we used inhibited ST6GAL1 mRNA expression and subsequent expression of the encoding protein. As a result, synthesis of \u03B1-2,6 SA galactose was inhibited. Adsorption of influenza virus particles to the surface of cells transfected with appropriate specific siRNAs was significantly reduced. Intracellular viral genome copy number and virus titer within the supernatant of cells transfected with siRNAs was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with those for untransfected cells and cells transfected with non-specific siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We used siRNAs targeting ST6GAL1 to inhibit the expression of certain cell surface receptors, thereby preventing virus adsorption. This resulted in the inhibition of human influenza virus infection.

However, a combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been found to be effective against SARS-CoV, and both drugs could bind well to the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)). In this work, molecular complexation between each inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and pair interaction energy analyses based on MM/PB(GB)SA and FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* methods. Both anti-HIV drugs interacted well with the residues at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). Ritonavir showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts, a somewhat higher binding efficiency, and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lopinavir, which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3CL(pro) active site. In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The interactions in terms of electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nutho, Bodee; Mahalapbutr, Panupong; Hengphasatporn, Kowit; Pattaranggoon, Nawanwat Chainuwong; Simanon, Nattapon; Shigeta, Yasuteru; Hannongbua, Supot; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada","journal":"Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6091a8b95defbd25bad60142e0e80ef2d8096885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184878.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","active site of SARS","ritonavir","drug binding","higher number of key binding residues","higher binding efficiency","repurposed anti-HIV drugs","lopinavir","COVID","higher number atomic contacts","molecular complexation","oxyanion hole residues N142","antiviral drug","protease inhibitors","free energy calculations","novel coronavirus disease","pair interaction energy analyses","all-atom molecular dynamics simulations","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","G143","dispersion","charge transfer","PB","formation","specific vaccine","important role","FMO-MP2","obtained results","PCM","terms of electrostatics","GB","emergence","interactions","China","work","hydrogen bonds","lower water accessibility","text","Wuhan","combination","methods","Image","addition"],"language":"en"},

The detection of HCoV alone (adjusted relative risk (RR) 2.18; 95% CI 1.15\u20134.15) or in co-infection with RV-C (adjusted RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.23\u20134.58) was independently associated with PICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of HCoV alone or in co-infection with RV-C was independently associated with PICU admission in young children hospitalized for ALRI.","publish_time":"2019-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuno, Alessandra K.; Gagliardi, Talita B.; Paula, Flavia E.; Luna, Luciano K.

Study design This paper reviews the sequence of events and evidence base for the decision to declare Zika a PHEIC, the global response to this, the challenges in maintaining an evidence-based approach to outbreak response and identifies learning outcomes. Methods Evidence review, all published articles in reputable UK and international journals were identified. Results The association between Zika virus infection and congenital malformations including microcephaly became a PHEIC on 1st February 2016 and was declared to be no longer an emergency in November 2016. This shaped the global response led by WHO in the first global emergency since Ebola in West Africa. Conclusion The response to Zika highlights important issues and lessons for future outbreaks that might pose an international risk. Particular challenges arose in trying to maintain an evidence-based approach to public risk communication when the evidence is unclear or still evolving. The Zika incident also demonstrates the importance of public health practitioners and agencies understanding the political context in which outbreaks must be managed and understanding the competing factors that shape the political response.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCloskey, B.; Endericks, T.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5da1eba0bbca759ebb9eabfe13495c8117eebc8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118743.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2017.05.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350617301889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651111/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350617301889","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zika","UK"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["global response","political response","evidence-based approach","Zika incident","evidence base","outbreak response","Methods Evidence","PHEIC","global emergency","international risk","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","Zika virus infection","public risk communication","international journals","future outbreaks","importance of public health practitioners","political context","Particular challenges","published articles","congenital malformations","important issues","agencies","reputable UK","microcephaly","sequence of events","lessons","decision","association","Ebola","West Africa","learning outcomes","paper","competing factors","Conclusion","Study","Abstract Objectives"],"language":"en"},

We report on our experience with a 34-year-old patient who underwent liver transplantations, with a proximal jejunostomy constructed a few days prior to the second transplantation. He was administered tacrolimus by a predominantly oral route, and less frequently received it by jejunostomy. The aim of this paper is to discuss this administration strategy and whether a different method could have been more suitable. This case report highlights that during the jejunostomy period, the tacrolimus doses that were required to maintain trough concentrations within the therapeutic range were four times higher than those administered after the closure of the jejunostomy. We observed an increase in the Dose-Normalized Trough Concentration (DNTC) values when tacrolimus was administered for 4 consecutive days by jejunostomy as compared to oral administration, indicating that the relative bioavailability of tacrolimus increased. Moreover, when returning to oral administration, the subsequent DNTC value was halved, highlighting a reduction in the tacrolimus bioavailability. Thus, in such a case, administration by jejunostomy could be more appropriate.","publish_time":"2012-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Preuss, Juliane; Gazon, Mathieu; Mabrut, Jean-Yves; Duperret, Serge; Mezoughi, Salim; Tod, Michel; Ducerf, Christian; Charpiat, Bruno","journal":"Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/048126d4fb5dd8205d6f5f5f67420c988f2b58e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104052.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2012.05.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210740112001726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22749693/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210740112001726","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["jejunostomy closure","oral administration","tacrolimus bioavailability","jejunostomy period","proximal jejunostomy","presence of jejunostomy","feasibility of oral tacrolimus administration","tacrolimus doses","relative bioavailability of tacrolimus","administration strategy","tacrolimus trough blood levels","oral route","trough concentrations","case report highlights","Dose-Normalized Trough Concentration","consecutive days","subsequent DNTC value","therapeutic range","liver transplantations","values","year-old patient","different method","studies","times higher","increase","paper","reduction","experience","aim"],"language":"en"},

As compared to healthy controls, metabolomic analyses identified significant differences in the serum metabolomes of SARS survivors. The most significant metabolic disruptions were the comprehensive increase of phosphatidylinositol and lysophospha tidylinositol levels in recovered SARS patients, which coincided with the effect of methylprednisolone administration investigated further in the steroid treated non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia. These results suggested that high-dose pulses of methylprednisolone might cause long-term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations.

Despite the strong association of GC with ON, the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Investigators have proposed both direct and indirect effects of GC on cells. Indirect and direct mechanisms remain intimately related and often result in positive feedback loops to potentiate the disease processes. However, the direct effects, in particular apoptosis, have recently been shown to be increasingly important. Suppression of osteoblast and osteoclast precursor production, increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, prolongation of the lifespan of osteoclasts and apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) are all direct effects of GC usage. Elevated blood pressure through several pathways may raise the risk of clot formation. High-dose GC also decreases tissue plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) and increases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels increasing the procoagulant potential of GC. Inhibited angiogenesis, altered bone repair and nitric oxide metabolism can also result. Also, GC treatment modulates other vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, noradrenalin and bradykinin. Thus, GCs act as a regulator of local blood flow by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances. Vasoconstriction induced in intraosseous femoral head arteries causes femoral head ischemia. GCs also cause ischemia through increased intraosseous pressure, which subsequently decreases the blood flow to the femoral head by apoptosis of ECs as well as elevating the level of adipogenesis and fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow. It is difficult to predict which patients receiving a specific dose of GC will develop ON, indicating individual differences in steroid sensitivity and the potential of additional mechanisms. The textbook model of ON is a multiple hit theory in which, with a greater number of risk factors, the risk of ON increases. While more effort is needed to better comprehend the role of GC in ON, newer data on GC action upon the endothelial cell and the regional endothelial bed dysfunction theory sheds new light on particular GC mechanisms. Better understanding of GC pathomechanisms can lead to better treatment options.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerachian, Mohammad Amin; S\u00E9guin, Chantal; Harvey, Edward J.","journal":"The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/948fb2ddb1a1541d7fe2aa9e750e2fb70e0ffdd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429441/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960076009000624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076009000624; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.02.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GC treatment","GC action","role of GC","particular GC mechanisms","indirect effects of GC","direct effects of GC usage","procoagulant potential of GC","specific dose of GC","High-dose GC","strong association of GC","Better understanding of GC pathomechanisms","direct mechanisms","femoral head ischemia","apoptosis of endothelial cells","particular apoptosis","intraosseous femoral head arteries","apoptosis of ECs","underlying mechanisms","increased apoptosis of osteoblasts","potential of additional mechanisms","increased intraosseous pressure","Elevated blood pressure","better treatment options","increases","regulator of local blood flow","risk of clot formation","tissue plasminogen activator activity","plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor","bone marrow","greater number of risk factors","vasoactive mediators","vasoactive substances","GCs act","regional endothelial bed dysfunction theory sheds new light","altered bone repair","multiple hit theory","common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis","osteoclast precursor production","t-PA","vascular responsiveness","steroid sensitivity","nitric oxide metabolism","fat hypertrophy","prolongation","osteocytes","lifespan of osteoclasts","pathways","newer data","Suppression of osteoblast","Inhibited angiogenesis","antigen levels","positive feedback loops","level of adipogenesis","endothelin","individual differences","patients","Vasoconstriction","disease processes","Abstract Glucocorticoid","textbook model","noradrenalin","bradykinin","Investigators","effort"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Antisense PMO and PPMO were designed against the 5\u2032 terminal region (5\u2032SL) or the 3\u2032-cyclization sequence region (3\u2032CS) of DENV genomic RNA and administered to AG129 mice before and/or after infection with DENV-2. In addition, cell culture evaluations designed to determine optimum PPMO length, and pharmacokinetic and toxicity analysis of PPMO were also carried out. RESULTS: Mock-treated AG129 mice lived for 9\u201317 days following intraperitoneal (ip) infection with 10(4)\u201310(6)pfu of DENV-2 (strain New Guinea C). Intraperitoneal administration of 5\u2032SL or 3\u2032CS PPMO before and after DENV infection produced an increase in the average survival time of up to 8 days. Animals receiving only post-infection PPMO treatment did not benefit significantly. Cell culture studies showed that PPMO of 22\u201324 bases long produced substantially higher DENV titre reductions than did PPMO that were either shorter or longer. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology analysis with non-infected animals showed that nine consecutive once\u2010daily ip treatments of 10 mg/kg PPMO resulted in high concentrations of PPMO in the liver and caused little impact on overall health. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that PPMO had considerable antiviral efficacy against DENV-2 in the AG129 mouse model and that PPMO treatment early in the course of an infection was critical to extending the survival times of DENV-2-infected mice in the AG129 model system.","publish_time":"2008-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, David A.; Huang, Claire Y.-H.; Silengo, Shawn; Amantana, Adams; Crumley, Stacy; Blouch, Robert E.; Iversen, Patrick L.; Kinney, Richard M.","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a87ae49de8d7bd0added2594ed04b21a39aec7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109848.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkn221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18567576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMO","Antisense PMO","PPMO","DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CS PPMO","DENV infection","toxicity analysis of PPMO","post-infection PPMO treatment","optimum PPMO length","high concentrations of PPMO","pfu of DENV","survival times of DENV","infected mice","DENV genomic RNA","Mock-treated AG129 mice","higher DENV titre reductions","AG129 mouse model","AG129 model system","Antisense PMO","non-infected animals","SL","days","peptide-conjugated PMO","cell culture evaluations","Cell culture studies","toxicology analysis","terminal region","Intraperitoneal administration","considerable antiviral efficacy","average survival time","daily ip treatments","cyclization sequence region","antiviral activity of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers","liver","increase","little impact","data","RESULTS","bases","course","dengue","virus","overall health","addition","METHODS","New Guinea C","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we introduce a new microfluidic method for detection of various viruses using rolling circle amplification (RCA) of pathogens on the surface of thousands of microbeads packed in microchannels. When a targeted pathogen meets the corresponding particular template, the DNAs are rapidly amplified into a specific dumbbell shape through the RCA process, forming a DNA hydrogel and blocking the flow path formed between the beads.

The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. 2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. 3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician\u2013patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

A HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of this acute outbreak of febrile respiratory illness based on clinical manifestations, epidemiological characteristics, specific molecular detection results, phylogenetic analysis, and serological assays. The virus was isolated by the rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture method, and the complete sequences of the E1A, penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were determined and deposited in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses indicated that the isolated strain is most closely related to some HAdV-55 strains from mainland China. However, this strain appeared to be less virulent than former HAdV-55 strains. According to the chest X-ray results of 31 affected patients, there was no radiological evidence of pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms in these patients were sore throat (95.12 %, 156/164) and tonsillitis (93.29 %, 153/164). During the course of the outbreak, incorrect response measures and some potential risk factors, such as fire training and marching training, may have exacerbated the spread of the infection. This outbreak illustrates the urgent need to improve the epidemiological and etiological surveillance of HAdV infections and to improve the ability of doctors and health officials in basic units of the Chinese army to respond effectively to febrile respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2016-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dongliu, Yuan; Guoliang, Yang; Haocheng, Xu; Shuaijia, Qing; Li, Bing; Yanglei, Jia","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75bf710f6122644a9cbb713cf9b68f0dce00d832.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27352268/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2949-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of acute febrile respiratory illness","acute outbreak of febrile respiratory illness","HAdV-B","affected patients","military training center","P14H11F14","military personnel","etiological surveillance of HAdV infections","marching training","strains","isolated strain","epidemiological characteristics","phylogenetic analysis","military regional central hospital","etiological pathogen","mainland China","human adenovirus B","chest X-ray results","specific molecular detection results","clinical manifestations","incorrect response measures","penton base","complete sequences","basic units","intensive care unit","health officials","potential risk factors","hexon","E1A","ability of doctors","Chinese army","rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture method","sequence homology analyses","fiber genes","frequent symptoms","sore throat","serological assays","urgent need","radiological evidence of pneumonia","course","study","spread","total","GenBank database","tonsillitis"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus genomes encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316), which assemble into a large replication\u2013transcription complex mediating virus propagation. Nonstructural protein 9, which binds to the single-stranded DNA/RNA, has been shown to be indispensible for viral replication. Interestingly, a functional mutant (N60K) of nsp9 was identified to compensate for a 6 nt insertion mutation of the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), which is critical for viral RNA synthesis. It has been proposed that the N60K mutation may cause certain conformational changes of nsp9 to rescue the defective insertion mutant.

Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral infection while also largely preserving tissue integrity, are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology, while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, which is termed as \u0022immunosenescence\u0022. We show that aged mice (16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV infection result in faster clearance of virus, but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice, the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage, and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics, displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV infection. Hence, our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance, might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens.

Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Peichao; Zhang, Hong; Wu, Zhiwei; Wang, Jicheng","journal":"Environ Plan A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a402d69bca02c261a776a6ed65ba5668fec763a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140974.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518x20910162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","public access","public communications","better public participation","disease data","public-health decision making","circular cartograms","employing cartograms","Coronavirus disease","choropleth map","data of confirmed cases","critical factor","international organisations","transparency","growing focus of global attention","various actions","maps","outbreak","countries","fight","important role","temporal information","design","hours","expansion","combination","words"],"language":"en"},

A common point in many of past studies is, however, that there is only one peak of infected density in each single epidemic spreading episode. At variance, real data from different cities over the world suggest that, besides a major single peak trait of infected density, a finite probability exists for a pattern made of two (or multiple) peaks. We show that such a latter feature is distinctive of a multilayered network of interactions, and reveal that a two peaks pattern may emerge from different time delays at which the epidemic spreads in between the two layers. Further, we show that the essential ingredient is a weak coupling condition between the layers themselves, while different degree distributions in the two layers are also helpful. Moreover, an edge-based theory is developed which fully explains all numerical results. Our findings may therefore be of significance for protecting secondary disasters of epidemics, which are definitely undesired in real life.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Muhua; Wang, Wei; Tang, Ming; Zhou, Jie; Boccaletti, S.; Liu, Zonghua","journal":"Chaos, Solitons \u0026 Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0626e0a0e99ed2f9c651fceebf73785b6ee3c6c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/644af61fa3cb6cf569a010dab647880d1522b255.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126231.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077917305349; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05780v2.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077917305349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["layers","single epidemic","peak of infected density","different cities","epidemic spreads","study of epidemic spreading","peaks pattern","major single peak trait of infected density","different time delays","different degree distributions","real data","real life","populations of networked individuals","weak coupling condition","finite probability","significance","essential ingredient","world","variance","great deal of significant progresses","multilayered network of interactions","secondary disasters of epidemics","common point","past studies","feature","episode","edge-based theory","numerical results","findings"],"language":"en"},

A \u2018pat7\u2019 motif of 41-PGKK(N/S)KK has previously been identified in the N protein as the functional nuclear localization signal (NLS); however, the biological consequences of N protein nuclear localization are unknown. In the present study, the role of N protein nuclear localization during infection was investigated in pigs using an NLS-null mutant virus. When two lysines at 43 and 44 at the NLS locus were substituted to glycines, the modified NLS with 41-PGGGNKK restricted the N protein to the cytoplasm. This NLS-null mutation was introduced into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV. Upon transfection of cells, the NLS-null full-length clone induced cytopathic effects and produced infectious progeny. The NLS-null virus grew to a titer 100-fold lower than that of wild-type virus. To examine the response to NLS-null PRRSV in the natural host, three groups of pigs, consisting of seven animals per group, were intranasally inoculated with wild-type, placebo, or NLS-null virus, and the animals were maintained for 4 weeks. The NLS-null-infected pigs had a significantly shorter mean duration of viremia than wild-type-infected pigs but developed significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Mutations occurred at the NLS locus in one pig during viremia, and four types of mutations were identified: 41-PGRGNKK, 41-PGGRNKK, and 41-PGRRNKK, and 41-PGKKSKK. Both wild-type and NLS-null viruses persisted in the tonsils for at least 4 weeks, and the NLS-null virus persisting in the tonsils was found to be mutated to either 41-PGRGNKK or 41-PGGRNKK in all pigs. No other mutation was found in the N gene. All types of reversions which occurred during viremia and persistence were able to translocate the mutated N proteins to the nucleus, indicating a strong selection pressure for reversion at the NLS locus of the N protein in vivo. Reversions from NLS-null to functional NLS in the tonsils suggest a possible correlation of viral persistence with N protein nuclear localization. These results show that N protein nuclear localization is non-essential for PRRSV multiplication but may play an important role in viral attenuation and in pathogenesis in vivo.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Changhee; Hodgins, Douglas; Calvert, Jay G.; Welch, Siao-Kun W.; Jolie, Rika; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7eb3271edf4fcf06bf7e90037352aca7c2c26ea2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172752.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205007464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["N/S)KK","NLS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NLS-null PRRSV","NLS locus","NLS-null mutation","functional NLS","NLS-null viruses","NLS-null mutant virus","modified NLS","NLS-null full-length clone","role of N protein nuclear localization","N gene","wild-type virus","biological consequences of N protein nuclear localization","mutated N proteins","RNA virus","virus-infected cells","infected pigs","respiratory syndrome virus","functional nuclear localization signal","groups of pigs","tonsils","PRRSV multiplication","full-length infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV","nucleus","cytoplasm","types of reversions","types of mutations","animals","PGGRNKK","weeks","PGRGNKK","possible correlation of viral persistence","shorter mean duration of viremia","important role","viral attenuation","infectious progeny","transfection of cells","cytopathic effects","natural host","strong selection pressure","infection","placebo","higher titers of neutralizing antibodies","nucleolus","glycines","PGGGNKK","results","present study","pathogenesis","motif","nucleocapsid","response","pat7","PGRRNKK","PGKKSKK","lysines"],"language":"en"},

While thermal effects in ecologically important groups such as daphnids have been intensively studied at the ecosystem level and at least partly at the organismic level, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the acclimation to different temperatures. By using 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the present study identified the major elements of the temperature-induced subset of the proteome from differently acclimated Daphnia pulex. RESULTS: Specific sets of proteins were found to be differentially expressed in 10\u00B0C or 20\u00B0C acclimated D. pulex. Most cold-repressed proteins comprised secretory enzymes which are involved in protein digestion (trypsins, chymotrypsins, astacin, carboxypeptidases). The cold-induced sets of proteins included several vitellogenin and actin isoforms (cytoplasmic and muscle-specific), and an AAA\u002B ATPase. Carbohydrate-modifying enzymes were constitutively expressed or down-regulated in the cold. CONCLUSION: Specific sets of cold-repressed and cold-induced proteins in D. pulex can be related to changes in the cellular demand for amino acids or to the compensatory control of physiological processes. The increase of proteolytic enzyme concentration and the decrease of vitellogenin, actin and total protein concentration between 10\u00B0C and 20\u00B0C acclimated animals reflect the increased amino-acids demand and the reduced protein reserves in the animal\u0027s body. Conversely, the increase of actin concentration in cold-acclimated animals may contribute to a compensatory mechanism which ensures the relative constancy of muscular performance. The sheer number of peptidase genes (serine-peptidase-like: \u003E 200, astacin-like: 36, carboxypeptidase-like: 30) in the D. pulex genome suggests large-scaled gene family expansions that might reflect specific adaptations to the lifestyle of a planktonic filter feeder in a highly variable aquatic environment.","publish_time":"2009-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwerin, Susanne; Zeis, Bettina; Lamkemeyer, Tobias; Paul, R\u00FCdiger J; Koch, Marita; Madlung, Johannes; Fladerer, Claudia; Pirow, Ralph","journal":"BMC Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61f7459a82d39c89e72c2c8068dbb87f7652dba9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2678069.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6793-9-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19383147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D. pulex"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cold-acclimated animals","cold-induced proteins","Specific sets of cold","cold-induced sets of proteins","C acclimated animals","Specific sets of proteins","acclimated Daphnia pulex","repressed proteins","increase of actin concentration","specific adaptations","muscle-specific","pulex genome","total protein concentration","amino acids","protein digestion","actin isoforms","temperature-induced subset","astacin","increased amino-acids demand","increase of proteolytic enzyme concentration","reduced protein reserves","biology of poikilothermic animals","decrease of vitellogenin","mass spectrometry","mass budgets","compensatory mechanism","cellular demand","serine-peptidase","secretory enzymes","organismic level","ecosystem level","sheer number of peptidase genes","compensatory control of physiological processes","large-scaled gene family expansions","energy","proteome","present study","major elements","planktonic filter feeder","activity","lifestyle","chymotrypsins","aspect","D gel electrophoresis","important groups","acclimation","variable aquatic environment","relative constancy of muscular performance","growth","animal\u0027s body","changes","molecular mechanisms","different temperatures","thermal effects","carboxypeptidases","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","daphnids","reproduction","BACKGROUND","AAA","ATPase","Carbohydrate"],"language":"en"},

Live attenuated VZV vaccines are available; however, they can also establish latent infections and reactivate. Studies of VZV latency have been limited to the analyses of human ganglia removed at autopsy, as the virus is strictly a human pathogen. Recently, terminally differentiated human neurons have received much attention as a means to study the interaction between VZV and human neurons; however, the short life-span of these cells in culture has limited their application. Herein, we describe the construction of a model of normal human neural progenitor cells (NHNP) in tissue-like assemblies (TLAs), which can be successfully maintained for at least 180 days in three-dimensional (3D) culture, and exhibit an expression profile similar to that of human trigeminal ganglia. Infection of NHNP TLAs with cell-free VZV resulted in a persistent infection that was maintained for three months, during which the virus genome remained stable. Immediate-early, early and late VZV genes were transcribed, and low-levels of infectious VZV were recurrently detected in the culture supernatant. Our data suggest that NHNP TLAs are an effective system to investigate long-term interactions of VZV with complex assemblies of human neuronal cells.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodwin, Thomas J.; McCarthy, Maureen; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Cohrs, Randall J.; Kaufer, Benedikt B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/492ae848b7e2b20047ac406af1c7712ea6255461.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3731237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23935496/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003512","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VZV","NHNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human neurons","infectious VZV","human pathogen","Studies of VZV latency","human trigeminal ganglia","analyses of human ganglia","long-term interactions of VZV","cell-free VZV","late VZV genes","neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus","complex assemblies of human neuronal cells","Infection of NHNP TLAs","Live attenuated VZV vaccines","model of normal human neural progenitor cells","Varicella-zoster virus","primary infection","persistent infection","virus genome","culture supernatant","multiple ganglionic neurons","Immediate-early","effective system","tissue","expression profile similar","short life-span","low-levels","autopsy","means","construction","months","attention","days","application","data","latent infections"],"language":"en"},

To elucidate the determinants that enable the P450s to be located in the ER, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins in which a secretory form of carboxyesterase, carboxyesterase Sec, was connected to the N-terminus of the full-length or truncated forms of a microsomal-type P450, P45O(M1), and the constructed plasmids were expressed in COS cells. Since carboxyesterase Sec is an iV-glycosylated secretory protein, endo H treatment could be used to determine whether these chimeric proteins were located in the ER or not. Carboxyesterase Sec with the N-terminal 20 amino acids, containing the transmembrane region, of P46O(M1), was located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity of the expressed protein and immunofluorescence staining of the cells. As the expressed protein exhibited carboxyesterase activity, it was not retained in the ER through the BiP-dependent quality control system recognizing unfolded proteins. Another chimeric protein construct in which carboxyesterase Sec was connected to the C-terminal region of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), that contained a double-lysin ER retention motif, was also located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity and immunofluorescence staining. On the other hand, the sugar moiety of the carboxyesterase Sec connected to the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT, Sec/GTd, was partially resistant to the endo H treatment. From the results of immunofluorescent staining and cell fractiona-tion, it was concluded that the Sec/GTd product was located in the Golgi apparatus. These observations indicated that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment of P45O(M1) is sufficient for the ER membrane retention, whereas the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT is not. To determine whether microsomal P450s are recycled between the ER and Golgi compartments or not, a DNA construct encoding cathepsin D connected to the N-terminus of P45O(M1) was prepared and expressed in COS cells. The fusion protein was phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. As a control, authentic cathepsin D was subjected to phosphorylation of its oligosaccharide chain that was resistant to the alkaline phosphatase treatment. Since GlcNAc-P-transferase, which forms the alkaline phosphatase-resistant phosphodiester in the sugar chains of lysosome-targeting proteins, is located in the Golgi apparatus, it was concluded that the oligosaccharide chain of the cathepsin D portion of the fusion protein was not phosphorylated, and that the chimeric protein did not go to the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that P45O(M1) is not recycled from the Golgi compartments to the ER in cells.","publish_time":"1994-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murakami, Kazuya; Mihara, Katsuyosi; Omura, Tsuneo","journal":"J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sec","COS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["carboxyesterase Sec","expressed protein","M1","ER membrane retention","chimeric proteins","fusion protein","chimeric protein construct","transmembrane segment of UDP","carboxyesterase activity","Golgi apparatus","N-terminal transmembrane hydrophobic segment","N-terminal hydrophobic segment of P45O","endo H treatment","UDP-GT","N-terminus","Golgi compartments","secretory form of carboxyesterase","endo H sensitivity","transmembrane region","integral membrane proteins","unfolded proteins","microsomal P450s","alkaline phosphatase treatment","COS cells","double-lysin ER retention motif","iV-glycosylated secretory protein","immunofluorescence staining","alkaline phosphatase-resistant phosphodiester","cathepsin D portion","authentic cathepsin D","Microsomal-type cytochrome P450s","C-terminal region of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase","microsomal-type P450","phosphorylation","results of immunofluorescent staining","oligosaccharide chain","sugar moiety","DNA construct","truncated forms","GTd product","constructed plasmids","sugar chains of lysosome","BiP-dependent quality control system","signal anchor sequence","amino acids","cell fractiona-tion","P46O","cDNAs","GlcNAc-P","hand","observations","determinants"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease. No information is currently available on host-specific immunity against the SARS coronavirus (CoV), and detailed characteristics of the epidemiology of SARS CoV infection have not been identified. Methods. ELISA was used to detect antibody to SARS CoV. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SARS CoV RNA. T cells in peripheral blood of patients were quantified by flow cytometry. Results. Of 36 patients with probable SARS CoV infection, 30 (83.3%) were positive for IgG antibody to SARS CoV; in contrast, only 3 of 48 patients with suspected SARS CoV infection, 0 of 112 patients with fever but without SARS, and 0 of 96 healthy control individuals were positive for it. IgG antibody to SARS CoV was first detected between day 5 and day 47 after onset of illness (mean \u00B1 SD, 18.7\u00B110.4). Conclusion. Detection of antibody to SARS CoV is useful in the diagnosis of SARS; however, at the incubation and initial phases of the illness, serological assay is of little value, because of late seroconversion in most patients.","publish_time":"2004-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xinchun; Zhou, Boping; Li, Meizhong; Liang, Xiaorong; Wang, Huosheng; Yang, Guilin; Wang, Hui; Le, Xiaohua","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94f836719ff841687a85c54436ad3edcbce17b8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzIxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ELISA"],"organizations":["SARS","SARS CoV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS CoV RNA","SARS coronavirus","diagnosis of SARS","epidemiology of SARS CoV infection","probable SARS CoV infection","suspected SARS CoV infection","IgG antibody","Detection of antibody","peripheral blood of patients","day","onset of illness","little value","serological assay","host-specific immunity","detailed characteristics","Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","initial phases","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","T cells","late seroconversion","incubation","contrast","healthy control individuals","novel infectious disease","mean","SD","flow cytometry","information","fever","ELISA","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.","publish_time":"2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallinga, Jacco; Teunis, Peter","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c06b521d3cc694ef2e3ada44041cf020e4f2927.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110200.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzIxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Canada"],"keyphrases":["similar control measures","epidemic size","controlling SARS outbreaks","available epidemic curves","expected epidemic duration","observed epidemic curve","institution of control measures","temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers","various affected regions","similar disease transmission potentials","similar levels of effectiveness","severe contagious disease","likelihood-based estimation procedure","available data","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","marked differences","respect","total number of cases","epidemics","Hong Kong","timely alerts","Vietnam","Singapore","Precise estimates","authors","weeks","Canada","century"],"language":"en"},

Surveying such phenomena helps to understand how nurses feel and behave when cancer care is provided. Besides, tracking the evolving nature of those three concepts can lend a hand for the early detection of personal and professional suffering of nurses while offering some healing remedies to their struggling bodies and souls. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the level of compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a group of specialized oncology nurses. Besides, this study aimed to detect some probable interesting inferences between compassion satisfaction and the concept of rest and leisure. Correlations between compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction were investigated. Correlations between oncology nurses\u2019 scores on the three subscales and a group of demographic, organizational and leisure-related variables were examined. METHODS: This study adopted a descriptive correlation design to survey compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a convenient sample of 100 oncology nurses who work in a specialized cancer care centre. Participants completed compassion fatigue self-test developed by Figely (Compassion fatigue, New York: Brunner/Mazel. B. HudnallStamm, Traumatic Stress Research Group; 1995\u20131998. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bhstamm/index.htm, 1995) and a literature-based demographic survey. Analysis of data included descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation co-efficient. RESULTS: Nurses reported a low level of compassion satisfaction, moderate risk for burn out and an extremely high risk for compassion fatigue. Results revealed significant negative relationships among compassion satisfaction and the number of dependents per nurse. Additionally the correlation between compassion satisfaction and the nurses\u2019 number of hours slept was positive. Only two components of the concept rest and leisure yielded statistical significance when correlated to the concept of compassion satisfaction. A significant negative relationship was observed between compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue while a strong positive relationship was observed between compassion fatigue and burn out. CONCLUSIONS: The studied oncology nurses sample had evidently low level of compassion satisfaction when contrasted to the significantly increased risks of burn out and compassion fatigue. Thus, health authorities and management are advised to care, in a holistic approach, for nurses who work in oncology departments. Staff-oriented services that offer comfort, reward, leisure, screening, consultation and support are urgently recommended.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarrad, Reem Ahmad; Hammad, Sawsan","journal":"Ann Gen Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eede67e5271600204a32717b585731e502eda1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzMwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Traumatic Stress Research Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level of compassion fatigue","concept of compassion satisfaction","compassion satisfactions","low level of compassion satisfaction","compassion fatigue self-test","group of specialized oncology nurses","studied oncology nurses sample","oncology departments","oncology work environment","professional suffering of nurses","oncology nurses\u2019 scores","study","concept of rest","concept rest","group of demographic","descriptive correlation design","leisure-related variables","RESULTS","specialized cancer care centre","Correlations","demographic survey","PURPOSE","strong positive relationship","nurses\u2019 number of hours","significant negative relationships","descriptive statistics","convenient sample","Pearson correlation co-efficient","number of dependents","Traumatic Stress Research Group","moderate risk","high risk","Figely","experienced psychosocial consequences","comfort","reward","New York","early detection of personal","screening","healing remedies","statistical significance","subscales","Brunner","probable interesting inferences","struggling bodies","hand","HudnallStamm","Analysis of data","consultation","Participants","CONCLUSIONS","Staff-oriented services","concepts","souls","Mazel","support","components","increased risks","BACKGROUND","health authorities","management","evolving nature","literature","METHODS","holistic approach","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2013-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fajardo, David; Gardner, Lauren M.","journal":"Netw Spat Econ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9172b1b4657b544d5960b47fbf340876713ff8d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzMzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection pattern","likely paths of infection","susceptible individuals","available infection data","contacts","heuristic solution methods","social-contact network","prediction methods","ongoing outbreak","contagion process","stochastic process","heuristic performance","model results","spread of infectious disease","future epidemic outbreak patterns","aid","bi-linear integer program","generated networks","range","current state","assumption","different levels of information","real time control","insight","nodes","significant challenge","development of intervention strategies","diseases","direct human interaction","paper","sub-problems","links"],"language":"en"},

Infections may also promote airway inflammation and enhance T helper type 2 lymphocyte (Th2 cell) responses that result in exacerbations of established asthma. The mechanisms of how RSV and RV induce and exacerbate asthma are currently being elucidated by clinical studies, in vitro work with human cells and animal models of disease.

The impact of Hurricane Sandy on New York City area hospitals provided a unique opportunity to learn from the experience of ICU providers about their preparedness, perspective, roles, and activities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who played direct roles during the Hurricane Sandy ICU evacuations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight health care professionals from 4 evacuating hospitals completed surveys (35% ICU nurses, 21% respiratory therapists, 25% physicians-in-training, and 13% attending physicians). Only 21% had participated in an ICU evacuation drill in the past 2 years and 28% had prior training or real-life experience. Processes were inconsistent for patient prioritization, tracking, transport medications, and transport care. Respondents identified communication (43%) as the key barrier to effective evacuation. The equipment considered most helpful included flashlights (24%), transport sleds (21%), and oxygen tanks and respiratory therapy supplies (19%). An evacuation wish list included walkie-talkies/phones (26%), lighting/electricity (18%), flashlights (10%), and portable ventilators and suction (16%). CONCLUSIONS: ICU providers who evacuated critically ill patients during Hurricane Sandy had little prior knowledge of evacuation processes or vertical evacuation experience. The weakest links in the patient evacuation process were communication and the availability of practical tools. Incorporating ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training, developing standard evacuation communication processes and tools, and collecting a uniform dataset among all evacuating hospitals could better inform critical care evacuation in the future.

The low yields of cell-based manufacturing systems using egg-derived CVVs remain an unsolved issue. This study aimed to develop high-growth cell-derived CVVs for MDCK cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms. METHODS: Four H7N9 CVVs were generated in characterized Vero and adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells. Furthermore, reassortant viruses were amplified in adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells with certification, and their growth characteristics were detected in aMDCK cells and new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells. Finally, the plaque-forming ability, biosafety, and immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses were evaluated. RESULTS: The HA titers of these CVVs produced in proprietary suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells and chicken embryos were 2- to 8-fold higher than those in aMDCK cells. All H7N9 CVVs showed attenuated characteristics by trypsin-dependent plaque assay and chicken embryo lethality test. The alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5 (derived from the fifth wave H7N9 virus A/Guangdong/SP440/2017) vaccine had the highest immunogenicity and cross-reactivity among the four H7N9 CVVs. Finally, we found that AddaVax adjuvant improved the cross-reactivity of low pathogenic H7N9 virus against highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that cell-derived H7N9 CVVs possessed high growth rate in new sMDCK cells and low pathogenicity in chicken embryo, and that CVVs generated by this platform are also suitable for both cell- and egg-based prepandemic vaccine production.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tzeng, Tsai-Teng; Chen, Po-Ling; Weng, Tsai-Chuan; Tsai, Shin-Yi; Lai, Chia-Chun; Chou, Hsin-I; Chen, Pin-Wen; Lu, Chia-Chun; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Sung, Wang-Chou; Lee, Min-Shi; Hu, Alan Yung-Chih","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13173ec2d584121d2419ad008e5cd6d04f76912a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-derived H7N9 CVVs","egg-derived CVVs","aMDCK cells","high-growth cell-derived CVVs","pathogenic H7N9 viruses","mammalian cells","new sMDCK cells","immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses","egg-derived candidate vaccine viruses","low pathogenic H7N9 virus","wave H7N9 virus","adherent MDCK","MDCK cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms","new suspension MDCK","low yields of cell","egg-based prepandemic vaccine production","high-yield influenza viruses","proprietary suspension MDCK","Influenza vaccine manufacturers","growth characteristics","high growth rate","based manufacturing systems","cross-reactivity","low pathogenicity","chicken embryos","study","chicken embryo lethality test","attenuated characteristics","highest immunogenicity","trypsin-dependent plaque assay","characterized Vero","pandemic vaccines","biosafety","Guangdong","certification","adaptation process","SP440","HA titers","alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5","unsolved issue","ability","AddaVax adjuvant","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Cross-reactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens.

Necrotizing pneumonia is usually associated with severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Adequate antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, pleural drainage, and prolonged supportive care are mandatory. Adult patients with necrotizing pneumonia may require surgery. In our practice, indications for surgery are: (1) uncontrolled sepsis in spite of medical therapy and chest drainage; (2) major air leaks responsible for ventilation difficulties with serious hypoxemia/hypercapnia; and (3) hemodynamic disturbances by compression of vena cava and/or right heart cavities by tumor-like forms. Surgical treatment should be adapted to each case.

In 2011, a consensus-based template documenting and reporting data in p-EMS was published. We aimed to revise and update the template for documenting and reporting in p-EMS. METHODS: A Delphi method was applied to achieve a consensus from a panel of selected European experts. The experts were blinded to each other until a consensus was reached, and all responses were anonymized. The experts were asked to propose variables within five predefined sections. There was also an optional sixth section for variables that did not fit into the pre-defined sections. Experts were asked to review and rate all variables from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) based on relevance, and consensus was defined as variables rated \u22654 by more than 70% of the experts. RESULTS: Eleven experts participated. The experts generated 194 unique variables in the first round. After five rounds, a consensus was reached. The updated dataset was an expanded version of the original dataset and the template was expanded from 45 to 73 main variables. The experts approved the final version of the template.

The results of the study show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a viral infection involving the brain.","publish_time":"2002-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liebert, Uwe G.; ter Meulen, Volker","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["MV","MBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MBP-peptides","non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive","viral infection","MV-infected Lewis rats","autoimmune based disease process","cellular autoimmune reactions","experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","induced CMAI","animal model of measles virus","subacute measles encephalitis","myelin basic protein","normal central nervous tissue","occurrence","different combinations of antibodies","residues","EAE","pathology","structural proteins","humoral immune responses","treatment combination","animals","components","questions","study","attempt","results","antigen","brain"],"language":"en"},

Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oldham, G.; Bridger, J.C.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary rotavirus infection","secondary rotavirus infection","primary infection","Rotavirus-naive","DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves","Treatment of calves","rotavirus-immune gnotobiotic calves","secondary infection","challenge infection","virulent rotavirus inoculum","systemic antibody responses","mitogen responses","local antibody responses","effect of DX treatment","start of DX treatment","role of immune responses","local specific antibody responses","antibody levels","immune mechanisms","immune system","virulent virus","resistance","ability of parenteral treatment","mitogen responsiveness","virus excretion","evidence","responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes","mitogens","recovery","high doses of dexamethasone","functional cell","greater clinical signs","relation","Suppression","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P \u003C 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22\u201332 and 38\u201342 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P \u003C 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17\u201323 and 26\u201338 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.","publish_time":"2000-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dr\u00E9au, D.; Lall\u00E8s, J.P.; Salmon, H.; Toullec, R.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SMP","HSF","HSPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigenic HSF","groups of calves","HSF antigens","Specific IgM","HSF extracts","soyabean proteins","IgG1 titres","soya proteins","IgA isotypes","IgA titres","IgG1 immunoblotting","month-old calves","soyabean immunogenicity","Immunorecognition of specific proteins","SMP","protein bands","present specific Abs","HSPI diet","Specific antibodies","IgG2 Abs","immunogenicity of soyabean products","jejunal mucous secretion of calves","low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate","protein basis","dietary proteins","lesser extent HSPI","antigenic heated soya flour","plasma","animal groups","contrast","kDa","intestinal mucous secretions","main isotypes","experimental diets","weak bands","similar patterns","molecular range","months liquid diets","skim milk powder","blot-immunobinding","whey","severe gastrointestinal disorders","dot","particular Ig subclasses","mixture","nitrocellulose sheets","antibody responses","control","fold increase","adequate proteolysis","immunostaining of samples"],"language":"en"},

The standard GWAS analysis examines SNPs/genes independently and identifies only a number of the most significant SNPs. It ignores the combined effect of weaker SNPs/genes, which leads to difficulties to explore biological function and mechanism from a systems point of view. Although gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has been introduced to GWAS to overcome these limitations by identifying the correlation between pathways/gene sets and traits, the heavy dependence on genotype data, which is not easily available for most published GWAS investigations, has led to limited application of it. In order to perform GSEA on a simple list of GWAS SNP P-values, we implemented GSEA by using SNP label permutation. We further improved GSEA (i-GSEA) by focusing on pathways/gene sets with high proportion of significant genes. To provide researchers an open platform to analyze GWAS data, we developed the i-GSEA4GWAS (improved GSEA for GWAS) web server. i-GSEA4GWAS implements the i-GSEA approach and aims to provide new insights in complex disease studies. i-GSEA4GWAS is freely available at http://gsea4gwas.psych.ac.cn/.","publish_time":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Kunlin; Cui, Sijia; Chang, Suhua; Zhang, Liuyan; Wang, Jing","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e40cb7055fe5ef148eced8994ff059a0e98aef1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2896119.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20435672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GWAS","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GWAS data","improved GSEA","i-GSEA approach","i-GSEA4GWAS","standard GWAS analysis","published GWAS investigations","gene sets","significant SNPs","simple list of GWAS SNP P-values","pathways","high proportion of significant genes","gene set enrichment analysis","complex disease studies","human complex disease","genotype data","combined effect of weaker SNPs","SNP label permutation","traits","heavy dependence","new insights","mechanism","systems","biological function","difficulties","Genome-wide association study","open platform","correlation","web server","researchers","limitations","number","limited application","view","order"],"language":"en"},

The MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has spread in the Middle East, but cases originating in the Middle East have also occurred in the European Union and the USA. Eight hundred and thirty-seven cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed to date, including 291 deaths. MERS-CoV has infected dromedary camel populations in the Middle East at high rates, representing an immediate source of human infection. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered as a key target of vaccines against coronavirus infection. In an initial attempt to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine to ultimately target dromedary camels, we constructed two recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding the full-length MERS-CoV S protein (Ad5.MERS-S) and the S1 extracellular domain of S protein (Ad5.MERS-S1). BALB/c mice were immunized with both candidate vaccines intramuscularly and boosted three weeks later intranasally. All the vaccinated animals had antibody responses against spike protein, which neutralized MERS-CoV in vitro. These results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce MERS-CoV-specific immune responses in mice and hold promise for the development of a preventive vaccine that targets the animal reservoir, which might be an effective measure to eliminate transmission of MERS-CoV to humans.","publish_time":"2014-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eun; Okada, Kaori; Kenniston, Tom; Raj, V.

We identified MERS-related tweets with keywords such as \u2018MERS\u2019 and its translation in five different languages. We translated non-English tweets into English for statistical comparison. RESULTS: We retrieved MERS-related Twitter data in five languages: Korean (N = 21,823), English (N = 4024), Thai (N = 2084), Japanese (N = 1334) and Indonesian (N = 1256). Categories of randomly selected user profiles (p \u003C 0.001) and the top 30 sources of retweets (p \u003C 0.001) differed between the five language corpora. Among the randomly selected user profiles, K-pop fans ranged from 4% in the Korean corpus to 70% in the Thai corpus; media ranged from 0% (Thai) to 14% (Indonesian); political advocates ranged from 0% (Thai) to 19% (Japanese); medical professionals ranged from 0% (Thai) to 7% (English).

However, human and animal studies indicate that the majority of gut viruses infect villous enterocytes, Viruses appear to have different affinities for enterocytes at different sites on the villus. Infection of enterocytes leads to cell death, extrusion into the lumen, and villous atrophy when the rate of cell production in the crypts cannot keep pace with the rate of enterocyte loss. This results in a reduced surface area as well as impairment of digestive and absorptive functions. This may also result in a net secretory state. All these changes, along with others such as reduced enzymatic activity and reduced epithelial integrity, may contribute to the induction of an acute but transient malabsorptive diarrhoea which may persist until the digestive/absorptive functions of the enterocyte are restored. However, if colonic compensation is sufficient to handle the increased fluid load, diarrhoea may not be evident. The roles of villous ischaemia, altered countercurrent exchanger or altered immune responses still remain uncertain and require further investigation.","publish_time":"1990-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salim, A.F.M.; Phillips, A.

However, given real building morphologies and particular architectural requirements for the modeling and data analysis, the frequently used methods in research work are unsuitable for practical application. Therefore, this study focuses on the practical application of CFD to bridge the gap between wind engineering and architectural design. This study aims to provide a framework to accurately predict the pedestrian level wind environment, and identify the wind-related design issues. The methods are provided to answer the questions encountered by wind consultants and architects, particularly those on the input boundary condition, simulation modeling, modeling verification, data collection and analysis. The hypothesis testing method is introduced in the framework to verify and evaluate the simulation results.

Respiratory tract infections are the most common childhood illnesses and paediatric SARS poses special problems in diagnosis because of its non-specific presentation. The main lessons learnt from the outbreak were: (1) despite well established guidelines on infection control precautions, poor understanding of underlying principles and deficiencies in compliance are common among healthcare professionals, especially during emergencies; (2) even a slight lapse can be fatal; and (3) over-protection can be counterproductive. Hence it is important to: (1) be protected to protect others; (2) be vigilant and prepared for emerging infections; (3) be proficient and scrupulous in infection control measures; (4) be apposite and practical on personal protective equipments to ensure sustainability; and (5) be dutiful and prompt in informing of potential threats and work closely with others.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, C.

Besides eliciting both local and systemic immunity, mucosal vaccination strategies that are non-invasive in nature may increase patient compliance and reduce the need for vaccine application by trained personnel. A relatively new concept is mucosal immunization using DNA vaccines. The advantages of DNA vaccines, such as the opportunity to combine the genetic information of various antigen epitopes and stimulatory cytokines, the enhanced stability and ease of production make this class of vaccines attractive and suitable for mucosal application. In contrast to the area of intranasal vaccination, only a few recent studies have focused on pulmonary immunization and the involvement of the pulmonary immune system in eliciting protective immune responses against inhaled pathogens. This review focuses on DNA vaccine delivery to the lung as a promising approach to prevent pulmonary-associated diseases caused by inhaled pathogens. Attractive immunological features of the lung as a site for immunization, the mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines and the pulmonary application of such vaccines using novel delivery systems will be discussed. We also examine pulmonary diseases prone to prevention or therapeutical intervention by application of DNA vaccines.","publish_time":"2005-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bivas-Benita, Maytal; Ottenhoff, Tom H.M.; Junginger, Hans E.; Borchard, Gerrit","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36eaec58a5d37602d2932074f554858a22acdfe3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114572.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016836590500266X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016836590500266X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["application of DNA vaccines","pulmonary application","mucosal application","pulmonary immunization","mucosal immunization","advantages of DNA vaccines","vaccine application","class of vaccines attractive","DNA vaccine delivery","mucosal surfaces","pulmonary immune system","pulmonary-associated diseases","pulmonary diseases prone","mucosal vaccination strategies","Abstract Mucosal immunity","inhaled pathogens","lung","eliciting protective immune responses","systemic immunity","area of intranasal vaccination","novel delivery systems","Attractive immunological features","therapeutical intervention","stimulatory cytokines","genetic information of various antigen epitopes","need","prevention","enhanced stability","ease of production","nature","promising approach","recent studies","involvement","mechanisms of action","patient compliance","line of defence","new concept","site","trained personnel","body","opportunity","contrast","review"],"language":"en"},

Methods Blood and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were taken from children and adults with fever (\u003E37.5\u02DAC) or history of fever (\u003C14 days) in Thailand and Myanmar. Results Of 773 patients with at least one blood or nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected, 227 (29.4%) had a target organism detected. Influenza virus type A was detected in 85/227 cases (37.5%), followed by dengue virus (30 cases, 13.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (24 cases, 10.6%) and Leptospira spp. (9 cases, 4.0%). Clinical outcome was similar between patients with a bacterial or a viral organism, regardless of antibiotic prescription. CRP was higher among patients with a bacterial organism compared to those with a viral organism (median 18mg/L, interquartile range [10-49] versus 10mg/L [\u22648-22], p-value 0.003), with an area under the curve of 0.65, 95% confidence interval (0.55-0.75).

The most conserved gene module defines RNA replication and is shared with plant and animal viruses in the alphavirus-like superfamily. A module of five genes that function in particle assembly and transport is a hallmark of the family Closteroviridae and was likely present in the ancestor of all three closterovirus genera. This module includes a homologue of Hsp70 molecular chaperones and three diverged copies of the capsid protein gene. The remaining genes show dramatic variation in their numbers, functions, and origins among closteroviruses within and between the genera. Proteins encoded by these genes include suppressors of RNA silencing, RNAse III, papain-like proteases, the AlkB domain implicated in RNA repair, Zn-ribbon-containing protein, and a variety of proteins with no detectable homologues in the current databases.

OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: The performance of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) and Verigene RV\u002B (RV\u002B) were compared in a retrospective analysis of 89 clinical specimens previously determined to be positive for the following viruses by our test of record, Prodesse (Pro): influenza A (29, FluA), influenza B (13, FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (12, RSV), human metapneumovirus (10, hMPV), parainfluenza (14, PIV), and adenovirus (10, AdV). Samples positive for influenza A, B or RSV were tested by both methods, while the remainder were tested by RP only. True positives were defined as positive by two or more assays. RESULTS: Limit of detection (LOD) analyses demonstrated Pro had the lowest LOD for all FluA strains tested, PIV1, PIV2 and AdV; RV\u002B had the lowest LOD for FluB; and RP had the lowest LOD for RSV, PIV3 and hMPV. Of the 55 samples tested by RV\u002B, all 54 true positive samples were positive by RV\u002B. Of the 89 samples tested by RP, 85 of the 88 true positive samples were positive by RP. From these results, the overall sensitivities for influenza A, B and RSV were 100% and 98% for RV\u002B and RP, respectively. The overall sensitivity of RP for all viruses was 97%. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these systems demonstrated excellent performance. Furthermore, each system has benefits which will ensure they will all have a niche in a clinical laboratory.","publish_time":"2014-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butt, S.A.; Maceira, V.P.; McCallen, M.E.; Stellrecht, K.A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a9e8419bd4239194c213e5699dd6c86b6835376.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172935.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214003102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.08.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214003102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Verigene RV","LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Samples positive","true positive samples","RSV","lowest LOD","influenza B","Verigene RV","overall sensitivity of RP","respiratory viruses","following viruses","FluB","True positives","hMPV","RESULTS","AdV","FilmArray Respiratory Panel","respiratory syncytial virus","FluA strains","excellent performance","overall sensitivities","clinical specimens","clinical laboratory","insensitivity of rapid tests","nucleic acid amplification tests","test of record","PIV1","PIV2","analyses","summary","systems","Prodesse","Limit of detection","PIV3","STUDY DESIGN","retrospective analysis","OBJECTIVES","human metapneumovirus","CONCLUSIONS","standard of care","adenovirus","parainfluenza","niche","methods","remainder","benefits","BACKGROUND","assays"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Palatine tonsil samples were obtained from 143 elective tonsillectomy patients. Adenovirus, bocavirus\u20101, coronavirus, enteroviruses, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected using PCR. The mRNA expression levels of IFN\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B2, IFN\u2010\u03B3, IL\u201010, IL\u201013, IL\u201017, IL\u201028, IL\u201029, IL\u201037, TGF\u2010\u03B2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, and Tbet were directly analyzed by quantitative RT\u2010PCR. RESULTS: Fifty percentage of subjects reported allergy, 59% had \u22651 nasopharyngeal viruses, and 24% had \u22651 intratonsillar viruses. Tonsillar virus detection showed a strong negative association with age; especially rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus detection showed positive association with IFN\u2010\u03B3 and Tbet expressions. IL\u201037 expression was positively associated with atopic dermatitis, whereas IFN\u2010\u03B1, IL\u201013, IL\u201028, and Tbet expressions were negatively associated with allergic diseases. Network analyses demonstrated strongly polarized clusters of immune regulatory (IL\u201010, IL\u201017, TGF\u2010\u03B2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, Tbet) and antiviral (IFN\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B2, IL\u201028, IL\u201029) genes.

Members of the DEAD-box helicase family have roles throughout cellular RNA metabolism from biogenesis to decay. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that cellular RNA helicases, including DEAD-box helicases, play roles in the recognition of foreign nucleic acids and the modulation of viral infection. As intracellular parasites, viruses must evade detection by innate immune sensing mechanisms and degradation by cellular machinery while also manipulating host cell processes to facilitate replication. The ability of DEAD-box helicases to recognize RNA in a sequence-independent manner, as well as the breadth of cellular functions carried out by members of this family, lead them to influence innate recognition and viral infections in multiple ways. Indeed, DEAD-box helicases have been shown to contribute to intracellular immune sensing, act as antiviral effectors, and even to be coopted by viruses to promote their replication. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions, as well as the cellular roles of DEAD-box helicases themselves, is limited in many cases. We will discuss the diverse roles that members of the DEAD-box helicase family play during viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taschuk, Frances; Cherry, Sara","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/437bd7428f04f7858147b98375ed47cace71ddf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033386/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DEAD-box helicases","cellular RNA helicases","cellular roles of DEAD","DEAD-box helicase family play","H helicases","ability of DEAD","cellular RNA metabolism","cellular machinery","Members","breadth of cellular functions","viral infections","diverse roles","broader group of cellular DExD","large family of conserved RNA-binding proteins","immune sensing mechanisms","intracellular immune sensing","innate recognition","viruses","replication","modulation of viral infection","intracellular parasites","recognition of foreign nucleic acids","detection","degradation","host cell processes","antiviral effectors","multiple ways","biogenesis","emerging evidence","sequence-independent manner","interactions","understanding"],"language":"en"},

A therapeutic drug that is effective against FIP has not yet been developed. Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. In the present study, we synthesized 30 overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, and investigated their inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of poorly replicative type I FIPV. The efficiency of type I FIPV infection was increased by diluting the virus with medium containing a polycation. Of the 30 peptides, I-S1-8 (S461-S480), I-S1-9 (S471-S490), I-S1-10 (S481-S500), I-S1-16 (S541-S560), and I-S1-22 (S601-S620) significantly decreased the infectivity of FIPV strain KU-2 while I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 exhibited marked inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. The inhibitory effects on FIPV infection of these 2 peptides on other type I and type II FIPV strains, feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) were also examined. These 2 peptides specifically inhibited type I and type II FIPV, but did FHV or FCV infection. In conclusion, the possibility of peptides derived from the S protein of type I FIPV strain KU-2 as anti-FIPV agents effective not only for type I, but also type II FIPV was demonstrated in vitro.","publish_time":"2015-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doki, Tomoyoshi; Takano, Tomomi; Koyama, Yusuke; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9e41cfac31d7d880bc70064339ed091cac992ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114445.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215001458; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215001458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FHV","FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIPV infection","FIPV strains","efficiency of type","replicative type","inhibited type","S protein of type","infectivity of FIPV strain KU","anti-FIPV agents effective","S1 domain","infection efficiency","FCV infection","overlapping peptides","possibility of peptides","marked inhibitory effects","feline herpesvirus","feline calicivirus","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis virus","FHV","viral protein amino acid sequences","cats","lethal disease","attention","new antiviral drugs","therapeutic drug","method","present study","S601-S620","S461-S480","S471-S490","S481-S500","S541-S560","medium","polycation","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We examined whether polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-12 receptor B1 (IL-12RB1) affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in Chinese SARS patients and healthy controls. The genotypes of 4SNPs on IL-12 RB1 gene, \u002B705A/G,\u002B1158T/C, \u002B1196G/C and \u002B1664 C/T, were determined by PCR-RFLP. Haplotypes were estimated from the genotype data using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. RESULTS: Comparison between patients and close contacts showed that individuals with the \u002B1664 C/T (CT and TT) genotype had a 2.09-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90\u20137.16) and 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.79\u201313.37) increased risk of developing SARS, respectively. For any of the other three polymorphisms, however, no significant difference can be detected in allele or genotype frequencies between patients and controls. Additionally, estimation of the frequencies of multiple-locus haplotypes revealed potential risk haplotypes (GCCT) for SARS infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that genetic variants of IL12RB1confer genetic susceptibility to SARS infection, but not necessary associated with the progression of the disease in Chinese population.","publish_time":"2008-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Fang; Liu, Wei; Zhang, Fang; Xin, Zhong-Tao; Wei, Mao-Ti; Zhang, Pan-He; Yang, Hong; Ly, Hinh; Cao, Wu-Chun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a5478dfe79fbf67551ac9261f190d899ba719b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2367437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18478121/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS infection","Chinese SARS patients","risk of developing SARS","genotype data","genotype frequencies","locus haplotypes","potential risk haplotypes","IL-12RB1","fold","genetic variants of IL12RB1confer genetic susceptibility","frequencies of multiple","Chinese population","healthy controls","polymorphisms of interleukin","GCCT","outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Cytokines","important roles","progression","allele","close contacts","receptor B1","antiviral action","disease","case-control study","SNPs","Comparison","individuals","TT","expectation-maximisation algorithm","RB1 gene","METHODS","BACKGROUND","significant difference","RESULTS","confidence interval","estimation","genotypes","CONCLUSIONS","PCR-RFLP"],"language":"en"},

The paper discusses China\u2019s growing involvement in global health. Health is an area where there is broad agreement over global priorities and, potentially, a fertile space to build new forms of collaboration that point the way towards the adaptation of global governance to a rapidly changing context. RESULTS: Drawing on previous analyses of China\u2019s management of change in its domestic health reforms and interviews with a range of stakeholders in China, the UK and Switzerland, the paper argues that China\u2019s engagement in global health is developing and diversifying rapidly in response to the central government\u2019s desire to see a greater role for China in global health. This diversification is part of a pattern of change management familiar from China\u2019s domestic reform experience. Explorations underway by a range of Chinese agencies form part of a process of rapid experimentation and experiential learning that are informing China\u2019s search for (a) new global role(s). CONCLUSIONS: China is undergoing rapid institutional innovation and developing capacity for greater global engagement, including in health; however, substantial, recent leadership commitments make clear Chinese agencies\u2019 need for continued exploration, innovation and rapid learning. How China engages globally is of significance to the world, not just China. The challenge for China, other global actors and multilateral organisations is to incorporate new approaches into existing global governance arrangements, including for the management of global health. This will require a willingness on all sides to learn from each other and invest the effort needed to build governance arrangements appropriate for the coming decades. This is not only important as a means of protecting global public health, but also as a demonstration of how governance arrangements can be adapted to the needs of a pluralistic global order in a context of rapid change.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Husain, Lewis; Bloom, Gerald","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83937f783bb8a444927466c1f4a30b6b7fb0e3fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357894/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00569-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of global health","China\u2019s global engagement","global public health","global actors","global priorities","global challenges","new global role","greater global engagement","adaptation of global governance","existing global governance arrangements","pluralistic global order","China\u2019s engagement","changing role of China","context of rapid change","domestic health reforms","China\u2019s search","rapid learning","previous analyses of China\u2019s management of change","rapid institutional innovation","China\u2019s growing involvement","governance arrangements appropriate","China\u2019s domestic reform experience","greater role","process of rapid experimentation","pattern of change management familiar","new approaches","paper","changing context","new forms of collaboration","range of Chinese agencies form","experiential learning","Recent years","range of stakeholders","clear Chinese agencies\u2019","recent leadership commitments","continued exploration","capacity","multilateral organisations","interviews","central government\u2019s desire","recognition","fertile space","broad agreement","UK","coming decades","needs","means","Switzerland","Explorations underway","response","area","effort","CONCLUSIONS","account","demonstration","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","significance","world","willingness","sides","diversification"],"language":"en"},

ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. Objective To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat\u00AE influenza A \u002B B assay. Study design Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (\u003C30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established pre-and post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. Results An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings \u003E $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of ED-based influenza testing using the Cobas Liat\u00AE assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively. Conclusion Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hansen, Glen T.; Moore, Johanna; Herding, Emily; Gooch, Tami; Hirigoyen, Diane; Hanson, Kevan; Deike, Marcia","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/675e32b5987702b74930412a5c023fe45f3f63d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29494950/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.02.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300465; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300465","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza diagnosis","ED management","Sensitivity of ED","ED-based testing","influenza season","ED settings","based influenza testing","sporadic ED visits","RT-PCR influenza testing","ED patient visits projects cost savings","overall cost savings","physician decision making","post-diagnosis management courses","patient management courses","pre-diagnosis plans","Physician responses","centralized lab testing","Cobas Liat","empiric","impact of rapid","antiviral prescribing","patients","patient care decisions","deferred admissions","B assay","Study design Prospective study","discharge status","hospital admissions","medical record","medical procedures","antibiotic prescribing","safe outpatient discharge","confirmation","targeted therapies","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","secondary documentation","reliable diagnostics","Abstract Background Emergency Departments","reduction","Evaluation","clinical touchpoints","Conclusion","days","Changes","cascade of events","cases","laboratory studies","specificity","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The intricate interplay between viral exploitation of cellular pathways and the intrinsic host defense mechanisms is difficult to unravel by traditional bulk approaches. In recent years, novel fluorescence microscopy techniques and single virus tracking have transformed the investigation of dynamic virus-host interactions. A prerequisite for the application of these imaging-based methods is the attachment of a fluorescent label to the structure of interest. However, their small size, limited coding capacity and multifunctional proteins render viruses particularly challenging targets for fluorescent labeling approaches. Click chemistry in conjunction with genetic code expansion provides virologists with a novel toolbox for site-specific, minimally invasive labeling of virion components, whose potential has just recently begun to be exploited. Here, we summarize recent achievements, current developments and future challenges for the labeling of viral nucleic acids, proteins, glycoproteins or lipids using click chemistry in order to study dynamic processes in virus-cell interactions.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Thorsten G.; Sakin, Volkan; M\u00FCller, Barbara","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f3006a21336451caedf41ab1791299a49831cc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6385038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700005/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24030481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-cell interactions","investigation of dynamic virus-host interactions","host cell","fluorescent labeling approaches","labeling of viral nucleic acids","single virus tracking","numerous interactions","chemistry","viral exploitation of cellular pathways","multifunctional proteins","novel toolbox","intrinsic host defense mechanisms","invasive labeling of virion components","dynamic processes","cellular factors","recent achievements","recent years","traditional bulk approaches","novel fluorescence microscopy techniques","viruses","virologists","future challenges","challenging targets","limited coding capacity","genetic code expansion","glycoproteins","current developments","attachment","conjunction","lipids","order","imaging-based methods","small size","intricate interplay","application","potential","prerequisite","structure","replication"],"language":"en"},

Among all 759 cases, 216 had one respiratory virus detected, and sole HBoV1 was detected in only 8 (3.7%). Acute HBoV1 infection was serologically diagnosed in 34 (22.5%) HBoV1\u2010DNA\u2010positive cases with another virus, compared to 4 (50.0%) cases with sole virus detection (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: HBoV1 was detected by PCR in one fifth of the children with non\u2010severe CAP and acute HBoV1 infection was serologically confirmed in one quarter of these cases.","publish_time":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nascimento\u2010Carvalho, Amanda C.; Vilas\u2010Boas, Ana\u2010Luisa; Fontoura, Maria\u2010Socorro H.; Xu, Man; Vuorinen, Tytti; S\u00F6derlund\u2010Venermo, Maria; Ruuskanen, Olli; Nascimento\u2010Carvalho, Cristiana M.","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e21defa06c535120d9971985e7e5f6dea5a95e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028159/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University Hospital","PCR"],"locations":["Salvador","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["Acute HBoV1 infection","CAP cases","sole HBoV1","PCR positive cases","non\u2010severe CAP patients","respiratory viruses","multiple virus","sole virus detection","respiratory complaints","causative agent of non\u2010severe community","recruited children","DNA","paired serum samples","convalescent serum samples","radiographic pulmonary infiltrate","consolidation","IgG responses","specific IgM","Brazil","NCT01200706","pneumonia","months","University Hospital","clinical trial","nasopharyngeal aspirate","role of human bocavirus","Salvador","prospective cohort","detections","NPAs","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","quarter","AIM","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objective To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization. Conclusions and Relevance This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lupi, Laura; Zaccone, Gregorio; Italia, Leonardo; Raffo, Michela; Tomasoni, Daniela; Cani, Dario S; Cerini, Manuel; Farina, Davide; Gavazzi, Emanuele; Maroldi, Roberto; Adamo, Marianna; Ammirati, Enrico; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Lombardi, Carlo M; Metra, Marco","journal":"JAMA cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219357/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","Exposure Cardiac involvement","cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","respiratory involvement","Measures Detection of cardiac involvement","cardiac care unit","right cardiac chambers","diffuse biventricular myocardial edema","diffuse biventricular hypokinesis","week","acute myopericarditis","complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe fatigue","marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema","entire biventricular wall","symptoms of heart failure","severe left ventricular dysfunction","presentation of acute myocardial inflammation","late gadolinium enhancement","NT-proBNP levels","diffuse ST elevation","coronavirus disease","upper respiratory tract symptoms","SARS-CoV","year-old woman","patient","dry cough","Findings","elevated high-sensitivity troponin T","year-old white woman","signs of interstitial pneumonia","levels of N","systolic dysfunction","influenzalike syndrome","coronary angiography","evidence of obstructive coronary disease","developed fatigue","onset of fever","case report","clinical course","positive result","increased wall thickness","ventricular ejection fraction","Importance Virus infection","T2-mapping sequences","echocardiography changes","terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay","apical segments","medical treatment","emergency department","Short tau inversion recovery","lopinavir","ritonavir","steroids","chloroquine","electrocardiography","Main Outcomes","antiviral drugs","Setting","Participant","Relevance","instrumental stabilization","circumferential pericardial effusion","dobutamine","chest radiography","nasopharyngeal swab","outbreak","Conclusions","common causes of myocarditis","Design","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, OA is the most common age-related joint disease affecting more than 80% of people older than the age of 55, an age burden also shared with the highest severity in COVID-19 patients. OA patients often show a large array of concomitant pathologies such as diabetes, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases that are again shared with COVID-19 patients and may therefore increase complications. Moreover, different OA treatments such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications. In this review we critically analyse the evidences on either negative or positive effect of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario.

Using a large sample of adolescents from across the US, this study examined adolescents\u2019 motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected March 29th and 30th 2020, two-weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the US. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents\u2019 motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents\u2019 anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.

Virus yield reduction experiments showed that ZnCl2 and ZnSO4 did not exhibit direct virucidal effects and did not affect adsorption of TGEV to ST cells. However, ZnCl2 and ZnSO4 markedly reduced viral titers as well as TGEV RNA and viral protein synthesis when applied during virus penetration and at different time points after viral cell entry. The results of the study suggest that zinc salts do not interfere with TGEV-cell binding but that they mediate antiviral effects through inhibition of viral penetration or egress or the intracellular phase of the viral life-cycle.","publish_time":"2012-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Zhanyong; Burwinkel, Michael; Palissa, Christiane; Ephraim, Eden; Schmidt, Michael F.G.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/744af6cb95bcfb1e44ca25b60f6f442d9dab3a29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117232.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22818659/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512003719; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.06.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512003719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","ST","TGEV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zinc sulfate","zinc salts","antiviral effects","ZnCl2","viral titers","ZnSO4","zinc chloride","Abstract Zinc","inhibition of viral penetration","viral cell entry","virus penetration","TGEV RNA","adsorption of TGEV","viral protein synthesis","viral life-cycle","TGEV-cell binding","direct virucidal effects","ST cells","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Virus yield reduction experiments","magnesium sulfate","different time points","intracellular phase","control salt","infection of swine testicle","egress","MgSO4","study","certain viruses","underlying mechanisms","results"],"language":"en"},

However, new genomic and functional data from organisms such as sponges, anemones and mollusks are helping redefine our understanding of these immune systems and their evolution. In this review, we will discuss our current knowledge of the innate immune pathways involved in sensing, signaling and inducing genes to counter viral infections in vertebrate animals. We will then focus on some central conserved players of this response including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cGAS-STING, attempting to put their evolution into perspective. To conclude, we will reflect on the arms race that exists between viruses and their animal hosts, illustrated by the dynamic evolution and diversification of innate immune pathways. These concepts are not only important to understand virus-host interactions in general but may also be relevant for the development of novel curative approaches against human disease.","publish_time":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majzoub, Karim; Wrensch, Florian; Baumert, Thomas F.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54458ee775b72a18830ed116a31336638b909fa7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426357/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080758","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune systems","diversification of innate immune pathways","sensing","dynamic evolution","receptors","understanding","model organisms","coordinated response","viral infections","Animal cells","animal hosts","viral threats","dedicated molecular systems","mice","development of novel curative approaches","sponges","functional data","fruit flies","Toll","human disease","current knowledge","virus-host interactions","viruses","humans","genes","studies","central conserved players","vertebrate animals","worms","RLRs","mollusks","TLRs","anemones","cGAS-STING","RIG","arms race","concepts","review","perspective"],"language":"en"},

Healthy broilers are resistant to inhaled E. coli, but previous infection with vaccine or virulent strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) predisposes birds for severe colibacillosis. We investigated whether IBV affects recruitment and function of phagocytic cells and examined NO production, phagocytic and bactericidal activity, and kinetics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes. Moreover, we measured cytokine mRNA expression in lung and spleen samples. Broilers were inoculated with IBV H120 vaccine or virulent M41 and challenged 5 days later with E. coli 506. A PBS control and E. coli group without previous virus inoculation were also included. Birds were sacrificed at various time points after inoculation (h/dpi). Inoculation with IBV induced extended and more severe colibacillosis than with E. coli alone. At 4dpi, the number of KUL-01\u002B PBMC in all E. coli-inoculated groups was significantly higher than in PBS-inoculated birds, which correlated with lesion scores. From 1 to 4dpi, NO production by PBMC from all E. coli-inoculated animals was elevated compared to PBS birds. Bactericidal activity of PBMC in IBV-inoculated animals at 7dpi was lower than in PBS- and E. coli-inoculated birds, but phagocytic capacity and recruitment were not severely impaired. In spleen samples of IBV-infected animals reduced expression of IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and IFN-\u03B3 mRNA was found 1dpi.

MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans. METHODS: This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18\u201350 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 \u00D7 10(9) viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2\u00B75 \u00D7 10(10) viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 \u00D7 10(10) viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-\u03B3-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578. FINDINGS: Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 \u00D7 10(10) viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66\u201381]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18\u201333]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5\u00B783 [95% CI 2\u00B711\u201317\u00B742], p\u003C0\u00B70001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p\u003C0\u00B7003) and IgG (p\u003C0\u00B70001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19\u201373]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58\u201393]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

With the assay of truncated 3a protein, it was shown that 3a might contain three transmembrane regions, and the second or third region was properly responsible for Golgi localization. By ultra-centrifugation experiment with different extraction buffers, it was confirmed that 3a was an integral membrane protein and embedded in the phospholipid bilayer.

Our study and other previous studies have shown that porcine IFN-\u03BB more efficiently curtails the infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the intestine epithelia than type I IFN, whereas IFN-\u03BB3 exerts a more potent effect than IFN-\u03BB1. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, and in particular, the transcriptional profile induced by IFN-\u03BB3 has not been reported. Here, to resolve the mechanism responsible for the disparity between IFN-\u03BB3 and type I IFN in anti-mucosal virus infection, we compared the transcription profiles induced by the two IFNs in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells by RNA-Seq. Our results showed that the pretreatment of IPEC-J2 cells with IFN-\u03BB3 resulted in the differential expression of 983 genes. In contrast, IFN-\u03B1 only modified the expression of 134 genes, and 110 of these genes were also observed in the response to IFN-\u03BB3. A transcriptional enrichment analysis indicated that IFN-\u03BB3 or IFN-\u03B1 regulates multiple cellular processes and that IFN-\u03BB3 activates more robust signaling pathways, particularly the antiviral Jak-STAT signaling pathway, than IFN-\u03B1. Furthermore, we verified the RNA-Seq results through an RT-qPCR analysis of IPEC-J2 cells and porcine enteroids. Moreover, transient expression of the porcine rsad2 and mx2 genes among the top 10 genes induced by IFN-\u03BB3 significantly inhibited PEDV infection. Collectively, the data showed that IFN-\u03BB3 induces a unique transcriptional profile that does not completely overlap with that induced by IFN-\u03B1 and strongly elicits a set of genes responsible for the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03BB3. These findings provide important knowledge regarding the elicited ISGs of type I and III IFNs in restricting porcine intestinal viral infection.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Liang; Xue, Mei; Fu, Fang; Yin, Lingdan; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/686258462f76bc196e1b056ebbbb93a6f53c982e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6811514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681286/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02394","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03BB3","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03BB1","porcine IFN-\u03BB","antiviral activity of IFN","mucosal infection","porcine intestinal viral infection","porcine rsad2","porcine enteroids","mx2 genes","infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","IPEC-J2","J2 cells","inhibited PEDV infection","set of genes responsible","anti-mucosal virus infection","IFNs","pretreatment of IPEC","transcriptional enrichment analysis","unique transcriptional profile","mechanism responsible","differential expression","transient expression","elicited ISGs of type","RT-qPCR analysis of IPEC","RNA-Seq results","underlying mechanism","antiviral Jak-STAT","multiple cellular processes","important knowledge","potent effect","pathways","critical role","previous studies","interferon-lambda","disparity","gastrointestinal tract","transcription profiles","intestine epithelia","findings","response","study","contrast","data"],"language":"en"},

Surgical masks (SMs) are used by dental professionals to reduce microorganism shedding from the mouth, nose, and face of the patient. AIMS: This aim of the study is to assess the bacterial and fungal presence and their prevalence over the contaminated surgical mask in dental practice. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was conducted with sample size 240 used surgical masks collected from 130 dental personnel. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with analysis involved inoculation of external and internal surfaces in an enrichment media for isolation of bacteria and fungi. Group of isolated bacteria and fungi were preliminarily identified by morphology and using Gram\u0027s stain and lacto-phenol cotton blue mediums. Data were analyzed using paired t-test; the significant level of P \u003C 0.050. RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of samples revealed bacteria Staphylococci 26.35% as a predominant species followed by Pseudomonas 17.82% and Streptococci 15.50%. Aspergillus fungal species was also present in 6.97%.

Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis (IBV) has been adapted to embryonated chicken eggs, primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, monkey kidney cell line Vero, and other human and animal cells. Here we report that acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity by amino acid mutations in the S protein determines the infectivity of IBV in cultured cells. Expression of S protein derived from Vero- and CK-adapted strains showed efficient induction of membrane fusion. However, expression of S protein cloned from the third passage of IBV in chicken embryo (EP3) did not show apparent syncytia formation. By construction of chimeric S constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, a point mutation (L857-F) at amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region of S protein was shown to be responsible for its acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity. Furthermore, a G405-D point mutation in the S1 domain, which was acquired during further propagation of Vero-adapted IBV in Vero cells, could enhance the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the protein. Re-introduction of L857 back to the S gene of Vero-adapted IBV allowed recovery of variants that contain the introduced L857. However, compensatory mutations in S1 and some distant regions of S2 were required for restoration of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein carrying L857 and for the infectivity of the recovered variants in cultured cells. This study demonstrates that acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity in S protein determines the selection and/or adaptation of a coronavirus from chicken embryo to cultured cells of human and animal origins.","publish_time":"2009-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Liu, Xiao Bo; Fang, Shou Guo; Tay, Felicia P.

The health sector is an important part of this transition. This article provides a historical account of the development of health care in China since 1949. It also focuses on health insurance and macroeconomic structural adjustment to less saving and more consumption. In particular, the question of how health insurance impacts precautionary savings is considered. Multivariate analysis using data from 1990 to 2012 is employed. The household savings rate is the dependent variable in 3 models segmented for rural and urban populations. Independent variables include out-of-pocket health expenditures, health insurance payouts, housing expenditure, education expenditure, and consumption as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). Out-of-pocket health expenditures were positively correlated with household savings rates. But health insurance remains weak, and increased payouts by health insurers have not been associated with lower levels of household savings so far. Housing was positively correlated, whereas education had a negative association with savings rates. This latter finding was unexpected. Perhaps education is perceived as investment and a substitute for savings. China\u2019s shift toward a more service-oriented economy includes growing dependence on the health sector. Better health insurance is an important part of this evolution. The organization and finance of health care is integrally linked with macroeconomic policy in an environment constrained by prevailing institutional convention. Problems of agency relationships, professional hegemony, and special interest politics feature prominently, as they do elsewhere. China also has a dual approach to medicine relying heavily on providers of traditional Chinese medicine. Both of these segments will take part in China\u2019s evolution, adding another layer of complexity to policy.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Hilsenrath, Peter","journal":"Inquiry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a46ec82f209bf008fd96e99c212ef8f0d4ae33b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5798748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831625/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0046958015620175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["health sector","health insurers","health insurance payouts","Better health insurance","out-of-pocket health expenditures","development of health care","finance of health care","health insurance impacts precautionary savings","household savings rates","lower levels of household savings","education expenditure","housing expenditure","consumption","macroeconomic policy","China\u2019s evolution","increased payouts","world economy","China\u2019s shift","service-oriented economy","macroeconomic structural adjustment","providers of traditional Chinese medicine","professional hegemony","growing dependence","models","decades","share of gross domestic product","environment","question","historical account","Problems of agency relationships","Independent variables","GDP","past","negative association","rapid transformation","layer of complexity","dual approach","prevailing institutional convention","urban populations","politics","organization","investment","Multivariate analysis","data","services","article","segments","substitute","finding","transition"],"language":"en"},

Methods Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. Findings All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified. Conclusion InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multi-faceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sansone, M.; Wiman, \u00C5.; Karlberg, M.

Zinc (Zn) salts, which are widely used as a dietary supplement in swine nutrition, have shown antiviral effects in vitro as well as in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of dietary zinc oxide supplementation on vaccination and challenge infection with PRRSV. FINDINGS: The clinical course of PRRS and the success of vaccination with an experimental inactivated vaccine were compared between animals receiving a conventional diet (50 ppm Zn, control group) and diets supplemented with Zn oxide (ZnO) at final Zn concentrations of 150 or 2,500 ppm. Pigs receiving higher dietary Zn levels showed a tendency towards higher neutralizing antibody levels after infection, while dietary Zn levels did not substantially influence the number of antiviral IFN-gamma secreting cells (IFN-gamma-SC) or percentages of blood immune cell subsets after infection. Finally, feeding higher dietary Zn levels reduced neither clinical symptoms nor viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher levels of dietary ZnO do not have the potential to stimulate or modulate systemic immune responses after vaccination and heterologous PRRSV infection to an extent that could improve the clinical and virological outcome.

Pathogenic IBV 3575/08 was isolated from broilers vaccinated with the attenuated viral vaccine derived from a Taiwan strain 2575/98. In this study, extensive investigations were conducted on the genome sequences, antigenicity, pathogenicity, and host immune responses of several IBV strains in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Sequence analyses revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 shared high homology in their structural genes, but not in non-structural accessory proteins such as 3a, 3b and 5b. Despite a high degree of homology in their spike protein genes, cross neutralization test showed low cross protection between 3575/08 and 2575/98, suggesting distinct antigenicity for the two strains. Animal challenge experiments exhibited strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity for 3575/08. In addition, early and prolonged viral shedding and rapid viral dissemination were observed. Immune gene expression profiling by PCR array showed chickens infected with 3575/08 had delayed expression of a subset of early innate immune genes, whereas chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuated-type 2575/08 revealed quick gene induction and efficient virus control. In summary, this study reveals a new IBV strain, which harbors a known local genotype but displays remarkably altered antigenicity, pathogenicity and host defenses.","publish_time":"2016-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Shu-Yi; Li, Yao-Tsun; Chen, You-Ting; Chen, Ting-Chih; Hu, Che-Ming J.; Chen, Hui-Wen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7803599fa57f39b06d7fd5bc8986420ae13fc2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5120290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876864/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep37725","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV strains","Pathogenic IBV","new IBV strain","structural genes","subset of early innate immune genes","Immune gene expression profiling","host immune responses","altered antigenicity","renal pathogenicity","free chickens","attenuated viral vaccine","distinct antigenicity","study","spike protein genes","prolonged viral shedding","rapid viral dissemination","shared high homology","high degree of homology","host defenses","Taiwan strain","wild-type","cross neutralization test","low cross protection","quick gene induction","efficient virus control","Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","PCR array","economic threat","specific-pathogen","Animal challenge experiments","broilers","known local genotype","genome sequences","addition","extensive investigations","poultry industry","non-structural accessory proteins","summary","Sequence analyses"],"language":"en"},

Disturbed protein folding process in the ER, termed ER stress, leads to the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) that encompasses a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. The UPR can either restore ER homeostasis or activate pro-apoptotic pathways depending on specific insults, intensity and duration of the stress, and cell types. ER stress and the UPR have recently been linked to inflammation in a variety of human pathologies including autoimmune diseases, infection, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disorders. In the cell, ER stress and inflammatory signaling share extensive regulators and effectors in a broad spectrum of biological processes. In spite of different etiologies, the two signaling pathways were shown to form a vicious cycle in exacerbating cellular dysfunction and causing apoptosis in many cells and tissues. However, the interaction between ER stress and inflammation in many of these diseases remains elusive. Further understanding of those issues may enable the development of novel therapies that spontaneously target these pathogenic pathways.","publish_time":"2015-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Stewart Siyan; Luo, Katherine L.; Shi, Lynn","journal":"Journal of Cellular Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eff5b68aa60b4d3766d143abb320e33687ae143.json; document_parses/pdf_json/be6f7452b45022cce431f50c1f62910f753fdcc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4659393.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.25098; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4659393?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26201832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER homeostasis","termed ER stress","UPR","pathogenic pathways","pro-apoptotic pathways","inflammation","cell types","normal cell function","autoimmune diseases","Disturbed protein","activation of unfolded protein response","effectors","infection","share extensive regulators","critical organelle","neurodegenerative disease","specific insults","variety of human pathologies","duration","intensity","cellular dysfunction","broad spectrum of biological processes","apoptosis","development of novel therapies","complex network of intracellular","metabolic disorders","endoplasmic reticulum","vicious cycle","cells","interaction","spite of different etiologies","tissues"],"language":"en"},

In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seddighi, Hamed","journal":"Disaster Med Public Health Prep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4aba1f92b8585b06134151a75d90f035a6f86926.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32216858/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.54","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["emergency organizations","emergency response","extension of mistrust","emergency missions","times of emergency","new policies","issue of public donation","outbreak","donation management","new law","common issue","COVID","new ones","wide range of organizations","efficiencies of humanitarian organizations","different categories","Iranian President","lack of unity","crisis management","lack of knowledge","Iranian officials","people\u2019s trust","poor public relations","result of different causes","engagement","effect","capabilities","judiciary system","ministers","sectors","operation","failure","area","Official authorities","step","major emergencies","crises","Ministry of Health","perception","policy","great flood","necessary facilities","earthquake","factors","years"],"language":"en"},

To achieve this goal, students should be knowledgeable and competent in infection control practice before proceeding to their training hospitals. Objectives This study assessed the nursing students\u0027 perception of the infection prevention climate in training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. It also examined the predictors of the students\u0027 perceptions. Design A quantitative, cross-sectional design was used. Methods This investigation was part of a large study conducted in six Saudi universities. A total of 829 Saudi nursing students were included in this study. Data were collected using the Leading Culture of Quality in Infection Prevention scale and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Ethical approval was obtained from the King Saud University, and permission was given by the administration of each participating university. Results The overall perception of nursing students indicated a modest infection prevention climate. Prioritization of quality and improvement orientation was rated as the highest dimensions, whereas psychological safety and supportive environment were the lowest. The nursing students in University F had the poorest perceptions among the six universities. The predictors of nursing student perception of their training hospitals\u0027 infection prevention climates were the university where they studied, their age, and participation in infection prevention seminars. Conclusions This article describes nursing students\u0027 perception of the infection prevention climate of their training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Results may provide a unique theoretical underpinning on the perception and factors that effect an infection prevention climate. Thereby, previous knowledge and literature may be expanded. Results can be used as a guide in establishing clinical policies in efforts toward improving the infection prevention climate.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tumala, Regie B.; Almazan, Joseph; Alabdulaziz, Hawa; Felemban, Ebaa Marwan; Alsolami, Fatmah; Alquwez, Nahed; Alshammari, Farhan; Tork, Hanan M.M.; Cruz, Jonas Preposi","journal":"Nurse Education Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b542c8da834562913e462ecf9e26cf4f4a7336b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131737.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691719302679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330405/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260691719302679; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2019.07.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Saud University","University F"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Infection Prevention scale","infection prevention seminars","modest infection prevention climate","Saudi nursing students","training hospitals\u0027 infection prevention climates","nursing students\u0027 perception","overall perception of nursing students","infection control practice","predictors of nursing student perception","clinical training","Saudi Arabia","Saudi universities","Results","students\u0027 perceptions","University F","participating university","King Saud University","large study","clinical policies","Prioritization of quality","poorest perceptions","cross-sectional design","Leading Culture of Quality","efforts","factors","psychological safety","highest dimensions","supportive environment","unique theoretical underpinning","improvement orientation","healthcare-associated infections","permission","guide","participation","Conclusions","article","age","investigation","administration","risk","Objectives","total","Ethical approval","inferential statistics","previous knowledge","literature","Abstract Background","Data","goal","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Genetic analysis of the viral genome revealed that this reassortant virus might be better adapted to humans than other avian influenza viruses. Molecular diagnostic methods are thus urgently needed in public health laboratories. In this study, a SYBR green-based one-step real time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was developed to detect the novel H7N9 virus. The primer pairs on the basis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene sequences of H7N9 viruses amplified subtype-specific fragments with Tm values of 80.77\u00B10.06\u00B0C for H7 and 81.20\u00B10.17\u00B0C for N9 respectively. The standard curves showed a dynamic linear range across 6 log units of RNA copy number (10(6) to 10(1) copies/ \u00B5l) with a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction for both H7 and N9 assays by using serial ten-fold diluted in-vitro transcribed viral RNA. In addition, no cross-reactivity was observed with seasonal H1N1, H1N1 pdm09, H3N2, H5N1 and H9N2 viruses as well as other human respiratory viruses. When the assay was further evaluated in H7N9 virus infected clinical samples, positive amplification signals were obtained in all of the specimens with the accordance between H7 and N9 assays. Therefore, the established SYBR green-based real time RT-PCR assay could provide a rapid, sensitive, specific and reliable alternative approach with lower costs for high throughput screening of suspected samples from humans, animals and environments in first line public health laboratories.","publish_time":"2013-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zheng; Fan, Huan; Qi, Xian; Qi, Yuhua; Shi, Zhiyang; Wang, Hua; Cui, Lunbiao; Zhou, Minghao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d38e11db887bf824a89621f65d384ef45e14955.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3835827.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278234/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","SYBR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["novel H7N9 virus","avian influenza viruses","H9N2 viruses","reassortant virus","N9 assays","H7N9 virus infected clinical samples","human respiratory viruses","real time RT-PCR assay","neuraminidase gene sequences of H7N9 viruses","humans","viral RNA","copies","SYBR green-based one-step real time reverse transcription-PCR","line public health laboratories","novel avian-origin influenza","established SYBR green","seasonal H1N1","H1N1 pdm09","viral genome","human infection","subtype-specific fragments","high throughput screening of suspected samples","log units of RNA copy number","lower costs","reliable alternative approach","H3N2","environments","dynamic linear range","hemagglutinin","positive amplification signals","animals","reaction","basis","H5N1","detection limit","Tm values","standard curves","fold","accordance","serial","cross-reactivity","fatal cases","\u00B5l","Genetic analysis","vitro","study","primer pairs","Molecular diagnostic methods","addition","specimens","China"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). METHODS: Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. FINDINGS: Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p\u003C0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational \u2018mask-off\u2019 settings compared to only 3 in workplace \u2018mask-on\u2019 settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit). CONCLUSION: Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Wong, Shuk-Ching; Chuang, Vivien Wai-Man; So, Simon Yung-Chun; Chen, Jonathan Hon-Kwan; Sridhar, Siddharth; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/033e5f41e79ed3f41183143b1353c6881abd7df9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/db571865fda1287d73b5900a18b95a52d01487ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177146.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302358; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302358?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":["France","U.S.","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["HKSAR community","wide mask usage","non-mask","incidence of COVID","control of COVID","mild COVID","Compliance of face mask usage","community-wide masking","effect of community","HKSAR general public","settings","healthy population","respiratory droplets","respiratory symptoms","terms of population density","respiratory viruses","Patients","BCG vaccination","healthcare system","social distancing measures","individuals","outpatient clinics","hospital wards","Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","confirmed cases","risk of transmission","emission of infected saliva","coronavirus disease","Chi square test of goodness","countries","persons","Epidemiological analysis","METHODS","clusters","workplace","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Italy","Germany","fit","range","South Korea","FINDINGS","days","Singapore","Spain","France","protocol"],"language":"en"},

Eighteen admissions were not associated with ARD (15 rubella infections, 3 immunization reactions). Of the remaining 131 ARD admissions, 17 were complicated by pneumonia and 114 were judged to have uncomplicated ARD. Within the latter group, evidence for infection by a single respiratory pathogen was obtained from 68 admissions; 11 admissions were associated with multiple infectious agents; and 35 admissions yielded no infectious agent(s). Despite immunization, adenoviruses, primarily ADV-4, were still the most common cause of ARD. Among non-adenovirus associated ARD admissions, rhinoviruses were the most common (10), followed by influenza A2 virus (7), group A streptococci (2) and herpesvirus hominis (2). Thus, in this initial study of ARD among recruits immunized with ADV-4 and ADV-7 vaccines, no other respiratory pathogens emerged to replace adenovirus types 4 and 7 as the major causes of ARD in military trainees.","publish_time":"1972-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"DUDDING, BURTON A; TOP, FRANKLIN H.; SCOTTT, ROBERT M.; RUSSELL, PHILIP K.; BUESCHER, EDWARD L.","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b725b83d0ad08436759bbd535e7658011b67518.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

Here, based on a novel genomic analysis of 2625 different viruses and 439 corresponding host organisms, we provide evidence of universal evolutionary selection for high dimensional \u2018silent\u2019 patterns of information hidden in the redundancy of viral genetic code. RESULTS: Our model suggests that long substrings of nucleotides in the coding regions of viruses from all classes, often also repeat in the corresponding viral hosts from all domains of life. Selection for these substrings cannot be explained only by such phenomena as codon usage bias, horizontal gene transfer and the encoded proteins. Genes encoding structural proteins responsible for building the core of the viral particles were found to include more host-repeating substrings, and these substrings tend to appear in the middle parts of the viral coding regions. In addition, in human viruses these substrings tend to be enriched with motives related to transcription factors and RNA binding proteins. The host-repeating substrings are possibly related to the evolutionary pressure on the viruses to effectively interact with host\u0027s intracellular factors and to efficiently escape from the host\u0027s immune system.

A PCR test amplifying the lktC-artJ intergenic region was evaluated and shown to be specific for the two species M. haemolytica and Mannheimia glucosida. All 90 aspirations were also analyzed for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine corona virus by antigen ELISA. Surprisingly, 63% of the apparently healthy calves harbored potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract, 60% of these samples contained either pure cultures or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. Among diseased calves, all samples showed growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. All of these were classified as pure culture or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. A higher percentage of the samples were positive for all bacterial species in the group of diseased animals compared to the clinically healthy animals, however this difference was only significant for M. dispar and M. bovirhinis. M. bovis was not detected in any of the samples. BRSV was detected in diseased calves in two herds but not in the clinically healthy animals. Among the diseased calves in these two herds a significant increase in haptoglobin and serum amyloid A levels was observed compared to the healthy calves. The results indicate that haptoglobin might be the best choice for detecting disease under field conditions. For H. somni and M. haemolytica, a higher percentage of the samples were found positive by PCR than by cultivation, whereas the opposite result was found for P. multocida. Detection of P. multocida by PCR or cultivation was found to be significantly associated with the disease status of the calves. For H. somni a similar association with disease status was only observed for cultivation and not for PCR.","publish_time":"2009-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angen, \u00D8ystein; Thomsen, John; Larsen, Lars Erik; Larsen, Jesper; Kokotovic, Branko; Heegaard, Peter M.H.; Enemark, J\u00F6rg M.D.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68d0bd06da5b8d3adc8f99235246d46e80b8704a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19186010/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811350800610X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811350800610X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy calves","diseased calves","samples","healthy animals","growth of pathogenic bacteria","PCR tests","cultivation","group of diseased animals","Mycoplasma dispar","Mannheimia haemolytica","Mycoplasma bovis","Mycoplasma bovirhinis","disease status","mixed culture","species Histophilus somni","lower respiratory tract","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bovine corona virus","bacterial species","Pasteurella multocida","haptoglobin","BRSV","higher percentage","different herds","significant increase","Mannheimia glucosida","pure cultures","Abstract Trans-tracheal aspirations","serum amyloid","parainfluenza","clinical signs of pneumonia","best choice","lktC-artJ intergenic region","antigen ELISA","levels","similar association","difference","field conditions","opposite result","Detection of","results"],"language":"en"},

Chymotrypsin-related proteases that form the PA clan in the MEROPS classification of proteases is one of the largest and most diverse group of proteases. The PA clan comprises serine proteases from bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses and chymotrypsin-related cysteine proteases from positive-strand RNA viruses. Despite low amino acid sequence identity, all PA clan proteases share a conserved double \u03B2-barrel structure. Using an automated structure-based hierarchical clustering method, we identified a common structural core of 72 amino acid residues for 143 PA clan proteases that represent 12 protein families and 11 subfamilies. The identified core is located around the catalytic site between the two \u03B2-barrels and resembles the structures of the smallest PA clan proteases. We constructed a structure-based distance tree derived from the properties of the identified common core. Our structure-based analyses support the current classification of these proteases at the subfamily level and largely at the family level. Structural alignment and structure-based distance trees could thus be used for directing objective classification of PA clan proteases and to strengthen their higher order classification. Our results also indicate that the PA clan proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses are related to cellular heat-shock proteases, which suggests that the exchange of protease genes between viruses and cells might have occurred more than once.","publish_time":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00F6nttinen, Heli A.

On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(\u2020) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.(\u00A7) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a \u0022Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,\u0022 which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Anita;

The current dominant management strategy in the UK is antibiotics, despite widespread publicity regarding antimicrobial resistance and evidence that the small benefits of antibiotics do not outweigh the harms. There is a need to address the rising problem of antibiotic resistance by providing credible alternative strategies, which reduce symptom burden. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Pelargonium sidoides root extract in order to warrant undertaking an independent clinical trial. We propose a feasibility study to demonstrate our ability to recruit and retain patients and conduct a placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs\u00AE7630 in lower respiratory tract infection where pneumonia is not suspected. Both the tablet and liquid formulations will be included. METHODS: The HATRIC trial is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study aiming to determine the potential to conduct a fully powered trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract as an alternative to the inappropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis in UK primary care. Primary care sites will be equally randomised to one of two formulation groups (tablet or liquid preparation). Additionally, within each site, patients will be evenly randomised to active or placebo treatment. Antibiotic consumption will be monitored during the trial, but the use of a delayed prescription strategy is encouraged. The target sample size for this study is 160 patients overall or 40 per arm, recruited from approximately 20 primary care sites. The analysis will be descriptive focusing on estimation with no formal comparison of groups taking place. DISCUSSION: If this trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and delivery, we will seek funding for a fully powered placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in primary care.

An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown. METHOD: The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study. The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement. The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection. RESULTS: 92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes. Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection. CONCLUSION: SMBG needs to be practiced on regular basis, especially among the patients with diabetes on insulin therapy. Most of the people surveyed were coping well with their Diabetes. Patients have reported that they were able to maintain proper dietary compliance and be more physically active at home during this lockdown. These findings need to be ascertained in larger sample of patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nachimuthu, Sukanya; Vijayalakshmi, R.; Sudha, M.; Viswanathan, Vijay","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b56e5c2dff09ebe90162326f52278ee2088898a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211739.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416527/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301181?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram","Whatsapp","SMBG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Diabetes Royapuram","management of diabetes","participants","online survey","lockdown period","lockdown announcement","Survey Monkey","registered patients","Covid infection","questions","online-based pilot survey","larger sample of patients","people","link","home blood glucose monitoring","proper dietary compliance","blood glucose levels","MV Hospital","regular exercise","viral infection","cross-sectional study","regular basis","anxiety","regularity","physical activity","diet control","questionnaire","challenge","telephone","insulin therapy","Oral consent","SMBG","Whatsapp","AIM","Type","CONCLUSION","findings","METHOD","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Rhinoviruses precipitate most exacerbations and increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. Here, we show that the ICS fluticasone propionate (FP) impairs innate and acquired antiviral immune responses leading to delayed virus clearance and previously unrecognised adverse effects of enhanced mucus, impaired antimicrobial peptide secretion and increased pulmonary bacterial load during virus-induced exacerbations. Exogenous interferon-\u03B2 reverses these effects. FP suppression of interferon may occur through inhibition of TLR3- and RIG-I virus-sensing pathways. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor (IFNAR1(\u2212/\u2212)) have suppressed antimicrobial peptide and enhanced mucin responses to rhinovirus infection. This study identifies type I interferon as a central regulator of antibacterial immunity and mucus production.

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of five phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia cava (E. cava) against PEDV. In vitro antiviral activity was tested using two different assay strategies: (1) blockage of the binding of virus to cells (simultaneous-treatment assay) and (2) inhibition of viral replication (post-treatment assay). In simultaneous-treatment assay, compounds 2\u20135 except compound 1 exhibited antiviral activities of a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) with the ranging from 10.8 \u00B1 1.4 to 22.5 \u00B1 2.2 \u03BCM against PEDV. Compounds 1\u20135 were completely blocked binding of viral spike protein to sialic acids at less than 36.6 \u03BCM concentrations by hemagglutination inhibition. Moreover, compounds 4 and 5 of five phlorotannins inhibited viral replication with IC(50) values of 12.2 \u00B1 2.8 and 14.6 \u00B1 1.3 \u03BCM in the post-treatment assay, respectively. During virus replication steps, compounds 4 and 5 exhibited stronger inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis in late stages (18 and 24 h) than in early stages (6 and 12 h). Interestingly, compounds 4 and 5 inhibited both viral entry by hemagglutination inhibition and viral replication by inhibition of viral RNA and viral protein synthesis, but not viral protease. These results suggest that compounds isolated from E. cava have strong antiviral activity against PEDV, inhibiting viral entry and/or viral replication, and may be developed into natural therapeutic drugs against coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Ryu, Young Bae; Kim, Young-Min; Song, Naaleum; Kim, Cha Young; Rho, Mun-Chual; Jeong, Jae-Ho; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Lee, Woo Song; Park, Su-Jin","journal":"Bioorg Med Chem","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127107.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.04.085; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089613004288; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089613004288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of viral replication","viral entry","viral protease","compounds","viral protein synthesis","stronger inhibition of viral RNA","simultaneous-treatment assay","post-treatment assay","PEDV","blocked binding of viral spike protein","hemagglutination inhibition","virus replication steps","strong antiviral activity","binding of virus","antiviral activities","different assay strategies","effective therapeutical treatment of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Ecklonia cava","phlorotannins","\u03BCM concentrations","late stages","early stages","severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea","swine","sialic acids","cells","prepdominat agent","natural therapeutic drugs","coronavirus infection","blockage","inhibitory concentration","values","study","results","ranging"],"language":"en"},

Barriers have included medicolegal issues surrounding provider reimbursement, interstate licensure, and malpractice liability as well as technological challenges. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited typical evaluation of patients with neurological issues and resulted in a surge in demand for virtual medical visits. Meanwhile, federal and state governments took action to facilitate the rapid implementation of telehealth programs, placing a temporary lift on medicolegal barriers that had previously limited its expansion. This created a unique opportunity for widespread telehealth use to meet the surge in demand for remote medical care. After initial hurdles and challenges, our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery at Penn Medicine has been overall positive from both the provider and the patients\u2019 perspective. One of the unique challenges we face is guiding patients to appropriately set up devices in a way that enables an effective neuro exam. However, we argue that an accurate and comprehensive neurologic exam can be conducted through a telemedicine platform, despite minor weaknesses inherent to absence of physical presence. Additionally, certain neurosurgical visits such as post-operative checks, vascular pathology, and brain tumors inherently lend themselves to easier evaluation through telehealth visits. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, telemedicine remains a promising and effective approach to continue neurologic patient care.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blue, Rachel; Yang, Andrew I.; Zhou, Cecilia; De Ravin, Emma; Teng, Clare W.; Arguelles, Gabriel R.; Huang, Vincent; Wathen, Connor; Miranda, Stephen P.; Marcotte, Paul; Malhotra, Neil R.; Welch, William C.; Lee, John YK.","journal":"World neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4b210990cc64b9b43d7cbf38d9e438cd41a6b31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020310378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020310378?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Penn Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["telemedicine platform","utilization of telemedicine","telehealth visits","unique challenges","substantial growth of telemedicine","medicolegal issues","widespread telehealth","virtual medical visits","demand","medicolegal barriers","neurosurgery","technological challenges","typical evaluation of patients","certain neurosurgical visits","neurologic patient care","remote medical care","effective neuro exam","comprehensive neurologic exam","neurological issues","provider reimbursement","effective approach","easier evaluation","rapid implementation of telehealth programs","unique opportunity","era of COVID","post-operative checks","minor weaknesses inherent","interstate licensure","vascular pathology","experience","malpractice liability","action","brain tumors","evidence","temporary lift","advantages","absence of physical presence","Penn Medicine","way","pandemic","state governments","initial hurdles","Abstract","patients\u2019 perspective","devices","expansion"],"language":"en"},

While the etiology of most pneumonia and ARI episodes is undiagnosed, a broad range of ARI-causing viruses circulate widely in South East Asia. However, the patterns and drivers of the seasonal transmission dynamics are largely unknown. Here we identify the seasonal patterns of multiple circulating viruses associated with hospitalizations for ARIs in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Methods Hospital based enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI is ongoing at Khanh Hoa General Hospital in Nha Trang. RT-PCR was performed to detect 13 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from enrolled patients. Seasonal patterns of childhood ARI hospital admissions of various viruses were assessed, as well as their association with rainfall, temperature, and dew point. Results Respiratory syncytial virus peaks in the late summer months, and influenza A in April to June. We find significant associations between detection of human parainfluenza 3 and human rhinovirus with the month\u0027s mean dew point. Using a cross-wavelet transform we find a significant out-of-phase relationship between human parainfluenza 3 and temperature and dew point. Conclusions Our results are important for understanding the temporal risk associated with circulating pathogens in Southern Central Vietnam. Specifically, our results can inform timing of routing seasonal influenza vaccination and for when observed respiratory illness is likely viral, leading to judicious use of antibiotics in the region.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Althouse, Benjamin M; Flasche, Stefan; Minh, Le Nhat; Thiem, Vu Dinh; Hashizume, Masahiro; Ariyoshi, Koya; Anh, Dang Duc; Rodgers, Gail L.; Klugman, Keith P.; Hu, Hao; Yoshida, Lay-Myint","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76b960b047a4c98a730382f5d743e38246b6ea74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110808.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.08.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218344886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30118916/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971218344886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["Khanh Hoa General Hospital"],"locations":["South East Asia","Nha Trang","Vietnam","Southern Central Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","results","seasonal patterns of multiple circulating viruses","Seasonal patterns of childhood ARI hospital admissions of various viruses","ARI episodes","respiratory illness","ARIs","enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI","human rhinovirus","broad range of ARI","detection of human parainfluenza","Methods Hospital","seasonal transmission dynamics","Nha Trang","temperature","month\u0027s mean dew point","timing of routing seasonal influenza vaccination","Respiratory syncytial virus peaks","Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections","Khanh Hoa General Hospital","circulating pathogens","significant associations","Southern Central Vietnam","late summer months","hospitalizations","children","temporal risk","nasopharyngeal samples","enrolled patients","judicious use of antibiotics","phase relationship","common causes of death","pneumonia","drivers","rainfall","region","South East Asia","etiology","years of age","Conclusions","cross-wavelet","RT-PCR"],"language":"en"},

ANIMALS: Client\u2010owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). PROCEDURES: Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. RESULTS: Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers \u22651:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP\u2010associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.","publish_time":"2013-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiggans, K.

Therefore, an immunosuppressive effect of in utero infection has been suggested. The aim of the present study was to characterise the changes of leukocyte populations in piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. A total of 27 liveborn uninfected control piglets and 22 piglets infected transplacentally with a Danish strain of PRRSV were included. At 2 and 4 weeks of age, 21 of 22 (96%) and 7 of 14 (50%) examined infected piglets were still viremic, whereas PRRSV could not be detected in the six infected piglets examined at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 2-, 4- and 6-week-old infected piglets and age-matched uninfected controls. The key observation in the present study is that high levels of CD8\u002B cells constitute a dominant feature in peripheral blood and BALF of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. In BALF, the average high level of CD8\u002B cells in 2-week-old infected piglets (33.4\u00B112.6%) was followed by a decline to 7.3\u00B13.0 and 11.1\u00B13.0% at 4 and 6 weeks of age. BALF of control piglets contained 1.6\u00B10.9, 2.3\u00B11.8 and 1.9\u00B10.5% CD8\u002B cells, only. In peripheral blood, however, the average number of CD8\u002B cells remained at high levels in the infected piglets throughout the post-natal experimental period (2.8\u00B11.9, 2.9\u00B11.8 and 3.2\u00B11.7\u00D7106 CD8\u002B cells/ml at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively). In the controls, the average levels of CD8\u002B cells were 0.9\u00B10.2, 1.9\u00B11.7 and 1.6\u00B10.5\u00D7106/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of CD2\u002B, CD4\u002BCD8\u002B and SLA-classII\u002B cells, respectively, in peripheral blood, together with the levels of CD2\u002B and CD3\u002B cells in BALF were increased in the infected piglets infected in utero compared to the uninfected controls. The kinetic analyses carried out in the present study reflect that in utero infection with PRRSV modulates immune cell populations in peripheral blood and BALF of surviving piglets. The observed changes are characterised by high levels of CD8\u002B cells supporting an important role of these cells in PRRSV infection. The present results, however, do not support the existence of post-natal immunosuppression following in utero infection with PRRSV.","publish_time":"2003-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nielsen, J; B\u00F8tner, A; Tingstedt, J.-E; Aasted, B; Johnsen, C.

Thus, RNA-targeting CRISPR system could be used for in vivo gene therapy.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Changyang; Hu, Xinde; Tang, Cheng; Liu, Wenjia; Wang, Shaoran; Zhou, Yingsi; Zhao, Qimeng; Bo, Qiyu; Shi, Linyu; Sun, Xiaodong; Zhou, Haibo; Yang, Hui","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.955286","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delivery of CasRx","intravitreal injection","specificity","adeno-associated virus","choroidal neovascularization","mouse model of age-related macular degeneration","knockdown Vegfa transcripts","high cleavage activity","attractive opportunity","smallest Cas13 family protein","area of laser","therapeutic applications","CRISPR system","RNA","gene therapy"],"language":"en"}]}

The nursing profession continues to face nursing shortages. One of the solutions recognized to alleviate the shortage is increasing the number of students graduating from nursing schools. It lacks a literature review synthesizing the current research about the impacts of faculty caring on nursing students\u0027 intent to graduate and indicate areas for future research. Methods This is a systematic literature review. The search of the literature was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Databases searched included MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Search. Search terms included \u0027attrition,\u0027 \u0027dropouts,\u0027 \u0027graduation rate,\u0027 \u0027faculty,\u0027 \u0027instructor,\u0027 \u0027professor,\u0027 \u0027nursing,\u0027 and \u0027caring.\u0027 Results Ten articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were conducted in the Associate Degree of Nursing and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. Nursing faculties played a significant role in students\u0027 intent to graduate by building students\u0027 confidence, creating a compassionate learning environment, and promoting students\u0027 competence. Faculties\u0027 caring behaviors, including respecting students, showing empathy, and using caring communication skills, were essential characteristics to affect students\u0027 learning environments. Conclusions The findings indicate that students\u0027 perceptions of faculty caring can affect their perceptions of the learning environment and sense of belonging, and therefore, impact their intent to graduate. Students\u0027 perceptions of their instructors\u0027 caring behaviors are instrumental in motivating them to continue learning.

Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the mere hope of effectiveness of potential treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine, has led to surges in demand for these products, and many pharmacists are already informally reporting shortages through social channels. As manufacturers and wholesale distributors struggle to fulfill orders for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, short-term price increases may seem reasonable in a free market when demand increases. However, any price increases by manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies might be seen as exploitive gouging of consumers during a declared emergency. In addition to concerns of price gouging, increases in prescription drug utilization during the pandemic may lead to increases in spending for all payers as members may be treated for COVID-19. This article explores pharmaceutical supply chain and drug pricing nuances that may cause problems for payers and pharmacies as the country battles this global pandemic.

The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars-CoV-2. METHODS Pubmed, WebOfScience and Covid-dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID-19 terminology and neurology terminology up to May 10th 2020. Social media channels were followed-up between March 15th and May 10th 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and auto-immune disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. No antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention are available and the long-term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain especially with regards to the neurological system.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vonck, Kristl; Garrez, Ieme; De Herdt, Veerle; Hemelsoet, Dimitri; Laureys, Guy; Raedt, Robrecht; Boon, Paul","journal":"European journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurological symptoms","patients","various neurological manifestations","RESULTS Neurological manifestations","combination of COVID","moderate COVID","severe COVID","neurological system","cranial nerve manifestations","Covid-dedicated databases","direct viral neurological injury","Cranial nerve symptoms","nasal symptoms","case reports","case series","autoimmune mechanisms","neurology terminology","clinical practice","rapid clinical deterioration","possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars","acute cerebrovascular diseases","indirect neuroinflammatory","impaired consciousness","immune disorders","long-term consequences","human health","gustatory dysfunctions","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome","vaccines","prevention","WebOfScience","regards","large studies","neurologist","useful summary","respiratory tract","review","early stage","METHODS Pubmed","antiviral treatments","identified manuscripts","CONCLUSION Physicians","Social media channels","INTRODUCTION Infections","coronaviruses","study","postings","scope","aim"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89\u00B11.117), SDS (50.13\u00B11.813), and PCL-C (50.13\u00B11.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P\u003C0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07\u00B13.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%.

The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the herbal medicine, Dangguijagyag-san, relative to those of active control, Gamisoyo-san, and a placebo control for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods This protocol details a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, investigator-initiated, controlled trial evaluating treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Two hundred and forty participants will be randomly divided into one of three groups: 1) the Dangguijagyag-san experimental group (EG) (n = 105), 2) the Gamisoyo-san active control group (ACG) (n = 30), and 3) the placebo control group (PCG) (n = 105). The interventions will be administered for two menstrual cycles, and the follow-up will be carried out for the following six menstrual cycles. The primary outcomes are difference in response rates between the EG and the ACG (non-inferiority comparison) and difference in changes from baseline in average pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale between the EG and PCG (superiority comparison). The secondary outcomes are pain scores derived from pain assessment tools (verbal multidimensional scoring system, retrospective symptom scale, and short form McGill pain questionnaire), dosage of analgesics, pattern diagnosis questionnaires, and short form 36 health survey. Adverse events and vital signs will be checked at every visit, and laboratory tests will be performed for safety evaluation. Discussion The results of this clinical trial will offer evidence for the efficacy and safety of Dangguijagyag-san for primary dysmenorrhea.

Women reported barriers to protecting themselves given widespread unstable housing and complex health needs, though many tried to follow COVID-19 prevention recommendations. Women expressed dissatisfaction with the suspension of research activities, as the pandemic contributed to a heightened need for study incentives, such as cash, emotional support, and other resources. COVID-19 is illuminating disparities between those who can follow recommended actions to prevent infection and those who lack resources to do so.

Furthermore, abnormally processed RNAs can cause a variety of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, and cancer. Especially in cancer development, aberrant RNAs caused by deregulated RNA modifiers or regulators are related to progression. Accumulating evidence has reported that aberrant RNAs promote carcinogenesis in many cancers, including liver cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers, in which abnormal RNA processing occurs in normal cells. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the precise roles and mechanisms of disease-related RNA processing in various cancers for the development of therapeutic interventions. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of variations in the RNA life cycle and the biological impacts of RNA variations on carcinogenesis will be discussed, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tumor malignancies will be provided.

The declaration of a pandemic posed challenges to many countries, prominent among them communication with the public to gain its cooperation. What singles out Israel\u0027s management of the COVID-19 crisis from other countries is that Israel is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis that impacts its management of the health crisis. OBJECTIVE To examine the Israeli Public\u0027s response to the Israeli government\u0027s emergency instructions against the pandemic in terms of correlations between: (1) overall risk perceptions and crisis management, (2) overall risk perceptions and economic threat, (3) crisis management and the compliance to behavioral guidelines, (4) crisis management and economic threat, and comparisons between (1) crisis management and spokesperson credibility, and (2) crisis management and source of information credibility. METHODS The sample was planned using a Qualtrics XM online survey that provided the quick and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. Self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (n=1056) through social network posts calling on the general public (18\u002B) to answer the survey. RESULTS Participants aged 65\u002B perceived higher personal risk compared to aged 18-30 (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and compared to aged 46-64 (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI=0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between: (1) overall risk perceptions and the attitudes towards crisis management (r=0.19, p\u003C0.001), (2) overall risk perceptions and economic threat (r=0.22, p\u003C0.001), (3) attitudes towards crisis management and the compliance to behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, p\u003C0.001), (4) attitudes towards crisis management and economic threat (r=-0.15, p\u003C0.001). Participants for whom the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. Significant lower evaluation of the crisis management was expressed by participants for whom infectious diseases specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the MOH website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom the scientific articles were the most credible source of information, evaluated the crisis management less than those who the WHO/CDC websites or HMO/Hospital websites \u0026 HCWs were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS The higher the public\u0027s trust and evaluation of the crisis management, the more the public complies with the guidelines. It was also found that the crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the whole public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemic crises, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences and therefore it is impossible to communicate and focus only on the health risk without communicating the economic and social risks as well.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Hijazi, Rana; Abed Elhadi Shahbari, Nour","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO","Qualtrics XM","MOH","HMO/Hospital"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["crisis management higher","health crisis","Israel\u0027s management","deep constitutional crisis","economic threat","overall risk perceptions","credible source of information","health risk","COVID","RESULTS Participants","perceived higher personal risk","attitudes","source of information credibility","credible spokespersons","pandemic","behavioral guidelines","general public","online questionnaire","compliance","social consequences","Qualtrics XM online survey","spokesperson credibility","social risks","countries","groups","Significant correlations","mean difference","Israeli Public\u0027s response","Self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling","social network posts","Significant lower evaluation","public\u0027s trust","Hospital websites","CDC websites","terms of correlations","Israeli government\u0027s emergency instructions","HMO","infectious diseases specialists","effective distribution","comparisons","challenges","HCWs","midst","prime minister","MOH website","scientific articles","sample","OBJECTIVE","communication","CONCLUSIONS","epidemic crises","declaration","METHODS","cooperation","way","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In tumor cells, the VEGFA-VEGFR2 binding activates autocrine survival and migration signaling in angiogenesis independent manner. The present in vitro study investigated the effects of single and combined treatments with Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel on cell growth and migration highlighting the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the two drugs in gastric cancer cells. Cell growth and motility were investigated in human gastric cancer cell lines characterized by different tumorigenicity. The inhibitory effect on cell growth exerted by both drugs was potentiated by their combination and was synergistic. Ramucirumab was able to enhance the inhibitory effect exerted by Paclitaxel on cell cycle progression. A synergistic action was also observed in the expression of proteins crucial for cell motility, microtubule organization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of VEGFR2 expression was obtained by the drug combination. These findings highlighted the importance of the combined treatment to strongly inhibit all the main molecules of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways thus preventing possible reactivations due to cross-talk phenomena. The combined treatment with Ramucirumab seems to be a promising option to overcome the Paclitaxel resistance.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Refolo, Maria Grazia; Lotesoriere, Claudio; Lolli, Ivan Roberto; Messa, Caterina; D\u0027Alessandro, Rosalba","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64195-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell growth","cell motility","Ramucirumab","cell cycle progression","human gastric cancer cell lines","gastric cancer cells","Paclitaxel resistance","advanced gastric cancer","migration","combined treatments","inhibitory effect","synergistic inhibition of VEGFR2 expression","drugs","drug combination","synergistic action","disease progression","tumor cells","VEGFA-VEGFR2 binding","expression of proteins crucial","microtubule organization","patients","autocrine survival","Akt","MAPK pathways","possible reactivations","PI3K","mTOR","effects of single","epithelial-mesenchymal transition","different tumorigenicity","angiogenesis independent manner","interaction","promising option","mechanisms","main molecules","study","chemotherapy","importance","monotherapy","phenomena","findings"],"language":"en"},

To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples1-3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens4-6. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanoliter droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of \u003E4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with \u226510 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. CARMEN\u0027s intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test \u003E300-fold.

Because neurodegeneration limits capacity for neuroplasticity, it is not clear whether AE would induce CSE changes in people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS People with progressive MS (n = 10) requiring ambulatory assistive devices completed a graded maximal exercise test. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to quantify body fat and lean mass. Before and following one 40-minute AE session using body weight-supported (\u003C10% support) treadmill at moderate intensity, CSE was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Variables included resting and active motor thresholds, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, recruitment curves, and length of the cortical silent period (CSP). RESULTS Aerobic exercise reduced inhibition (shorter CSP) and increased excitation (increased MEP amplitude) only in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand. Controlling for age, higher fitness and lower body fat significantly predicted exercise-induced reduction in resting motor threshold (\u0394R = \u002B0.458, P = 0.046) and CSP (\u0394R = \u002B0.568, P = 0.030), respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite high levels of disability, capacity for exercise-induced neuroplasticity was retained among people with progressive MS. The hemisphere contralateral to the weaker hand was resistant to exercise-induced CSE changes, suggesting less neuroplastic potential. Lower fitness and higher body fat were associated with diminished exercise-induced CSE benefits, suggesting that therapists should consider interventions aimed at improving fitness and combating sedentarism to ultimately enhance the benefits of exercise on the brain.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A302).","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaves, Arthur R; Devasahayam, Augustine J; Kelly, Liam P; Pretty, Ryan W; Ploughman, Michelle","journal":"Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/npt.0000000000000308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AE","CSE","CSP","Supplemental Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benefits of exercise","exercise-induced neuroplasticity","exercise-induced CSE changes","exercise-induced reduction","diminished exercise-induced CSE benefits","RESULTS Aerobic exercise","single bout of aerobic exercise","higher body fat","lower body fat","graded maximal exercise test","body weight","progressive MS","higher fitness","Lower fitness","motor evoked potential","resting motor threshold","METHODS People","shorter CSP","\u0394R","biomarker of neuroplasticity","active motor thresholds","increased MEP amplitude","progressive multiple sclerosis","minute AE session","Video Abstract available","increased excitation","hemisphere contralateral","neuroplastic potential","weaker hand","stronger hand","neurodegeneration limits capacity","amplitudes","length","inhibition","ambulatory assistive devices","high levels of disability","recruitment curves","brain","corticospinal excitability","moderate intensity","cortical silent period","Supplemental Digital Content","CONCLUSIONS","PURPOSE","authors","insights","treadmill","therapists","age","Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry","transcranial magnetic stimulation","support","DISCUSSION","BACKGROUND","Variables","lean mass","interventions","sedentarism"],"language":"en"},

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

This study aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting 3-month mortality risk in patients with ischemic stroke attributed to artery occlusion in anterior circulation who received successful endovascular thrombectomy treatment. Methods and Results Patients with successful endovascular thrombectomy (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction IIb or III) were enrolled from a multicenter registry as the training cohort. Step-wise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion was utilized to establish the best-fit nomogram. The discriminative value of the nomogram was tested by concordance index. An additional 224 patients from 2 comprehensive stroke centers were prospectively recruited as the test cohort for validating the new nomogram. Altogether, 417 patients were enrolled in the training cohort. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10), poor pretreatment collateral status (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.18-3.85), baseline blood glucose level (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 9.51; 95% CI, 4.54-19.92), and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.12) were associated with mortality and were incorporated in the nomogram. The c-index of the nomogram was 0.835 (95% CI, 0.785-0.885) in the training cohort and 0.758 (95% CI, 0.667-0.849) in the test cohort. Conclusions The nomogram, composed of age, pretreatment collateral status, baseline blood glucose level, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, may predict risk of mortality in patients with ischemic stroke and treated successfully with endovascular thrombectomy.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaohao; Yuan, Kang; Wang, Huaiming; Gong, Pengyu; Jiang, Teng; Xie, Yi; Sheng, Lei; Liu, Dezhi; Liu, Xinfeng; Xu, Gelin","journal":"Journal of the American Heart Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.014899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["III","National Institutes of Health","National Institutes of Health Stroke"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new nomogram","training cohort","Results Patients","trajectory of ischemic stroke patients attributable","test cohort","best-fit nomogram","baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score","successful endovascular thrombectomy treatment","comprehensive stroke centers","baseline blood glucose level","risk of mortality","symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","month mortality risk","poor pretreatment collateral status","artery occlusion","concordance index","c-index","large vessel occlusion","modified Thrombolysis","anterior circulation","Akaike information criterion","Step-wise logistic regression","Cerebral Infarction IIb","Methods","multicenter registry","odds ratio","discriminative value","Conclusions","study"],"language":"en"},

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (Lin M, Tseng H-K, Trejaut JA, Lee H-L, Loo J-H, Chu C-C, Chen P-J, Su Y-W, Lim KH, Tsai Z-U, Lin R-Y, Lin R-S, Huang C-H. BMC Med Genet 4:9. 2003.). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of viral severity in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Austin; David, Julianne K; Maden, Sean K; Wood, Mary A; Weeder, Benjamin R; Nellore, Abhinav; Thompson, Reid F","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00510-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lee H-L","Chu C-C","Chen P-J","Su Y-W","Lim","Tsai Z-U","Lin","Huang C-H."],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HLA-B","HLA typing","Pairing HLA","conserved SARS-CoV","high-risk HLA types","diversity of HLA alleles","Chu C-C","global distributions of HLA types","Huang C-","C genotypes","individuals","course of COVID","Lin R-Y","common human coronaviruses","Lin R-S","Loo J-H","Lee H","Tseng H","cross-protective immunity","virus responsible","population","fewest predicted binding peptides","human leukocyte antigen","assessment of viral severity","silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class","IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation","Genetic variability","cross-protective T-cell","coronavirus disease","Su Y-W","Chen P-J","potential epidemiological ramifications","severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Lim KH","Tsai Z-U","genes","current pandemic","prior exposure","setting","major histocompatibility complex","lsqb","Trejaut JA","BMC Med Genet","different immune responses","susceptibility","rsqb","affinity","testing","greatest capacity","higher risk","vaccine","development","vaccination","proteome"],"language":"en"},

The decrease in clinical opportunities due to the limitations on elective surgical cases and office visits as well as potential resident redeployment could lead to a decline in overall experience as well as key indicator cases. It is important that we closely monitor the impact of this pandemic on resident education and ensure the implementation of alternative learning strategies while maintaining an emphasis on safety and well-being.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crosby, Dana L; Sharma, Arun","journal":"Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820922502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resident education","potential resident redeployment","course of training","pandemic","Otolaryngology residency training programs","current resident cohort","widespread impact","elective surgical cases","key indicator cases","international medical crisis","novel challenge","office visits","limitations","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","emphasis","implementation of alternative learning strategies","overall experience","decline","chronicity","clinical opportunities","safety","decrease","well-being","date"],"language":"en"},

The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03B1 (HIF1\u03B1) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1\u03B1 signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage\u0027s infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid \u03B2-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Shan; Li, Qian; Yu, Yiyi; Cui, Yuehong; Li, Wei; Liu, Tianshu; Liu, Fenglin","journal":"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-020-02598-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC","FAO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GC tumor","chemoresistance of GC cells","inhibiting FAO of tumor cells","tumor cell sensitivity","tumor-associated macrophages","efficacy of GC treatment","FU treatment","treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents","recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype","type TAMs","preferred treatment","chemoresistance development","GDF15","clinic treatments of gastric cancer","advanced stage gastric cancer","accumulation of M2","activation of HIF1\u03B1","growth differentiation factor","hypoxia-inducible factor","new therapeutic targets","immune microenvironment","rise","etomoxir","fatty acid \u03B2-oxidation","cross","tremendous challenge","patients","antibody","underlying molecular mechanism","expression of high","mobility group box","reactive oxygen species","turn","results","novel insight","Chemotherapy","macrophage\u0027s infiltration","fluorouracil","study"],"language":"en"},

Items used in instruments were grouped under the themes of knowledge, attitudes and practices. Determinants of health literacy were grouped into five domains (socio-demographic, medical, psychological/psychiatric, health systems related and others). Data synthesis: Of 2,065 articles screened, 70 articles were included. 21, 17 and 32 studies evaluated health literacy related to COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. The rates of low pandemic health literacy ranged from 4.3 to 57.9% among medical-related populations and 4.0% to 82.5% among non-medical populations. Knowledge about symptoms and transmission of infection; worry about infection and, practices related to mask usage and hand hygiene was most frequently evaluated. Socio-demographic determinants of health literacy were most studied, where higher education level, older age and female gender were associated with better health literacy. No studies evaluated outcomes associated with health literacy. Limitations Non-English articles were excluded. Conclusion: The level of pandemic related health literacy is sub-optimal. Healthcare administrators need to be aware of health literacy determinants when formulating policies in pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seng, J. J. B.; Yeam, C.

Widespread testing and tracing efforts are employed in many countries in order to contain and mitigate this pandemic.

This indicates that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. Collecting raw sewage data, representing specific districts, and crosslinking this data with the number of infected people from each location, will enable us to derive and provide quantitative surveillance tools. In particular, this will provide important means to (i) estimate the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements (ii) manage the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently (and similarly, verify disease elimination).

Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea.

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations.

However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens\u0027 welfare. In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lampert, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38dbdfe3298b4d8b1ead7f1c3820e54324e59a6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108167v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-restrictive quarantine periods","countries","governments","longer periods of restrictive quarantines","better policy","quarantine policies","interstate travel","country","turn","low level","infection level","decentralized government","decentralized governance","strategies","literature","higher prevalence","COVID","governor","states","mobility restrictions","publically available data","outbreak","novel Coronavirus","individuals","parameter values","game theory model","borders","disease","timing","major questions","citizens\u0027 welfare","decision"],"language":"en"},

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

We first used serial computed tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical locations (peripheral\u003Ecentral, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes. PET/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6\u201312 days post-exposure.

Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests. We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200\u002B, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests. The mean (range) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (3.9-5.5) kPa and 4.6 (range 4.1-5.3) kPa before and after 1 hour of usage. The mean (range) respiratory rate was 16.5 (11-24) min-1 and 17.4 (15-22) min-1 before and after 1 hour of usage.

Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data.

India, with its unique challenges in fighting this pandemic, imposed one of the worlds strictest and largest population-wide lockdown on 25 March 2020. Here, we estimated key epidemiological parameters and evaluated the effect of control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in India and its states. Through a modeling approach that accounted for asymptomatics, we assessed the impact of lockdown relaxation and increased testing. Methods: We estimated the basic reproduction number and effective reproduction number at a national and state level in India after adjusting for imported cases and reporting lag using established statistical methods, using time-series data from 4 March to 25 April 2020. Using a dynamic SEIR-QDPA model fitted to data from India, we forecasted the size and temporality of the ongoing first wave while accounting for the interventions in place. We used the model to simulate lockdown relaxation under various scenarios to evaluate its effect on the size and temporality of the second wave. We also evaluated the feasibility of increased testing as a containment strategy after restrictions are relaxed and its impact on the epidemic size and resumption of socio-economic activities, while taking into account the changes in transmission dynamics brought about by asymptomatic carriers. Findings: The median delay from symptom onset to detection (reporting lag) was estimated to be 2{middle dot}68 days (95% CI 2{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00) with an IQR of 2{middle dot}03 days (95% CI 1{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00). The R0 for India was estimated to be 2{middle dot}083 (95% CI 2{middle dot}044-2{middle dot}122 ; R2 = 0{middle dot}972), while the Rt gradually down trended from 1{middle dot}665 (95%CI 1{middle dot}539-1{middle dot}789) on 30 March to 1{middle dot}159 (95% CI 1{middle dot}128-1{middle dot}189) on 21 April. 60{middle dot}7% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our sample were found to be asymptomatic. We observed that delaying the lockdown relaxation increases the time to new rise in active cases after the relaxation in a linear fashion. If lockdown was reintroduced after a fixed relaxation period, the magnitude of the second peak could be reduced by delaying the relaxation and decreasing the duration of relaxation. These benefits were greater in case of a gradual relaxation as compared to a sudden lifting of lockdown. We found that detecting a higher proportion of cases through testing significantly decreases the total infections. This positive impact of testing progressively increased at higher transmission rates when restrictions were relaxed. We found that similar containment targets could be achieved by both, a combination of high testing and less social restrictions, and a combination of lower testing with intensive social distancing. Interpretation: The nationwide social distancing interventions in India since 25 March have reduced the effective transmission levels, though sub-threshold Rt remains to be achieved. If lockdown is to be extended, additional benefits for mitigating the second wave can be achieved if it is extended farther after the peak of active cases has passed. Intensive social distancing is inherently enough to contain the epidemic, however, testing will play a pivotal role in the lockdown exit strategy by impeding the epidemic growth enough to allow for a greater resumption of socio-economic activities, thus minimizing the social and economic fallout resulting from severe restrictions. Considering that asymptomatics play an undeniable role in the transmission of COVID-19, dependence on presence of symptoms for control strategies, behavioural changes and testing should be reduced.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, M.; Mohanta, S.

Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker \u201Cretinoic acid\u201D in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5\u2032\u2013AGGTCA\u20133\u2032) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required).

No significant overall associations between selected SNPs and the risk of IA were found in this large cohort. Although a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-stratified analysis revealed that carriers of the IRF4(rs12203592T/T) genotype had a six-fold increased risk of developing the infection when compared with those carrying the C allele (OR(REC) = 6.24, 95%CI 1.25\u201331.2, P = 0.026), the association of this variant with IA risk did not reach significance at experiment-wide significant threshold. In addition, we found an association of the IRF4(AATC) and IRF4(GGTC) haplotypes (not including the IRF4(rs12203592T) risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA but the magnitude of the association was similar to the one observed in the single-SNP analysis, which indicated that the haplotypic effect on IA risk was likely due to the IRF4(rs12203592) SNP. Finally, no evidence of significant interactions among the genetic markers tested and the risk of IA was found. These results suggest that the SNPs on the studied genes do not have a clinically relevant impact on the risk of developing IA.","publish_time":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lupia\u00F1ez, Carmen B.; Villaescusa, Mar\u00EDa T.; Carvalho, Agostinho; Springer, Jan; Lackner, Michaela; S\u00E1nchez-Maldonado, Jos\u00E9 M.; Canet, Luz M.; Cunha, Cristina; Segura-Catena, Juana; Alcazar-Fuoli, Laura; Solano, Carlos; Fianchi, Luana; Pagano, Livio; Potenza, Leonardo; Aguado, Jos\u00E9 M.; Luppi, Mario; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Lass-Fl\u00F6rl, Cornelia; Einsele, Hermann; V\u00E1zquez, Lourdes; R\u00EDos-Tamayo, Rafael; Loeffler, Jurgen; Jurado, Manuel; Sainz, Juan","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db3824a1c673ce4d1bb41c065065598089c89578.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4982195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IA","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IA risk","decreased risk of IA","risk allele","risk of developing","non-IA","increased risk","IRF4 genes","rs12203592T","single-SNP analysis","significant overall associations","evidence of significant interactions","genetic markers","selected SNPs","stratified analysis","experiment-wide significant threshold","studied genes","opportunistic infection","C allele","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","major host genetic component","aspBIOmics consortium","NF\u03BAB2","HSCT","NF\u03BAB1","RelB","significance","RelA","Aspergillus","disease susceptibility","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","magnitude","collaborative effort","growing number of studies","haplotypic effect","European clinical institutions","genotype","high-risk patients","carriers","population","present airborne pathogenic mold","AATC","relevant impact","REC","GGTC","haplotypes","variant","Invasive Aspergillosis","large cohort","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

The distribution of MFE is central to many questions in evolutionary theory and is a key parameter in models of molecular evolution. Here we define the mutational fitness effects in influenza A virus by generating 128 viruses, each with a single nucleotide mutation. In contrast to mutational scanning approaches, this strategy allowed us to unambiguously assign fitness values to individual mutations. The presence of each desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations were verified by next generation sequencing of each stock. A mutation was considered lethal only after we failed to rescue virus in three independent transfections. We measured the fitness of each viable mutant relative to the wild type by quantitative RT-PCR following direct competition on A549 cells. We found that 31.6% of the mutations in the genome-wide dataset were lethal and that the lethal fraction did not differ appreciably between the HA- and NA-encoding segments and the rest of the genome. Of the viable mutants, the fitness mean and standard deviation were 0.80 and 0.22 in the genome-wide dataset and best modeled as a beta distribution. The fitness impact of mutation was marginally lower in the segments coding for HA and NA (0.88 \u00B1 0.16) than in the other 6 segments (0.78 \u00B1 0.24), and their respective beta distributions had slightly different shape parameters. The results for influenza A virus are remarkably similar to our own analysis of CirSeq-derived fitness values from poliovirus and previously published data from other small, single stranded DNA and RNA viruses. These data suggest that genome size, and not nucleic acid type or mode of replication, is the main determinant of viral mutational fitness effects.","publish_time":"2016-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Visher, Elisa; Whitefield, Shawn E.; McCrone, John T.; Fitzsimmons, William; Lauring, Adam S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3331c42f9b67fa096408f70ce02573e4b380a38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5003363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozgy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MFE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fitness impact of mutation","derived fitness values","main determinant of viral mutational fitness effects","mutational robustness","genome-wide dataset","genome size","desired mutation","distribution of MFE","mutational scanning approaches","single nucleotide mutation","influenza","individual mutations","segments coding","lethal fraction","absence of additional mutations","wild type","published data","RNA viruses","viable mutants","nucleic acid type","single stranded DNA","respective beta distributions","quantitative RT-PCR","key parameter","direct competition","poliovirus","mode of replication","analysis of CirSeq","evolutionary theory","different shape parameters","models of molecular evolution","A549 cells","questions","terms","strategy","strength","generation sequencing","contrast","rest","standard deviation","stock","independent transfections","presence","results"],"language":"en"},

Epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen, and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self-reactive (SR) immune cells, ultimately leading to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)-induced demyelination, this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells. In this model, immune-mediated demyelination is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control. However, their decline during persisting infection, despite ongoing demyelination, suggests an active control mechanism. Antigen-specific IL-10-secreting CD4(\u002B) T cells (Tr1) and Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cells (Tregs), both known to control autoimmunity and induced following JHMV infection, were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells. Ablation of Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4(\u002B) T cells within cervical lymph nodes (CLN), albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls. In contrast, infected IL-27 receptor deficient (IL-27R(\u2212/\u2212)) mice, characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells, revealed that SR CD4(\u002B) T cells in CLN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS. These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T-cell-mediated autoimmune pathology. The JHMV model is thus valuable to decipher tissue-specific mechanisms preventing autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Hinton, David R.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/376ac2d5c7446918fdc12ef89696687b8a2b23d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5030268.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5030268/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SR T","CNS","CLN","JHMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of SR T cells","regulatory T cells","immune cells","expansion of endogenous SR T cells","suppressive function of SR T cells","suppression of SR T-cell","distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells","increased SR CD4","CNS","drastic reduction of Tr1 cells","Antigen-specific IL","infected IL","induced demyelination","JHMV model","viral control","immune-mediated demyelination","ongoing demyelination","secreting CD4","tissue-specific mechanisms","Tregs","organ-specific autoimmune disease","following JHMV infection","autoimmune pathology","CLN","autoimmunity","draining lymph nodes","cervical lymph nodes","infected DEREG mice","triggers of autoimmune diseases","active control mechanism","cryptic antigen","bystander activation","mechanisms responsible","persisting infection","Ablation of Foxp3","Viral infections","advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","central nervous system","receptor deficient","multiple sclerosis","inflammatory demyelinating disorder","molecular mimicry","results","counteractive measures","host","Epitope","decline","study","contrast","numbers","controls"],"language":"en"},

These viral entities have attracted growing interest as optimal vaccine delivery vehicles. Phages are well-matched for vaccine design due to being highly stable under harsh environmental conditions, simple and inexpensive large scale production, and potent adjuvant capacities. Phage vaccines have efficient immunostimulatory effects and present a high safety profile because these viruses have made a constant relationship with the mammalian body during a long-standing evolutionary period. The birth of phage display technology has been a turning point in the development of phage-based vaccines. Phage display vaccines are made by expressing multiple copies of an antigen on the surface of immunogenic phage particles, thereby eliciting a powerful and effective immune response. Also, the ability to produce combinatorial peptide libraries with a highly diverse pool of randomized ligands has transformed phage display into a straightforward, versatile and high throughput screening methodology for the identification of potential vaccine candidates against different diseases in particular microbial infections. These libraries can be conveniently screened through an affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning against a wide variety of targets for the selection of mimotopes with high antigenicity and immunogenicity. Also, they can be panned against the antiserum of convalescent individuals to recognize novel peptidomimetics of pathogen-related epitopes.

The objective of the current work was to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of A (H7N9) patients in Guangzhou and explore possible reasons for the high fatality rate. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological information regarding A (H7N9) cases in Guangzhou was collected through review of medical records and field research. Data regarding clinical and laboratory features, treatment, and outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 84 % (21/25) had one or more underlying diseases. Fifteen patients (60.0 %) developed moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 14 (56 %) died of the ARDS or multiorgan failure. Patients with longer delay between onset of illness and initiation of oseltamivir treatment were more likely to develop ARDS. Elevated C-creative protein, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lymphocytopenia predicted a higher risk of developing ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of underlying diseases and clinical complications predicted poor clinical outcome. Early oseltamivir treatment was associated with a reduced risk of developing ARDS.","publish_time":"2016-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hui; Xiao, XinCai; Lu, Jianyun; Chen, Zongqiu; Li, Kuibiao; Liu, Hui; Luo, Lei; Wang, Ming; Yang, ZhiCong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de8f4493515bdf7ed934509024d19a66dc57016f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5048464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["patients","clinical complications","Guangzhou","H7N9","higher risk of developing ARDS","reduced risk of developing ARDS","poor clinical outcome","initiation of oseltamivir treatment","Early oseltamivir treatment","cases","presence of underlying diseases","high fatality rate","laboratory features","epidemiological information","epidemiological characteristics","aspartate aminotransferase","creatine kinase","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","lymphocytopenia","possible reasons","Elevated C-creative protein","review of medical records","field research","onset of illness","CONCLUSIONS","current work","case of influenza","outcomes","METHODS","Data","previous reports","objective","wave","multiorgan failure","BACKGROUND","epidemic","total","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During the RSV seasons in 2009-2015, we performed a retrospective review of data for 466 infants with CHD, examined at six centers in Korea. RESULTS: Infants received an average of 3.7\u00B11.9 (range, 1-10) injections during the RSV season. Fifty-seven HS-CHD patients (12.2%) were hospitalized with breakthrough RSV bronchiolitis, with a recurrence in three patients, one year after the initial check-up. Among patients with simple CHD, only five (1.1%) patients received one additional dose postoperatively, as per the limitations set by the Korean guideline.

Two filoviruses, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, result in a severe and often fatal infection in humans. However, bats are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. The molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. We report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death.

The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world and a little known about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. METHODS: The patients that were admitted and diagnosed with CCHF between April 2010 and September 2015 were examined. Patients\u2019 medical records were then evaluated retrospectively. Patients who underwent thorax CT evaluation based on the clinical findings at the time of admission and/or during the hospital stay were included in the study. Patients\u2019 laboratory test results and thorax CT findings for respiratory assessment along with demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Forty patients diagnosed with CCHF that underwent thorax CT based on their indications were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients (62.5 %) were male with a mean age of 55.22 \u00B1 19.84 years. According to these results, the three most common thorax CT findings were parenchymal infiltration [32 patients (80 %)], pleural effusion [31 patients (77.5 %)], and alveolar infiltration [28 patients (70 %)]. Moreover, we determined that the most frequently seen radiological findings often occurred bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: There is still not enough information regarding this life-threatening disease. We also would like to emphasize that both direct radiography and thorax CT are highly successful in detecting frequently encountered radiological findings such as pleural effusion, alveolar hemorrhage, and parenchymal infiltration that indicate pulmonary involvement.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akta\u015F, Turan; Akta\u015F, Fatma; \u00D6zmen, Zafer; Altunka\u015F, Ay\u015Feg\u00FCl; Kaya, Turan; Demir, Osman","journal":"Springerplus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96ff794b8411af6083cd7287f71e304d854b5087.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5074938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5074938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCHF patients","common thorax CT findings","pulmonary findings","radiological findings","thorax CT evaluation","clinical findings","parenchymal infiltration","alveolar infiltration","life-threatening disease","pleural effusion","study","Patients\u2019 laboratory test results","zoonotic viral disease","alveolar hemorrhage","pulmonary involvement","Patients\u2019 medical records","respiratory assessment","world","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever","wide geographical regions","PURPOSE","high mortality","demographic characteristics","time of admission","direct radiography","humans","mean age","male","indications","hospital stay","tick bites","years","agent","Nairovirus","information","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

To explore the role of CSF1 in steady-state control of monocyte production and differentiation and tissue repair, we previously developed a bioactive protein with a longer half-life in circulation by fusing pig CSF1 with the Fc region of pig IgG1a. CSF1-Fc administration to pigs expanded progenitor pools in the marrow and selectively increased monocyte numbers and their expression of the maturation marker CD163. There was a rapid increase in the size of the liver, and extensive proliferation of hepatocytes associated with increased macrophage infiltration. Despite the large influx of macrophages, there was no evidence of liver injury and no increase in circulating liver enzymes. Microarray expression profiling of livers identified increased expression of macrophage markers, i.e., cytokines such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 known to influence hepatocyte proliferation, alongside cell cycle genes. The analysis also revealed selective enrichment of genes associated with portal, as opposed to centrilobular regions, as seen in hepatic regeneration. Combined with earlier data from the mouse, this study supports the existence of a CSF1-dependent feedback loop, linking macrophages of the liver with bone marrow and blood monocytes, to mediate homeostatic control of the size of the liver.

Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were suggested to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trypsteen, Wim; Mohammadi, Pejman; Van Hecke, Clarissa; Mestdagh, Pieter; Lefever, Steve; Saeys, Yvan; De Bleser, Pieter; Vandesompele, Jo; Ciuffi, Angela; Vandekerckhove, Linos; De Spiegelaere, Ward","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44cbdded77107e8c97330deef77b1b761a9bb229.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9f13bcae6ae451b9a0c4d2f22c6557fcfbc2c3f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5080576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5080576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV pathogenesis","HIV-host interplay","primary HIV infection","effects of HIV infection","different HIV replication cycle processes","lncRNA expression","possible cis regulatory lncRNAs","transcription factor","host transcriptome","nearby mRNA expression","protein coding mRNAs","mRNA involvement","reverse transcription","lncRNA-mRNA pairs","co-expression analysis","protein-coding genes","cell cycle regulation","long non-coding RNAs","transcriptome profiling","distinct transcriptional regulation profile","DNA damage responses","apoptosis","ubiquitination pathways","field of RNA sequencing","extensive additional layer","integration","proteasomal","association","new dimension","cell\u2019s molecular network","mechanisms","particle production","recent advances","biological roles","function","present study","guilt","targets"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in our region, in children and adults with a pre-diagnosis of ARTI. METHODS: A total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart 22 kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 612 (72.4%) of the specimens. Overall, 902 pathogens were detected; 821 (91%) were viruses and 81 (9%) were bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza A virus (IFV-A) (n = 219), influenza B virus (IFV-B) (n=157), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 107), human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 91), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B (n = 64), adenovirus (n = 56), human coronaviruses (n = 51), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 49), parainfluenza viruses (n = 40), human metapneumovirus (n = 36), Bordetella pertussis (n = 15), Legionella pneumophila (n = 11), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (n = 6), respectively. Among the 215 (25.4%) co-infected cases, IFV-A/HBoV and IFV-A/IFV-B were the most common co-infections. IFV-A was the most prevalent agent in all age groups except for children under 5 years of age, in whom RSV A/B was the most common pathogen. Approximately two thirds of the respiratory viruses were detected in early spring and winter, with peaks in January, March, and April. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses, our epidemiological data for the 2014 - 2015 season in Istanbul showed a predominance of IFV-A infections with a peak activity in early spring. Enhanced surveillance and early detection of respiratory viral pathogens can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ARTIs, and for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.","publish_time":"2016-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goktas, Safak; Sirin, Mumtaz Cem","journal":"Jundishapur J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4510e8bc12acbeaa9fc8dd88429b14c02ed6ab1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5086027.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5086027/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["ARTI","RSV A/B"],"locations":["Netherlands","Istanbul"],"keyphrases":["IFV-B","predominance of IFV","seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses","detected pathogens","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza B virus","parainfluenza viruses","common infections","early detection of respiratory viral pathogens","common co-infections","early spring","common pathogen","Acute respiratory tract infection","prevalence","children","RSV","HBoV","human bocavirus","human coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","pre-diagnosis of ARTI","age groups","years of age","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","nasopharyngeal swab specimens","co-infected cases","Rotor-Gene","PathoFinder BV","RespiFinder Smart","Netherlands","kit","adults","region","Enhanced surveillance","peak activity","development of appropriate public health strategies","real-time PCR system","total","treatment","BACKGROUND","prevalent agent","regard","significant morbidity","epidemiological data","prevention of ARTIs","Istanbul","winter","peaks","rhinovirus","Bordetella pertussis","Legionella pneumophila","METHODS","mortality","study","CONCLUSIONS","enterovirus","thirds","adenovirus","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications. METHODS: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9 months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and \u2013negative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the \u201CImmune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT\u201D and the \u201CInflammation_Interferon signaling\u201D were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects.

The purpose of the present study was to assess and compare the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in nursing home (NH) residents and staff, to identify viruses involved in ARI and to correlate viral etiology with clinical manifestations of ARI. METHODS: The prospective surveillance study was accomplished in a medium-sized NH in Slovenia (central Europe). Ninety NH residents and 42 NH staff were included. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all participants at enrollment (December 5th, 2011) and at the end of the study (May 31st, 2012), and from each participant that developed ARI within this timeframe. Molecular detection of 15 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed. RESULTS: The weekly incidence rate of ARI in NH residents and NH staff correlated; however, it was higher in staff members than in residents (5.9 versus 3.8/1,000 person-days, P = 0.03), and was 2.5 (95 % CI: 1.36\u20134.72) times greater in residents without dementia than in residents with dementia. Staff members typically presented with upper respiratory tract involvement, whereas in residents lower respiratory tract infections predominated. Respiratory viruses were detected in 55/100 ARI episodes. In residents, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were detected most commonly, whereas in NH staff rhinovirus and influenza A virus prevailed. 38/100 ARI episodes (30/56 in residents, 8/44 in staff) belonged to one of three outbreaks (caused by human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: ARI are common among NH residents and staff, and viruses were detected in a majority of the episodes of ARI. Many ARI episodes among NH residents were outbreak cases and could be considered preventable.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of inosine pranobex versus placebo in subjects with clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness, including subjects with laboratory-confirmed acute respiratory viral infections. Subgroup analyses evaluated the efficacy of inosine pranobex compared to placebo in otherwise healthy (without related ongoing disease) subjects that were less than 50 years of age and healthy subjects that were at least 50 years of age. The effect of body mass index (BMI) was evaluated in subjects less than 50 years of age. METHODS: A total of 463 subjects were randomly assigned to receive inosine pranobex (n = 231) or placebo (n = 232) in this Phase 4, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to resolution of all influenza-like symptoms present at baseline to none. Safety was evaluated through analysis of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examinations. RESULTS: The difference in time to resolution of all influenza-like symptoms between treatment groups was not statistically significant but showed a faster improvement in subjects in the inosine pranobex group versus those in the placebo group - Hazard Ratio = 1.175; (95 % CI: 0.806\u20131.714). P-value = 0.324. In the subgroup analysis for subjects less than 50 years of age, statistically significant differences in time to resolution of influenza-like symptoms that favoured the inosine pranobex group over the placebo group were observed in those without related ongoing disease and those who were non-obese (BMI \u003C30 kg/m(2)). The differences between the inosine pranobex and placebo groups in subjects at least 50 years of age without related ongoing disease and in subjects less than 50 years of age who were obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m(2)) were not statistically significant. Inosine pranobex was generally well tolerated, and no deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate the safety of inosine pranobex for the treatment of subjects with confirmed acute respiratory viral infections and confirm the efficacy of inosine pranobex versus placebo in healthy non-obese subjects less than 50 years of age with clinically diagnosed influenza-like illnesses.

Recently developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses. In this study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice. We show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die 5\u20136 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that subside gradually over 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models. However, whereas IFNAR KO mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1, IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly of T cells, particularly CD8\u002B T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB and Prf1 at peak of disease. Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurodegeneration predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the disease in that model. The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible therapeutics and vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manangeeswaran, Mohanraj; Ireland, Derek D.

This, together with the emergence of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016, has again highlighted the potential for disease to spread across international borders and provided an impetus for countries to review their Port Health preparedness. This report reviews the legislative framework and actions taken under this framework in advancing and improving Port Health preparedness in Ireland, in response to the declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Ebola Virus Disease in August 2014. FINDINGS: Infectious disease Shipping and Aircraft Regulations were brought into force in Ireland in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Preparatory actions taken under these and the International Health Regulations necessitated significant levels of cross disciplinary working with other organisations, both within and beyond traditional healthcare settings. Information packs on Ebola Virus Disease were prepared and distributed to airports, airlines, port authorities and shipping agents, and practical exercises were held at relevant sites. Agreements were put in place for contact tracing of passenger and crew on affected conveyances and protocols were established for the management of Medical Declarations of Health from ships coming from West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa resulted in significant strengthening of Ireland\u2019s Port Health preparedness, while also highlighting the extent to which preparedness requires ongoing and sustained commitment from all stakeholders, both nationally and internationally, in ensuring that countries are ready when the next threat presents at their borders.","publish_time":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glynn, R.

Criticism of WHO\u2019s performance grew louder in the outbreak\u2019s wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies. DISCUSSION: In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO\u2019s performance post-Ebola. Collectively, these recommendations add increasing complexity to the urgent need for WHO reform, a process that the agency must carry out in order to maintain its legitimacy. Proposals that garnered strong support included the formation of an independent WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, the urgent need to increase WHO infectious disease funding and capacity, and establishing better operational and policy coordination between WHO, UN agencies, and other global health partners. The recommendations also raise more fundamental questions about restructuring the global health architecture, and whether the UN should play a more active role in global health governance. SUMMARY: Despite the need for a fully modernized WHO, reform proposals recently announced by WHO fail to achieve the \u201Cevolution\u201D in global health governance needed in order to ensure that global society is adequately protected against the multifaceted and increasingly complex nature of modern public health emergencies. Instead, the lasting legacy of the EVD outbreak may be its foreshadowing of a governance \u201Cshift\u201D in formal sharing of the complex responsibilities of global health, health security, outbreak response, and managing health emergencies to other international structures, most notably the United Nations. Only time will tell if the legacy of EVD will include a WHO that has the full support of the international community and is capable of leading human society in this brave new era of the globalization of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackey, Tim K.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/784b8019936ae21771682f1184ff3fe10cc40b6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5121963.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121963/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","United Nations","EVD","UN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health governance","century global health","global health partners","global health architecture","health security","complex responsibilities of global health","future of global public health","global society","World Health Organization","governance reform","international health UN-specialized agency","complex nature of modern public health emergencies","EVD outbreak","infectious disease governance","outbreak response","international community","complex series of reform recommendations","legacy of EVD","reform proposals","order","Ebola virus disease outbreak","international structures","urgent need","infectious disease funding","performance post-Ebola","United Nations","globalization of infectious diseases","future landscape","broader role","series of reports","debate article","active role","strong support","lasting legacy","post-endemic phase","subject of continued debate","capable of leading human society","transitions","brave new era","difficult position","impact","Emergency Preparedness","formal sharing","Centre","capacity","agencies","outbreak\u2019s wake","fundamental questions","policy coordination","formation","shift","increasing complexity","foreshadowing","implications","high-level commissions","panels","different stakeholders","process","evolution","BACKGROUND","Decisions","Criticism","time","DISCUSSION","legitimacy","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

Bacterial genomes and proteins are detected in brains from humans, nonhuman primates, rodents and other species in the absence of neurological disease. We investigated the composition and abundance of microbiota in frozen and fixed autopsied brain samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched nonMS patients as controls, using neuropathological, molecular and bioinformatics tools. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed Proteobacteria to be the dominant phylum with restricted diversity in cerebral white matter (WM) from MS compared to nonMS patients. Both clinical groups displayed 1,200\u20131,400 bacterial genomes/cm(3) and low bacterial rRNA:rDNA ratios in WM. RNAseq analyses showed a predominance of Proteobacteria in progressive MS patients\u2019 WM, associated with increased inflammatory gene expression, relative to a broader range of bacterial phyla in relapsing-remitting MS patients\u2019 WM. Although bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivities were observed in all patients, PGN immunodetection was correlated with demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS brains.

IDO expression by LN pDCs was closely dependent on MHCII-mediated, antigen-dependent, interactions with Treg. We further established that IDO production by pDCs was necessary to confer suppressive function to Tregs. During EAE development, IDO expression by pDCs was required for the generation of Tregs capable of dampening the priming of encephalitogenic T cell and disease severity. Thus, we describe a novel crosstalk between pDCs and Tregs: Tregs shape tolerogenic functions of pDCs prior to inflammation, such that pDCs in turn, promote Treg suppressive functions during autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lippens, Carla; Duraes, Fernanda V.; Dubrot, Juan; Brighouse, Dale; Lacroix, Mathilde; Irla, Magali; Aubry-Lachainaye, Jean-Pierre; Reith, Walter; Mandl, Judith N.; Hugues, St\u00E9phanie","journal":"J Autoimmun","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5127883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LN pDCs","Tregs shape tolerogenic functions of pDCs","IDO expression","IDO production","Treg suppressive functions","generation of Tregs capable","autoimmunity","antigen-dependent","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells","inflammation","priming of encephalitogenic T cell","steady-state lymph nodes","MHCII","turn","disease severity","major expressors of Indoleamine","LNs","dioxygenase","regulation","EAE development","novel crosstalk","interactions"],"language":"en"},

Neutrophils play a central role in the host defense against bacteria and thereby pathogenesis of infections. While there are numerous studies about neutrophil function after trauma, data about their biology in patients who suffer from pneumonia following trauma are sparse. Here, we studied the effect of serum isolated from patients who do and do not develop infection (inf.) on the biology of neutrophils from healthy volunteers. METHODS: Sera samples from eighteen TP with an injury severity score above 16 were obtained. Nine patients were grouped to no inf. group (TP without pneumonia), and nine to inf. group (TP with pneumonia). Samples were obtained at admission to emergency department (ED), a day prior pneumonia diagnosis (1 d prior inf) or at the day of diagnosis (1 d prior inf). Samples from the equal post-injury days in the corresponding no inf. group were used. Neutrophils from nine healthy volunteers were isolated. Effects for sera isolated from infected and non-infected patients on neutrophil biology were analyzed. Migratory capacity of neutrophils towards TP\u2019s serum, their CD11b and CD62L membrane receptor expression and oxidative burst activity after stimulation with TP\u2019s serum were determined and compared between groups. RESULTS: Migratory capacity of neutrophils was significantly increased after trauma and persisted during the study period. CD11b expression in all groups was significantly increased. CD62L expression decreased generally in samples from ED and recovered later to baseline. Stratifying no inf. and inf. groups showed significantly decreased migratory capacity, increased CD11b and significantly decreased CD62L expression in the no inf. group. These differences persisted during the complete observational period. ROS production was strongly reduced in the no inf. group compared to the inf. group at later experimental time points. CONCLUSIONS: This data indicate that patients at risk for pneumonia development have differentially and early activated neutrophils following trauma compared to patients who are not at risk for post-injury complication. Studies about the differential biology of neutrophils and their immediately after trauma modified activity depending on the post-injury clinical course are warranted, and may deliver predictive or even therapeutic strategies to control inflammation.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Relja, B.; Taraki, R.; Teuben, M.

These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. METHODS: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. RESULTS: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual\u2019s internet activity. CONCLUSION: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.

Reducing pandemic-related stress may best be accomplished through interventions designed to enhance resilience in psychologically healthy people. Applicable models to improve adaptation in individuals include Folkman and Greer\u2019s framework for stress appraisal and coping along with psychological first aid. Resilience is supported at an organizational level by effective training and support, development of material and relational reserves, effective leadership, the effects of the characteristics of \u201Cmagnet hospitals,\u201D and a culture of organizational justice. Evidence supports the goal of developing and maintaining an organizational culture of resilience in order to reduce the expected stress of an influenza pandemic on healthcare workers. This recommendation goes well beyond the provision of adequate training and counseling.

Proteomics is increasingly being used to study the biomarkers of infectious diseases. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics and liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry were used to analyze the fold change of protein expression in plasma of children with MP pneumonia (MPP), infectious disease control (IDC), and healthy control (HC) groups. Selected proteins that can distinguish MPP from HC and IDC were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: After multivariate analyses, 27 potential plasma biomarkers were identified to be expressed differently among child MPP, HC, and IDC groups. Among these proteins, SERPINA3, APOC1, ANXA6, KNTC1, and CFLAR were selected for ELISA verification. SERPINA3, APOC1, and CFLAR levels were significantly different among the three groups and the ratios were consistent with the trends of proteomics results. A comparison of MPP patients and HC showed APOC1 had the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853, with 77.6% sensitivity and 81.1% specificity. When APOC1 levels were compared between MPP and IDC patients, it also showed a relatively high AUC of 0.882, with 77.6% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity. Conclusion: APOC1 is a potential biomarker for the rapid and noninvasive diagnosis of MPP in children.

Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1\u03B2 (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","publish_time":"2016-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Min; Dai, Manman; Cao, Weisheng; Tan, Yan; Li, Zhenhui; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4bffc76026b935fe454f98878510ab490e75bff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5161024.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALV-J infection","h post infection","ALV-J immune escape","infected MDM cells","lifelong infection","IL","host immune defenses","late infection stage","early infection stage","immune attack","host innate immunity","IFN-\u03B2","MDM phagocytic capacity","Avian leucosis virus subgroup J","innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages","macrophages act","production","expression of Mx","hpi","protein level of interleukin","ISG12","results","protein levels of interferon","important role","expression levels of Myxovirus resistance","important defense line","invading pathogens","function","viral growth rate","nitric oxide","effect","little change","chickens","study","DF"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the pathogenesis mechanism and the virus-host interaction during infection with both PEDV YN13 and YN144 strains, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to investigate the proteomic changes produced in the primary target organ, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 269 and 301 differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the jejunum tissues of the piglets inoculated with YN13 and YN144, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in stress responses, signal transduction, and the immune system. All of these involved interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which were up-regulated in jejunums by both of the PEDV-infected groups.

We previously reported that co-ligation of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) by antibody-opsonized DENV led to recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and reduce interferon stimulated gene induction.

Reduced or slower trafficking of antibody-opsonized DENV to lytic phagolysosomal compartments, demonstrates how co-ligation of LILRB1 also permits DENV to overcome a cell-autonomous immune response, enhancing intracellular survival of DENV.

In raw sewage human waste is mixed with household, industrial and drainage water, and virus particles are, therefore, only found in low concentrations. This necessitates a step of sample concentration to allow for sensitive virus detection. Additionally, viruses harbor a large diversity of both surface and genome structures, which makes universal viral genomic extraction difficult. Current studies have tackled these challenges in many different ways employing a wide range of viral concentration and extraction procedures. However, there is limited knowledge of the efficacy and inherent biases associated with these methods in respect to viral sewage metagenomics, hampering the development of this field. By the use of next generation sequencing this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of four commonly applied viral concentrations techniques (precipitation with polyethylene glycol, organic flocculation with skim milk, monolithic adsorption filtration and glass wool filtration) and extraction methods (Nucleospin RNA XS, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, NucliSENS(\u00AE) miniMAG(\u00AE), or PowerViral(\u00AE) Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit) to determine the viriome in a sewage sample. We found a significant influence of concentration and extraction protocols on the detected viriome. The viral richness was largest in samples extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or PowerViral(\u00AE) Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit. Highest viral specificity were found in samples concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol or extracted with Nucleospin RNA XS. Detection of viral pathogens depended on the method used. These results contribute to the understanding of method associated biases, within the field of viral sewage metagenomics, making evaluation of the current literature easier and helping with the design of future studies.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hjelms\u00F8, Mathis Hjort; Hellm\u00E9r, Maria; Fernandez-Cassi, Xavier; Timoneda, Nat\u00E0lia; Lukjancenko, Oksana; Seidel, Michael; Els\u00E4sser, Dennis; Aarestrup, Frank M.; L\u00F6fstr\u00F6m, Charlotta; Bofill-Mas, S\u00EDlvia; Abril, Josep F.; Girones, Rosina; Schultz, Anna Charlotte","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b5ea760c63aaff964de32541643d92c69dfc05e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5242460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nucleospin RNA XS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral richness","field of viral sewage metagenomics","QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit","Detection of viral pathogens","Highest viral specificity","Environmental RNA","wide range of viral concentration","applied viral concentrations techniques","universal viral genomic extraction difficult","sewage sample","Nucleospin RNA XS","extraction methods","DNA Isolation Kit","extraction protocols","extraction procedures","Current studies","raw sewage human waste","polyethylene glycol","samples","precipitation","PowerViral","novel field of study","step of sample concentration","epidemiological studies","evaluation of waste water treatment efficiency","significant influence of concentration","sensitive virus detection","design of future studies","drainage water","inherent biases","virus particles","detected viriome","understanding of method","low concentrations","monolithic adsorption filtration","glass wool filtration","current literature easier","skim milk","organic flocculation","genome structures","household","surveillance","NucliSENS","respect","large diversity","different ways","surface","efficacy","challenges","development","limited knowledge","miniMAG","viruses","results","generation"],"language":"en"},

We developed prototype subunit and adenoviral-based Zika vaccines encoding the extracellular portion of the ZIKV envelope gene (E) fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (Efl). The subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array (MNA). The immunogenicity of these two vaccines, named Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and ZIKV-rEfl, was tested in C57BL/6 mice. Prime/boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a ZIKV-specific antibody response, which provided neutralizing immunity. Moreover, protection was evaluated in seven-day-old pups after virulent ZIKV intraperitoneal challenge. Pups born to mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl were all protected against lethal challenge infection without weight loss or neurological signs, while pups born to dams immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl were partially protected (50%). No protection was seen in pups born to phosphate buffered saline-immunized mice.

Functional characterisation revealed that DendoU is essential for Drosophila viability and nervous system activity. Pan-neuronal silencing of dendoU resulted in fly immature phenotypes, highly reduced lifespan and dramatic motor performance defects.

Rotavirus is a major etiological agent of childhood diarrhea in developing countries, where malnutrition is prevalent. However, the interactions between the two and their combined effects on immune and intestinal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we used neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs transplanted with the fecal microbiota of a healthy 2-month-old infant (HIFM) and fed protein-deficient or -sufficient bovine milk diets. Protein deficiency induced hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, stunting, and generalized edema in Gn pigs, as observed in protein-malnourished children. Irrespective of the diet, human rotavirus (HRV) infection early, at HIFM posttransplantation day 3 (PTD3), resulted in adverse health effects and higher mortality rates (45 to 75%) than later HRV infection (PTD10). Protein malnutrition exacerbated HRV infection and affected the morphology and function of the small intestinal epithelial barrier. In pigs infected with HRV at PTD10, there was a uniform decrease in the function and/or frequencies of natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and CD103(\u002B) and apoptotic mononuclear cells and altered gene expression profiles of intestinal epithelial cells (chromogranin A, mucin 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, SRY-Box 9, and villin).

Importantly, the understanding of P. ovale\u2014nowadays regarded as the two distinct species P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi\u2014largely stems from case reports and case series lacking study designs providing high quality evidence. Consecutively, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the clinical presentation, appropriate treatment and relapse characteristics of P. ovale malaria. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a systematic appraisal of the current evidence for severe manifestations, relapse characteristics and treatment options for human P. ovale malaria. METHODS AND RESULTS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the international prospective register for systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016039214). P. ovale mono-infection was a strict inclusion criterion. Of 3454 articles identified by the literature search, 33 articles published between 1922 and 2015 met the inclusion criteria. These articles did not include randomized controlled trials. Five prospective uncontrolled clinical trials were performed on a total of 58 participants. P. ovale was sensitive to all tested drugs within the follow-up periods and on interpretable in vitro assays. Since its first description in 1922, only 18 relapsing cases of P. ovale with a total of 28 relapse events were identified in the scientific literature. There was however no molecular evidence for a causal relationship between dormant liver stages and subsequent relapses. A total of 22 severe cases of P. ovale malaria were published out of which five were fatal. Additionally, two cases of congenital P. ovale malaria were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge of P. ovale malaria is based on small trials with minor impact, case reports and clinical observations. This systematic review highlights that P. ovale is capable of causing severe disease, severe congenital malaria and may even lead to death. Evidence for relapses in patients with P. ovale malaria adds up to only a handful of cases. Nearly 100 years after P. ovale\u2019s first description by Stephens the evidence for the clinical characteristics, relapse potential and optimal treatments for P. ovale malaria is still scarce.

Additionally, endemic zoonoses, such as rabies, burden countries year after year, placing demands on limited finances and personnel. To survey the baseline status of the emerging and endemic zoonoses programmes of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted a survey of priority emerging and endemic zoonoses, countries\u00B4 prioritization criteria and methodologies, and suggestions to strengthen countries capacities and regional approaches to zoonoses control. METHODS: A fillable online questionnaire was sent to the zoonoses programme managers of the Ministries of Health (MOH) and Ministries of Agriculture (MAg) of 33 LAC countries from January to April of 2015. The questionnaire comprised 36 single, multiple choice and open-ended questions to inform the objectives of the survey. A descriptive exploratory analysis was completed. RESULTS: Fifty-four ministries (26 MOH, 25 MAg, and 3 combined responses) in 31 LAC countries responded to the survey. Within the ministries, 22 (85%) MOH, 5 (20%) MAg, and 2 (67%) combined entities indicated they had specialized zoonoses units. For endemic zoonoses, 32 of 54 ministries responded that they conduct formal prioritization exercises, most of them annually (69%). The three priority endemic zoonoses for the MOHs were leptospirosis, rabies, and brucellosis while the three priorities for the MAgs were brucellosis, rabies, and tuberculosis. Diagnosis for rabies and leptospirosis were cited as the capacities most in need of development. The most needed cross-cutting capacity was coordination between stakeholders. For emerging zoonoses, 28 ministries performed formal prioritization exercises. The top prioritization criteria were probability of introduction into the country and impact. The three priority emerging zoonoses for the MOHs were Ebola viral disease, avian influenza, and Chikungunya while for the MAgs were avian influenza, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and West Nile virus disease. Surveillance for avian influenza and Ebola, and diagnosis for BSE were quoted as the capacities most needed. For all zoonoses, the majority of respondents (69%) ranked their relationship with the other Ministry as productive or very productive, and 31% minimally productive. Many countries requested a formal regional network, better regional communication and collaboration, and integrated surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The survey is the first comprehensive effort to date to inform the status of zoonoses programmes in LAC. The information collected here will be used to develop a regional strategy for zoonoses (both endemic and emerging), increase efforts, advocacy, and promote prompt identification and management of EIDs and improvement of endemic programmes.","publish_time":"2017-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maxwell, Melody J.; Freire de Carvalho, Mary H.; Hoet, Armando E.; Vigilato, Marco A.

The outbreak was initially confined to Wuhan City, but then spread outside Chinese borders. On 31 January 2020, the first case was declared in Spain. On 11 March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. On 16 March 2020, there were 139 countries affected. In this situation, the Scientific Societies SEMICYUC and SEEIUC have decided to draw up this Contingency Plan to guide the response of the Intensive Care Services. The objectives of this plan are to estimate the magnitude of the problem and identify the necessary human and material resources.

The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"qiu, t.; Xiao, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/112a52667f92d8936fababa4b0c9001d3686b043.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.10.20032995v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIO"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","South Korea","Japan","Iran","United States"],"keyphrases":["epidemic","city of Wuhan","total number of infected people","SARS-CoV","Model parameters","population of Wuhan","days","lockdown","multiple public health policies","public gathering events","new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO","Multiple countries","global public health threat","total infections","outbreak of SARS","influence of national public health policies","multiple temporary hospitals","status Susceptible","number of beds","fitted parameters","peak point","control","study","basic reproduction number R","daily report of new infections","exposed ones","peak time","end point","Japan","locking","South Korea","Italy","Iran","MH","bed numbers","United States","transmission parameter","nations","world fighting","Methods","different conditions","single day","diminishing return","infection scale","useful guidance","Chinese government","symptoms","times","investment","similar situations","Interpretation","Medical care","system","current situation","patient","delay","China"],"language":"en"},

Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by 19 bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions, and back to the Tropics again. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia, and later return to areas of Southeastern Asia, in a manner similar to that of influenza strains (H3N2). Our approach may therefore be of value for the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an optimistic scenario of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks, like other viral respiratory diseases.

Methods In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax\u00AE Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. Results In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. Discussion The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial.

COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein. Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a(\u002B) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study. However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nazneen Akhand, Mst Rubaiat; Azim, Kazi Faizul; Hoque, Syeda Farjana; Moli, Mahmuda Akther; Joy, Bijit Das; Akter, Hafsa; Afif, Ibrahim Khalil; Ahmed, Nadim; Hasan, Mahmudul","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/323f417a74c9a82ec74c360eb64d7cf8fe1ba36c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Normal Mode"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","envelope protein","membrane protein","nucleocapsid protein","COVID","molecular level","present study","Molecular docking study","superiority of construct V3","close ancestral relation of SARS","silico study","homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein","Essential molecular dynamics","allergenicity pattern","conservancy level","model animals","T cell","refined model","approved vaccine","novel multiepitope subunit vaccine","B cell","basis of antigenicity","translational efficacy","putative epitopes","designed constructs","Normal Mode analysis","establishment of ancestral relationship","population coverage analysis","major structural proteins","novel chimeric vaccines","different strains of coronaviruses","Numerous immunogenic epitopes","different host receptors","toxicity","high binding affinity","minimal deformability","transmembrane topology","uncertainty","implementation","wet lab trials","linkers","physicochemical properties","HLA cells","terms safety","solubility","unprecedented threat","appropriate adjuvants","thousands of regular death scenes","vector of","global healthcare system","hepatic systems of human","recovery of COVI","Unavailability of specific therapeutics","genome","Conserved regions","serious public condition","infections","Microbial expression","development of preventive measures","coli strain K12","world","multiple sequence alignment","disulfide engineering","presented data","bat coronavirus","addition","phylogeny analyses","validation","pET28a","stability","common fragments"],"language":"en"},

We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach in human haploid cells to identify host factors crucial for vaccinia virus infection. A library of mutagenized HAP1 cells was exposed to Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA). Deep-sequencing analysis of virus-resistant cells identified host factors involved in heparan sulfate synthesis, Golgi organization, and vesicular protein trafficking. We validated EXT1, TM9SF2 and TMED10 (TMP21/p23/p24\u03B4) as important host factors for vaccinia virus infection. The critical role of EXT1 in heparan sulfate synthesis and vaccinia virus infection was confirmed. TM9SF2 was validated as a player mediating heparan sulfate expression, explaining its contribution to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, TMED10 was found to be crucial for virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis, suggesting that TMED10 regulates actin cytoskeleton remodelling necessary for virus infection. Importance Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of host species. A number of these viruses are clinically important to humans, including variola virus (smallpox) and vaccinia virus. Since the eradication of smallpox, zoonotic infections with monkeypox virus and cowpox virus are emerging. Additionally, poxviruses can be engineered to specifically target cancer cells, and are used as vaccine vector against tuberculosis, influenza, and coronaviruses. Poxviruses rely on host factors for most stages of their life cycle, including attachment to the cell and entry. These host factors are crucial for virus infectivity and host cell tropism. We used a genome-wide knock-out library of host cells to identify host factors necessary for vaccinia virus infection. We confirm a dominant role for heparin sulfate in mediating virus attachment. Additionally, we show that TMED10, previously not implicated in virus infections, modulates the host cell membrane to facilitate virus uptake.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luteijn, Rutger D.; van Diemen, Ferdy; Blomen, Vincent A.; Boer, Ingrid G.J.; Sadasivam, Saran Manikam; van Kuppevelt, Toin H.; Drexler, Ingo; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.; Lebbink, Robert Jan; Wiertz, Emmanuel J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fba26a85cc21b600807d523b4f94b646918e21b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/493205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinia virus infection","virus infections","virus infectivity","monkeypox virus","cowpox virus","variola virus","virus uptake","mediating virus attachment","Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara","host factors crucial","important host factors","host factors necessary","library of host cells","host cell membrane","host cell tropism","Deep-sequencing analysis of virus","virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing","wide range of host species","TMED10","study poxvirus-host cell interactions","heparan sulfate synthesis","resistant cells","cancer cells","heparin sulfate","human haploid cells","library of mutagenized HAP1 cells","player mediating heparan sulfate expression","genome-wide knock","TM9SF2","Importance Poxviruses","critical role of EXT1","genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach","zoonotic infections","vaccine vector","dominant role","eradication of smallpox","promising viral vaccine","phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis","large DNA viruses","Golgi organization","p23","p24\u03B4","contribution","actin cytoskeleton","gene delivery candidate","TMP21","humans","vesicular protein trafficking","tuberculosis","influenza","life cycle","model","stages","MVA","coronaviruses","number","entry","addition"],"language":"en"},

In mammals, TOR specifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids are available to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translation downstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored in plants. Here, we took parallel global profiling approaches to define the in planta TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on the canonical 5\u2032 oligopyrimidine tract motif (5\u2032TOP) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. To investigate this further, we focused on a putative TOR substrate identified in our phosphoproteome: LARP1, a eukaryotic RNA-binding protein that is proposed to mediate TOR translational control of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in humans and that has gained increased interest because it associates with SARS-CoV-2. By conducting parallel global profiling experiments with larp1 mutants, we discovered that the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis controls 5\u2032TOP mRNA translation in plants and defined a set of conserved eukaryotic 5\u2032TOP mRNAs that encode cyclins, importins/karyopherins, translation elongation factors, and TCTP1, among others. We then identified novel, plant-specific 5\u2032TOP mRNAs involved in critical biological processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and auxin signaling. Our study illuminates the ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1 in eukaryotic cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scarpin, M.

We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response (\u226530 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values \u003C .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65\u002B) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk.

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaoqiang; Tian, Weitian; Lv, Xin; Shi, Yumiao; Zhou, Xiaoxin; Yu, Weifeng; Su, Diansan; Tian, Jie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ac5a0ee56faec83900d1f9da203abb11c7e3110.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Speedmax"],"keyphrases":["Chinese strategies","Speedmax of different areas","mainland China","number of plateaus","diffusion","series of strategies","deterioration of COVID","spread of COVID","number of new cases","speed of infections","Hubei Province","growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients","strategies supply experience","strict intervention strategies","provincial Health Commission websites of China","different times","Chinese government","data of cumulative confirmed cases","public health","quartic model","model fitting","outbreak of new type of coronavirus","short time","novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","Hebei","Heilongjiang","Hainan","little influence","exceptions","Guizhou","countries","guidelines","Wuhan","days","best fit","economic development","study","maximum","dates","Results","Methods","Conclusion","distance","effects","disease","emigration index","epidemic","Background"],"language":"en"},

The first of these macrodomains, termed Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, binds to mono- and poly-ADP-ribose, and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating this domain as a prominent virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose refined at 2.2 \u00C5 resolution. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and ADP-ribose binding modes as shown by structural comparison. All three CoV Mac1 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low \u03BCM affinities. They also demonstrated highly efficient de-MARylating activity, which was greater than that of the human Mdo2 macrodomain. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are highly efficient ADP-ribosylhydrolases with strikingly similar activity, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad antiviral activity against CoVs. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused nearly 300K deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose, a post-translation modification, from proteins. This protein domain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins, and a human macrodomain. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alhammad, Yousef M.O.; Kashipathy, Maithri M.; Roy, Anuradha; Johnson, David K.; McDonald, Peter; Battaile, Kevin P.; Gao, Philip; Lovell, Scott; Fehr, Anthony R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4557e33466208de84ef649ff8bbc23b0eb569fd4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.089375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV pathogenesis","MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins","IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV","mono-ADP","termed Mac1","poly-ADP","ADP-ribose binding modes","target proteins","antiviral ADP-ribosylation","efficient ADP-ribosylhydrolases","crystal structure of SARS","multiple animal models of CoV infection","Mac1 likely counters host","similar activity","CoVs","human macrodomain","potential therapeutic target","novel therapeutic target","enzyme activity","conserved macrodomain","broad antiviral activity","unique protein domain","human Mdo2 macrodomain","structural comparison","efficient de-MARylating activity","non-structural protein","novel therapeutic strategies","complex","human population","similar structural folds","direct comparison","host response","posttranslational modification","tandem macrodomains","testing of potential therapies","post-translation modification","worldwide pandemic of COVID","hydrolysis activities","prominent virulence factor","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","design","compounds","steps","approved treatments","low \u03BCM affinities","viral infections","biochemistry","nsp3","\u00C5 resolution","results","efforts","coronaviruses","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Especially challenging in places with sparse healthcare, limited diagnostic capacity, and public health infrastructure, syndromes with overlapping febrile presentations easily evade early detection. There is a clear need for evidence-based and context-dependent tools to make syndromic surveillance more efficient. Using published data on symptom presentation and incidence of 21 febrile syndromes, we develop a novel algorithm for aetiological identification of case clusters and demonstrate its ability to identify outbreaks of dengue, malaria, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease based on clinical data from past outbreaks. We then apply the same algorithm to simulated outbreaks to systematically estimate the syndromic detectability of outbreaks of all 21 syndromes. We show that while most rare haemorrhagic fevers are clinically distinct from most endemic fevers in sub-Saharan Africa, VHF detectability is limited even under conditions of perfect syndromic surveillance. Furthermore, even large clusters (20\u002B cases) of filoviral diseases cannot be routinely distinguished by the clinical criteria present in their case definitions alone; we show that simple syndromic case definitions are insensitive to rare fevers across most of the region. We map the estimated detectability of Ebola virus disease across sub-Saharan Africa, based on geospatially mapped estimates of malaria, dengue, and other fevers with overlapping syndromes. We demonstrate \u0022hidden hotspots\u0022 where Ebola virus is likely to spill over from wildlife and also transmit undetected for many cases. Such places may represent both the locations of past unobserved outbreaks and potential future origins for larger epidemics. Finally, we consider the implications of these results for improved locally relevant syndromic surveillance and the consequences of syndemics and under-resourced health infrastructure for infectious disease emergence.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glennon, Emma E; Jephcott, Freya L; Oti, Alexandra; Carlson, Colin J; Bustos Carillo, Fausto A; Hranac, C Reed; Parker, Edyth; Wood, James L N; Restif, Olivier","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27a3cca0f970a1498cd8ea7dea67ca5ca5ea796e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20019463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["syndromic detectability of outbreaks","outbreaks of dengue","past outbreaks","rare fevers","febrile syndromes","overlapping syndromes","relevant syndromic surveillance","estimated detectability of Ebola virus disease","simple syndromic case definitions","recent epidemics of Ebola virus disease","meningococcal disease","endemic fevers","locations of past unobserved outbreaks","conditions of perfect syndromic surveillance","rare haemorrhagic fevers","sub-Saharan Africa","infectious disease emergence","VHF detectability","clinical data","cases","places","aetiological identification of case clusters","public health infrastructure","overlapping febrile presentations","under-resourced health infrastructure","consequences of syndemics","published data","early detection","devastating consequences","larger epidemics","novel algorithm","large clusters","mapped estimates of malaria","clinical criteria present","Late detection of emerging viral transmission","potential future origins","diagnostic capacity","incidence","symptom presentation","typhoid fever","context-dependent tools","evidence","sparse healthcare","results","hidden hotspots","clear need","wildlife","filoviral diseases","region","implications"],"language":"en"},

Predicting the outcomes of such events in relation to possible interventions is crucial for societal and healthcare planning and forecasting of resource needs. Deterministic and mechanistic models can capture the main known phenomena of epidemics while also allowing for a meaningful interpretation of results. In this work a deterministic mechanistic population balance model was developed. The model describes individuals in a population by infection stage and age group. The population is treated as in a close well mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a steppingstone to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to non experts and policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play. The impact of specific interventions on the outbreak time course, number of cases and outcome of fatalities were evaluated including that of available critical care. Data available from the COVID19 outbreak as of early April 2020 was used. Key findings in our results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures appear effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the elderly (at higher fatality risk) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) an increase in the number of critical care beds could save up to eight lives per extra bed in a million population with the current parameters used; (iv) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears effective to dramatically reduce total fatalities when implemented extensively and in a high degree; (v) infection recognition through random testing of the population, accompanied by subsequent (self) isolation of infected aware individuals, can dramatically reduce the total fatalities but only if conducted extensively to almost the entire population and sustained over time; (vi) ending isolation measures while R0 values remain above 1.0 (with a safety factor) renders the isolation measures useless and total fatality numbers return to values as if nothing was ever done; (vii) ending the isolation measures for only the population under 60 y/o at R0 values still above 1.0 increases total fatalities but only around half as much as if isolation ends for everyone; (viii) a threshold value, equivalent to that for R0, appears to exist for the daily fatality rate at which to end isolation measures, this is significant as the fatality rate is (unlike R0) very accurately known. Any interpretation of these results for the COVID19 outbreak predictions and interventions should be considered only qualitatively at this stage due to the low confidence (lack of complete and valid data) on the parameter values available at the time of writing. Any quantitative interpretation of the results must be accompanied with a critical discussion in terms of the model limitations and its frame of application.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez, Jorge; Acuna, Juan M; Uratani, Joao M; Paton, Mauricio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43d4eadd45196bbbafecfb3c888c18274d917859.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total fatalities","isolation measures useless","selective isolation","universal social isolation measures","total fatality numbers","entire population","R0 values","outcome of fatalities","deterministic mechanistic population balance model","isolation of infected aware individuals","parameter values available","daily fatality rate","available critical care","meaningful interpretation of results","low numbers","infection stage","Data available","model limitations","present model","outbreak time course","number of critical care beds","number of cases","possible interventions","infection recognition","COVID19 outbreak predictions","Infection rates","low confidence","number of daily social interactions","time of writing","higher fatality risk","current low complexity","critical discussion","quantitative interpretation","impact of specific interventions","valid data","mechanistic models","main known phenomena of epidemics","current parameters","epidemiological information","accessibility","self","healthcare planning","transitions","relation","experts","lack of complete","elderly","policy makers","stages","variables","events","PPE","terms","random testing","increase","age group","use of protective equipment","safety factor","lower economic damage","mixed community","migrations","lives","resource needs","frame of application","extra bed","steppingstone","epidemic outbreaks","threshold value","high degree","Infectious diseases","pandemics","outcomes","play","Key findings"],"language":"en"},

The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such as Golgi- and recycling endosome-derived membranes.

We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus\u0027s dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson\u0027s test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus\u0027s spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006). Interpretation: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buja, A.; Paganini, M.; Cocchio, S.; Scioni, M.; Rebba, V.; Baldo, V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20078311v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-value","spread of COVID","virus\u0027s spread","province differences","province-level indicators","rate of COVID","potential province-level socioeconomic determinants","set of healthcare","trend of contagion","provinces of Northern Italy","private acute care hospital beds","private long-term care hospital beds","healthcare organization variables","availability of healthcare resources","socioeconomic factors","virus\u0027s dissemination","demographic parameters","aging population","aging index","Pearson\u0027s test","dependent variable","stepwise OLS regression model","relative increase","association","time endpoints","number of individuals","lesser extent","areas","coordination","input","data","significant difference","Multivariate analysis","countries","territories","confirmed cases of SARS","exponential growth","Interpretation","public transportation","speed","social contacts","Methods","ecological study","pandemic","world","Findings","infection","Background"],"language":"en"},

Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogue about COVID-19.

Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to DCTs including ribavirin, -interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2, the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted drugs such as camostat mesylate. Conclusions: At least 17 drugs for COVID-19 therapy with predictable pharmacogenes should be carefully utilized in risk races which are consisted of more risk allele carriers. At least 29 drugs with potential of DDIs are reported to be affected by other DDIs, they should be replaced by similar drugs without interaction if it is possible. Drugs which specifically targeted to infected cells with ACE2 such as chloroquine are preferred in COVID-19 therapy.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, L.-Y.; Cui, J.-J.; OuYang, Q.-Y.; Zhan, Y.; Wang, Y.-M.; Xu, X.-Y.; Guo, C.-X.; Yin, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d4761211df2d7da8b8832ab503a6409889862f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.23.20041350v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential drugs","COVID","targeted drugs","therapeutic drugs","similar drugs","therapy","chloroquine","ACE2","potential of DDIs","potential drug-drug interactions","multi DCTs","CYP3A4","ABCB1","pharmaco-genes","predictable pharmacogenes","single cell resolution","different drug efficiency","single-cell RNA sequencing","clinical guideline","infected cells","risk races","clinical trials databases","expression level of pharmaco","parts of lung cells","racial differences analyses","risk allele carriers","Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations","scRNA-seq","populations","exomes","toxicity","ITPA","virus binding","CYP3A5","SLCO1B1","ALB","G6PD","VDR","interferon","ribavirin","healthy adults","process","coronavirus disease","camostat mesylate","genetic factors","nCoV","Background","Variation information","lopinavir","Results","Methods","Conclusions","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

There is a need for a reproducible and objective method to provide quantitative information for those scores. Purpose - Towards this goal, we present a retrospective study testing the ability of a deep learning algorithm at extracting features from chest x-rays (CXR) to track and predict radiological evolution. Materials and Methods - We trained a repurposed deep learning algorithm on the CheXnet open dataset (224,316 chest X-ray images of 65,240 unique patients) to extract features that mapped to radiological labels. We collected CXRs of COVID-19-positive patients from two open-source datasets (last accessed on April 9, 2020)(Italian Society for Medical and Interventional Radiology and MILA). Data collected form 60 pairs of sequential CXRs from 40 COVID patients (mean age \u002B/- standard deviation: 56 \u002B/- 13 years; 23 men, 10 women, seven not reported) and were categorized in three categories: Worse, Stable, or Improved on the basis of radiological evolution ascertained from images and reports. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Results - On patients from the CheXnet dataset, the area under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for seven imaging features and one diagnosis. Deep learning features between Worse and Improved outcome categories were significantly different for three radiological signs and one diagnostic (Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Pleural Effusion and Pneumonia; all P \u003C 0.05). Features from the first CXR of each pair could correctly predict the outcome category between Worse and Improved cases with 82.7% accuracy. Conclusion - CXR deep learning features show promise for classifying the disease trajectory. Once validated in studies incorporating clinical data and with larger sample sizes, this information may be considered to inform triage decisions.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duchesne, S.; Gourdeau, D.; Archambault, P.; Chartrand-Lefebvre, C.; Dieumegarde, L.; Forghani, R.; Gagne, C.; Hains, A.; Hornstein, D.; Le, H.; Lemieux, S.; Levesque, M.-H.; Martin, D.; Rosenbloom, L.; Tang, A.; Vecchio, F.; Duchesne, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20086207v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Society for Medical and Interventional Radiology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusion - CXR deep learning features","extracting features","COVID patients","imaging features","repurposed deep learning algorithm","positive patients","unique patients","CXRs of COVID","Improved cases","radiological signs","radiological labels","Improved outcome categories","basis of radiological evolution","CheXnet dataset","CheXnet open dataset","chest X-ray images","current onslaught of COVID","chest x-rays","outcome category","clinical data","quantitative information","pairs of sequential CXRs","open-source datasets","Background - Decision scores","Consolidation","Pleural Effusion","Lung Lesion","promise","context of potential resources shortage","mean age","larger sample sizes","Interventional Radiology","characteristic analyses","Pneumonia","objective method","diagnostic","ability","Mann-Whitney tests","Italian Society","mechanical ventilation","mindful algorithms","area","retrospective study","ROC curves","goal","need","MILA","Receiver","standard deviation","studies","Methods","reports","disease trajectory","years","women","diagnosis","accuracy","Results","triage decisions","Materials"],"language":"en"},

We develop a lesion-attention deep neural network (LA-DNN) to predict COVID-19 positive or negative with a richly annotated chest CT image dataset. The CT image dataset contains 746 public chest CT images of COVID-19 patients collected from over 760 preprints, and the data annotations are accompanied with the textual radiology reports. We extract two types of important information from these annotations: One is the flag of whether an image indicates a positive or negative case of COVID-19, and the other is the description of five lesions on the CT images associated with the positive cases. The proposed data-driven LA-DNN model focuses on the primary task of binary classification for COVID-19 diagnosis, while an auxiliary multi-label learning task is implemented simultaneously to draw the model\u0027s attention to the five lesions of COVID-19 during the training. The joint task learning process makes it a highly sample-efficient deep model that can learn COVID-19 radiology features effectively with very limited samples.

Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Joan C.; Sausville, Erin L.; Girish, Vishruth; Yuan, Monet Lou; John, Kristen M.; Sheltzer, Jason M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6afcd323f35064f7915c92945698564cf517b81.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.013672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 levels","ACE2 expression","severe SARS-CoV","fatal SARS-CoV","viral infections","lung cells","subset of secretory cells","cell population","interferon treatment","cigarette smoke","concomitant increase","viral dissemination","interferon-stimulated gene","Chronic smoke exposure","single-cell sequencing data","dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin","expansion","abundance","receptor","positive-feedback loops","rodent","smokers","Enzyme","quitting smoking","respiratory tract","contrast","human lungs","factors","work","results"],"language":"en"},

Abstract COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease due to an infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus. It has become a pandemic in early 2020. The disease appears less devastating in children and adolescents. However, stress, quarantine and eventually mourning have major impacts on development. It is difficult to describe what this pandemic implies for a child psychiatrist, other than by giving a first-hand account. I propose to go through the main ethical questions that have arisen; to describe how my hospital team has reorganized itself to meet the new demands and questions, in particular by opening a unit dedicated to people with autism and challenging behaviors affected by COVID-19; and to address, in a context of national discussion, how the discipline has sought to understand the conditions of a certain well-being during quarantine. Finally, I will try to conclude with more speculative reflections on re-opening.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, David","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/568fc19bb4fb42c5097fb27a6838e5aae43112ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300907; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300907?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["to address","the discipline","to an infection with the SARS","sought to understand the conditions","dedicated to people with autism","reorganized itself to meet the new demands","in particular","Abstract COVID","pandemic in early","The disease appears less devastating in children","I will try to conclude with more speculative reflections","It is difficult to describe what this pandemic implies for","through the main ethical questions that","opening","CoV2 virus","virus SARS","pand\u00E9mie","principales questions \u00E9thiques","organ disease","certain well","national discussion","being during quarantine","contexte de discussion nationale","maladie multi-organes li\u00E9e","arisen","child psychiatrist","my hospital team","giving","other than","challenging behaviors affected","faire face","eventually mourning","personnes","autisme","nouvelles demandes","comportements d\u00E9fis atteints","particulier","questionnements","major impacts","adolescents","Finally","unit\u00E9 d\u00E9di\u00E9e","first-hand account","\u00E9quipe hospitali\u00E8re","development","stress","become","However","r\u00E9flexions","d\u00E9confinement","psychiatre","enfants","ann\u00E9e","chaud","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

A rapid expansion in cases affecting most countries around the globe led to major changes in the way people live their daily lives. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health and Social Care directed healthcare providers to establish additional resources to manage the anticipated surge in cases that could overwhelm the health services. A priority area was testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its detection by qualitative RT-PCR. Design A laboratory workflow twinning research environment with clinical laboratory capabilities was implemented and validated in the University of Birmingham within 4 days of the project initiation. The diagnostic capability was centred on an IVD CE-marked RT-PCR kit and designed to provide surge capacity to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The service was initially tasked with testing healthcare workers (HCW) using throat swabs, and subsequently the process investigated the utility of using saliva as an alternative sample type. Results Between the 8th April 2020 and the 30th April 2020, the laboratory tested a total of 1282 HCW for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs. RNA was detected in 54% of those who reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19, but in only 4% who were asymptomatic. Conclusion This capability was established rapidly and utilised a cold-chain free methodology, applicable to a wide range of settings, and which can provide surge capacity and support to clinical laboratories facing increasing pressure during periods of national crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bosworth, Andrew; Whalley, Celina; Poxon, Charlie; Wanigasooriya, Kasun; Pickles, Oliver; Aldera, Erin L; Papakonstantinou, Danai; L Morley, Gabriella; Walker, Eloise M; Zielinska, Agnieszka E; McLoughlin, Dee; Webster, Craig; Plant, Tim; Ellis, Andrew; Richter, Alex; Kidd, I.Michael; Beggs, Andrew D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68b0fea755308f8f50a4ee173718ae4ae6060e8c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220302110; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220302110?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Queen Elizabeth Hospital"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["surge capacity","clinical laboratory capabilities","anticipated surge","HCW","SARS-CoV","cases","throat swabs","RT-PCR kit","qualitative RT-PCR","testing healthcare workers","clinical laboratories","healthcare providers","Department of Health","health services","diagnostic capability","laboratory workflow twinning research environment","increasing pressure","support","reports of unidentified severe respiratory illness","Social Care","additional resources","saliva","way people","countries","IVD CE","detection","cold-chain free methodology","periods of national crisis","nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital","major changes","wide range of settings","days","Wuhan","globe","process","alternative sample type","daily lives","utility","rapid expansion","United Kingdom","total","University of Birmingham","project initiation","Abstract Background","priority area","symptoms compatible","COVID","China","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients\u0027 individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung\u0027s tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 \u002B/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reinacher, P.

There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"wang, D.; Guo, J.-M.; Yang, Z.-Z.; You, Y.; Chen, Z.-C.; Chen, S.-M.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, Y.-S.; Jiang, D.-Z.; Zuo, X.-L.; Zhu, X.-J.; Huang, J.; Wang, H.-X.; Li, Q.; Wu, Q.; Huang, Z.-P.; Liu, Q.-H.; Bao, Y.; Zhang, D.-L.; Zhang, X.-H.; Zhao, Z.; Ge, R.-Y.; Du, J.; Wang, Y.-P.; Ren, H.-B.; Han, H.; Wei, Y.-H.; Xiang, H.; Wan, C.-C.; Zhao, Y.-F.; Chen, B.; Yuan, G.-L.; Li, M.; Li, W.-m.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a649ef624f33877ca2b6f0e1a0cf980a1741c3bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.20034876v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CML"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["outcomes of CML patients","CML patients untill","clinical data of CML patients","Older patients","CML respondents","outcomes of COVID","prevalence of COVID","CML treatment","CML diagnosis","CML therapy","clinical diagnosis of COVID","clinical characteristics","Additional clinical data","clinical course","non-optimal response","poor response","epidemic","history of epidemiology","Secondary outcomes","demographic data","remote contact","close contact","definite contact","multi-center survey","comorbidities","cross-sectional survey","fever","epidemiological history","online survey","shortness of breath","cough","outbreak","questionnaire","symptoms","observational study","place of residence","combined medications","smoking status","traffic control","symptomatic infection","influence","pharmacies unable","case","increased risk of death","novel coronavirus disease","common type","regular referrals","hospitals","information","China","countries","SARS-CoV","Methods","primary outcome","management","Wuhan","regions","world","drugs","Interpretation","report","years","Background","Findings","males"],"language":"en"},

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte (MucFRE) fungi were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with the rare plant Lycopodiella inundata (\u2018marsh clubmoss\u2019), one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1,297 individual L. inundata roots collected during spring and autumn 2019 from 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of MucFRE-like hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. MucFRE-like hyphae were the dominant mycorrhizal fungi observed in all of the examined heathlands. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonised in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, and correlated with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about mycorrhizal status - typically drawn from single time point collections - should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are directly relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation nutrient enhancement treatments, microbial diversity and functional studies of host plants and symbionts.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kowal, Jill; Arrigoni, Elena; Serra, Jordi; Bidartondo, Martin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2843d98bdc03ddabf0c5b60cd9f238b3484e35dd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.080192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Britain","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["host-plant colonization","vesicles","Colonization levels","inundata roots","absence of MucFRE","resilient plant populations","dominant mycorrhizal fungi","rare plant Lycopodiella inundata","hyphae","mycorrhizal status","precipitation","temperature","spring","autumn","examined heathlands","earliest vascular plant lineages","nutritional mutualism","significant differences","marked seasonal differences","semi-natural heathlands","functional studies of host plants","agricultural bio-inoculation nutrient enhancement treatments","microbial diversity","species conservation plans","habitat restoration","critical components of terrestrial habitats","possible relationships","results","Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte","marsh clubmoss","agroecosystems","Britain","symbionts","local environments","role","single time point collections","occurrence rate","phenological patterns","findings","Netherlands","months","seasons","hyphal growth","sampling","prevalence","seasonality","presence","site","extent"],"language":"en"},

The Children\u2019s Hospital, Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) (https://covid19.cpmbiodev.net/) is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 18,000 (as of May 10, 2020) isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) at CHLA. Reference phylogenetic trees of global and USA viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. These provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection, as well as the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of interest. A web-based and interactive Phylogenetic Tree Browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation, as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration. A Virus Genome Tracker accepts complete or partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, compares it against all available sequences in the database (\u003E18,000 at time of writing), detects and annotates the variants, and places the new viral isolate within the global or USA phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons, in a few seconds.

Studies published till 20th April 2020 were included without language restriction. These studies include case reports, case series, cohort, and any other which reported BMI, overweight/obesity or underweight, and its complication with COVID-19 disease. Findings: Obesity plays a significant part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, though the role of BMI in the COVID-19 pandemic must not be ignored. Interpretation: Consequences of inflammation of adipose tissue has been reported as a leading cause of insulin resistance and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. The results of the current study show that BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity in all ages, especially the elderly population. A panel should review COVID-19 patients with higher BMI and other co-morbidities, and they should be given increased vigilance, testing priority, and therapy. Further, the COVID-19 patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age \u003E50 yrs, and elevated CRP levels should have additional medical considerations.

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Receptor expression on the cell surface facilitates viral binding and entry. However, reports of the abundance and distribution of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract are limited and conflicting. Objectives To determine ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract and its association with demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods Here, we systematically examined human upper and lower respiratory tract cells using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine where the receptor is expressed. Measurements and main results Our results reveal that ACE2 expression is highest within the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma where severe disease occurs, ACE2 was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells. We saw no increase of receptor expression in the presence of known risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019. Conclusions The mapping of ACE2 to specific anatomical regions and to particular cell types in the respiratory tract will help guide future studies and provide molecular targets for antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezara, Miguel Ortiz; Thurman, Andrew; Pezzulo, Alejandro; Leidinger, Mariah R.; Klesney-Tait, Julia A.; Karp, Philip H.; Tan, Ping; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; McCray, Paul B.; Meyerholz, David K.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb17bb7adc7c79d703b37eb7660fc6bf9c2d8749.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of ACE2 expression","severe coronavirus disease","increase of receptor expression","mapping of ACE2","disease outbreaks","human respiratory tract","severe disease development","current coronavirus disease","cellular receptor","receptor interactions","lower respiratory tract cells","range of disease severity","cell surface","SARS-CoV","particular cell types","sites of presumptive viral transmission","single-cell RNA sequencing","viral binding","efficient transmission","apical surface","main results","pulmonary alveoli","specific anatomical regions","presence of known risk factors","sinonasal cavity","association","future studies","small subset of alveolar type","molecular targets","questions","contributions of virus","immunohistochemistry","pandemic","Rationale Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses","host ectopeptidase","entry","abundance","antiviral therapies","lung parenchyma","clinical characteristics","Measurements","Conclusions","reports","Objectives","Methods"],"language":"en"},

We therefore assessed the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates in England. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional ecological analysis across upper tier local authorities in England. We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using negative binomial regression models, whilst adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80\u002B years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Findings: Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.04]. Interpretation: This study provides evidence that both income deprivation and ethnicity are associated with greater COVID19 mortality.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS: 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. All patients had a successful recovery and only one patient required admission in the intensive care unit. When using the same classification criteria (only COVID-19 positive cases with pneumonia), COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 suspected cases differs between tDMARDs.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michelena, X.; Borrell, H.; Lopez-Corbeto, M.; Lopez-Lasanta, M.; Moreno, E.; Pascual-Pastor, M.; Erra, A.; Serrat, M.; Espartal, E.; Anton, S.; Anez, G.

Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Qihui; Yi, Chunlin; Vajdi, Aram; Cohnstaedt, Lee W; Wu, Hongyu; Guo, Xiaolong; Scoglio, Caterina M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26a2d4b805cdb48bccb4d640da82fa4c4d15c7c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan City"],"keyphrases":["COVID","epidemic dynamics","Hubei Province","different epidemic trajectories","actual epidemic trajectory","non-Markovian processes","Markov processes","initial spreading","non-Markovian models","emerging infectious disease","protective measures","infectious period","early stage","effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions","coronavirus disease","simulation results","continued control measures","early case identification","social distancing","exponential distributions","daily cases","China","isolation","future works","individual-level network-based model","short-term predictor","epidemiological parameters","transmission","ensemble Kalman filter","Wuhan City","infection rate","recent studies","various scenarios","addition","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hernandez, Mark; Milechin, Lauren E; Davis, Shakti K; DeLaura, Rich; Claypool, Kajal T; Swiston, Albert","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd2cd004a197872cfce1c31a9685d6972f838efa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20029793","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Quarantine","early warning systems","high specificity early warning","high sensitivity early warning","near-ideal early warning capability","high-specificity early detection system","specific early detection system","sensitive early detection system","different outbreak scenarios","disease outbreak scenarios","near-ideal system","public health policies","alert policy","entire population","public health responses","various outbreak conditions","number of additional infections","additional infections relative","steering public health response","low disease transmission","health care professionals recognition of symptoms","different policies","detection of communicable pathogens responsible","simulation capability","utility of host","low initial population exposures","potential impact","baseline SEIR model","pathogen transmission","patient care","communicable diseases","onset of symptoms","deterministic SEIR","small increase","policy options","infectious individuals","major outbreaks","Self-monitoring","reporting","quantitative evaluation","percentage","spread","impacts","costs","reduction","numbers","false alarms","implementation","simulations","performance","Objective","Conclusions","Methods","tools","Results"],"language":"en"},

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries. Furthermore, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of the USA isolate (MT188341) leading to shift in amino acid frame from position 2540 onwards. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further revealed that multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-\u03B2, SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1/2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 \u0026 SPECC1) are manipulated by the viral proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune evasion. Thus, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges which need to be considered for developing effective treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Roshan; Verma, Helianthous; Singhvi, Nirjara; Sood, Utkarsh; Gupta, Vipin; Singh, Mona; Kumari, Rashmi; Hira, Princy; Nagar, Shekhar; Talwar, Chandni; Nayyar, Namita; Anand, Shailly; Rawat, Charu Dogra; Verma, Mansi; Negi, Ram Krishan; Singh, Yogendra; Lal, Rup","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a21891863a6f65761e3d8712704c485a5e68e519.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.006213","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["novel SARS-CoV","viral proteins","construction of SARS","viral isolates","different countries","evolved viral strains","multiple host proteins","replicative machinery of SARS","S-Protein","host challenges","neighboring countries","population of USA","human lives","spread","S-ORF3a complex","amino acid addition","amino acid frame","direct transmission pattern","N-protein","mediating host immune evasion","human interactome","nsp9-RdRp complex","high transmission rates","different geographical regions","PPP1CA","TGF-\u03B2","nsp16","nsp7-nsp8","PHB","PL-PRO","mRNA cap","RNA replication","SMAD3","SNPs","nsp13","JAK1","STAT3","SOCS3","result of travel","shift","ORF7a","infected humans","nsp2","underlying genomic severity","unique single nucleotide polymorphisms","fast evolving","BCL2","outbreak","methyltransferase","SPECC1","position","ORF1b polyprotein","severe respiratory pneumonia","CAV1","MT188341","complete genomes","Coronavirus Disease","COVID","effective treatment strategies","Wuhan","China","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by the ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths). Methods: We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 64 countries over a period of 78 days (n=4992). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 2.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p \u003C 0.01], as well as a 1.9 percentage points, decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p \u003C 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-22.92%) and CFR (-73.08%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications. Interpretation: We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.; Skiera, B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a660d6908f04abae6cc6db8e7c69eabeb1fef711.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093419v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UVI","CFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","cumulative number of COVID","daily growth rates of cumulative COVID","possibility of mitigating COVID","time-varying factors","daily growth rates of CFR","percentage points","underlying time trends","isolate UVI effect","protective role of UVB","country-specific time-constant","negative association of UVB radiation","protective role of Ultraviolet","significant percentage reduction","significant negative association","results","potential confounding factors","vitamin D intervention","vitamin D synthesis","ultraviolet index","Prior studies","clinical studies","observational study","fixed-effect log-linear regression model","different model specifications","hypothesis","sensible sunlight exposure","human health","terms","panel dataset","main dependent variables","evidence","case-fatality rate","period","countries","effective way","permanent unit increase","days","Research","weather","Background","Interpretation","possible solution","efforts","Methods","Findings"],"language":"en"},

This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented.

Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and presents a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre-existing liver damage and fibrosis.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as \u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Che; Gu, Jiaowei; Chen, Quanjing; Deng, Na; Li, Jingfeng; Huang, Li; Zhou, Xihui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ac9fa119b1818e217ab8c1f5b20b0d6a32c74ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["paediatrics patients","information of paediatric patients","intervention of paediatric patients","epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients","epidemiological features of paediatric patients","epidemiological characteristics of adult patients","clinical features","early diagnosis of COVID","Data analysis","radiological findings","lobules","basis of demographic data","early identification","valuable insight","medical history","new insight","exposure history","treatment information","Patchy lesions","Stratified analysis","levels of lactate dehydrogenase","\u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase","median incubation period","late-onset pattern of lesions","laboratory tests","glass opacity","adults","observational study","retrospective","chest","high-sensitivity C-reactive protein","case series","typical feature of ground","fever","hospitals","children","serum amyloid","tomographic scans","common initial symptoms","remarkable increase","addition","METHODS","respiratory pathogens","coronavirus disease","epidemic control policy","final follow-up visit","considerable portion of cases","west of China","Infections","months","IQR","CONCLUSIONS","decrease of prealbumin","Vomiting","diarrhea","limited samples","cough","BACKGROUND","males","days","expectoration"],"language":"en"},

Methods 904 axial lung window CT slices from 338 patients in 17 countries were collected and labeled. The data included 606 images from COVID-19 positive patients (confirmed via RT-PCR), 224 images of a variety of other pulmonary diseases including viral pneumonias, and 74 images of normal patients. We developed, trained, validated, and tested an object detection model which detects features in three categories: ground-glass opacities (GGOs) for COVID-19, GGOs for non-COVID-19 diseases, and features that are inconsistent with a COVID-19 diagnosis. These collected features are passed into an interpretable decision tree model to make a suggested diagnosis. Results On an independent test of 219 images from COVID-19 positive, a variety of pneumonia, and healthy patients, the model predicted COVID-19 diagnoses with an accuracy of 96.80 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.75 to 96.86) , AUC-ROC of 0.9664 (95% CI, 0.9659 to 0.9671) , sensitivity of 98.33% (95% CI, 98.29 to 98.40) , precision of 95.93% (95% CI, 95.83 to 95.99), and specificity of 94.95% (95% CI, 94.84 to 95.05). On an independent test of 34 images from asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved an accuracy of 97.06% (95% CI, 96.81 to 97.06) and a sensitivity of 96.97% (95% CI, 96.71 to 96.97). Similarly high performance was also obtained for out-of-sample countries, and no significant performance difference was obtained between genders. Conclusion We present an interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool to diagnose COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, our model is able to differentiate COVID-19 GGOs from similar pathologies suggesting that GGOs can be disease-specific.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warman, A.; Warman, P.; Sharma, A.; Parikh, P.; Warman, R.; Viswanadhan, N.; Chen, L.; Mohapatra, S.; Sapiro, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58743d8db8468ed880ab697c5177f47623411a66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.16.20103408v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic COVID","widespread COVID","non-COVID","model predicted COVID","positive patients","GGOs","asymptomatic patients","images of normal patients","healthy patients","object detection model","collected features","interpretable decision tree model","RT-PCR","independent test","accuracy","sensitivity","interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool","use of CT imaging","pulmonary diseases","variety of pneumonia","sample countries","suggested diagnosis","high performance","axial lung window CT slices","significant performance difference","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","Methods","viral pneumonias","categories","ground-glass opacities","similar pathologies","addition","diagnoses","resource allocation","genders","Conclusion","disease-specific","Results","confidence interval","data","AUC-ROC","precision","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases. Using the bioinformatics and structural modeling approach, we modeled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminal regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modeling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated proton channel. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds. Additionally, two distinct \u201Ccore\u201D structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral proton channeling activity which may play a critical role in viral infection.

Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1 and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been analyzed. Incorporation of the furin cleavage site (R-R-A-R) in the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has been studied by mutating the individual amino acid. Our results suggest the polytropic nature of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis indicated that a single amino acid substitution in the polybasic cleavage site of S protein perturb the binding of cellular proteases. This mutation study might help to generate an attenuated SARS-CoV-2. Besides, targeting of host proteases by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop its antiviral.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shokeen, Kamal; Pandey, Shambhavi; Shah, Manisha; Kumar, Sachin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.061507","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of S protein of SARS","proteolysis of S protein","protein of coronavirus","host cell proteases","host-cell proteases","proteolytic activation of S protein","attenuated SARS-CoV","polybasic cleavage site of S protein","different host proteases","host range","R-R","cellular spread of SARS","binding of cellular proteases","cell receptor","furin cleavage site","pathogenesis of coronavirus","receptor binding","individual amino acid","single amino acid substitution","Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus","present study","mutation study","infection","cathepsin B","S2","primary determinant","polytropic nature","S1","immense global health problem","practical approach","inhibitors","functional subunits","tissue tropism","decisive role","plasmin","analysis","fusion domain","entry","Incorporation","Spike","maturation process","results","antiviral"],"language":"en"},

An earlier study using a GFP-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E. coli) as a model organism demonstrated dispersal from drain biofilm in contaminated sinks. The present study further characterizes the dispersal of microorganisms from contaminated sinks. Replicate hand-washing sinks were inoculated with GFP-E. coli, and dispersion was measured using qualitative (settle plates) and quantitative (air sampling) methods. Dispersal caused by faucet water was captured with settle plates and air sampling methods when bacteria were present on the drain. In contrast, no dispersal was captured without or in between faucet events amending earlier theory that bacteria aerosolize from P-trap and disperse. Numbers of dispersed GFP-E. coli diminished substantially within 30 minutes after faucet usage, suggesting that the organisms were associated with larger droplet-sized particles that are not suspended in the air for long periods. IMPORTANCE Among the possible environmental reservoirs in a patient care environment, sink drains are increasingly recognized as potential reservoir of multidrug resistant healthcare-associated pathogens to hospitalized patients. With increasing antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic options for patients, better understanding of how pathogens disseminate from sink drains is urgently needed. Once this knowledge gap has decreased, interventions can be engineered to decrease or eliminate transmission from hospital sink drains to patients. The current study further defines the mechanisms of transmission for bacteria colonizing sink drains.","publish_time":"2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotay, Shireen; Donlan, Rodney M.; Ganim, Christine; Barry, Katie; Christensen, Bryan E.; Mathers, Amy J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05e514644f7692eeabe263e1da0055f617e63a21.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/392431","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contaminated sinks","hospital sink drains","bacteria","patients","Escherichia coli","dispersal of microorganisms","earlier study","present study","air sampling methods","settle plates","faucet events","faucet water","faucet usage","Numbers of dispersed GFP-","hand","current study","major reservoir of antibiotic resistant pathogens","potential reservoir of multidrug resistant healthcare-associated pathogens","patient care environment","patient-care areas","hospital outbreaks","drain biofilm","mechanisms of transmission","earlier theory","therapeutic options","possible environmental reservoirs","better understanding","model organism","increasing antimicrobial resistance","widespread acknowledgement","alarming rise","larger droplet-sized particles","IMPORTANCE","P-trap","minutes","dispersion","knowledge gap","interventions","long periods","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Methods: 90 individuals were enrolled in this study, 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Using two comprehensive 11-color flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and approved for clinical diagnostics, we longitudinally examined cell count differences in lymphocyte populations and T cell activation in COVID-19 patients. Findings: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and {gamma}{delta} T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Interestingly, follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. Interpretation: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Our data imply that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells contributes to convalescence in MD. Thus, understanding the T cell-response in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odak, I.; Barros-Martins, J.; Bosnjak, B.; Stahl, K.; David, S.; Wiesner, O.; Busch, M.; Hoeper, M.

Prioritization of MHC-I restricted viral epitopes remains a fundamental challenge for understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a consensus MHC-I binding prediction model, EnsembleMHC, based on the biochemical and structural basis of peptide presentation to aid the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides. We performed immunopeptidome predictions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins across 52 common MHC-I alleles identifying 658 high confidence peptides. Analysis of the resulting peptide-allele assignment distribution demonstrated significant variation across the allele panel up to an order of magnitude. Using MHC-I population-based allele frequencies, we estimated the average SARS-CoV-2 peptide population binding capacity across 21 individual countries. We have discovered a strong inverse association between the predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we found that the consideration of only structural proteins produced a stronger association with observed death rate, highlighting their importance in protein-targeted immune responses. The 108 predicted SARS-CoV-2 structural protein peptides were shown to be derived from enriched regions in the originating protein, and present minimal risk for disruption by mutation. These results suggest that the immunologic fitness of both individuals and populations to generate class I-restricted T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact clinical outcome from viral infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, E.; Herneise, G.; Singharoy, A.; Anderson, K.

En general, las medidas de control de la epidemia utilizadas hasta el momento se han basado en intervenciones adoptadas de la epidemiolog\u00EDa cl\u00E1sica, identificando y aislando los casos, siguiendo a los contactos y estableciendo restricciones, incluyendo la cuarentena, cierre de los centros educativos, evitando eventos en los que se produzca aglomeraciones de personas, limitando la movilidad. Estas medidas han sido efectivas en China, el foco originario del brote. Abstract In January 2020, the Chinese authorities confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 is a new virus of the coronavirus family. On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide. Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed. The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations. In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death. SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects. In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility. These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Alamino, Josep M\u00AA","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/840b860e1002697cf6ae55e08cbf4d848170077b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120302977; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120302977?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMS","Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial de la Salud","The World Health Organization","Human epidemics","limiting mobility"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["the original focus of the outbreak","the Chinese","of a multi","in the number of infected people","the WHO declared","the epidemic control","through the secretions of infected people","new virus of the coronavirus family","the route of transmission between humans","The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic","identifying and isolating the cases","confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December","the most serious complications","The World Health Organization","In general","epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth","closure of educational centers","following the contacts and establishing restrictions","far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology","avoiding events in which crowds of people occur","means that from a small number of cases in a few days","brote de casos","In cases with fatal progression","Abstract In January","have been effective in China","SARS","peque\u00F1o n\u00FAmero de casos","n\u00FAmero de personas infectadas","range from","medidas de control","OMS","secreciones de personas infectadas","aglomeraciones de personas","organ failure and patient death","outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide","On March","called COVID","progresi\u00F3n fatal","nuevo virus","familia coronavirus","Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial","propagaci\u00F3n mundial","high transmission rate","including quarantine","used","large","hands or contaminated objects","limiting mobility","d\u00EDas","complicaciones","agente causante","These","observed","fallo multiorg\u00E1nico","neumon\u00EDa de etiolog\u00EDa desconocida aparecido","gran incremento","inicio","cuarentena","cierre","centros educativos","intervenciones adoptadas","momento","espectro","epidemia utilizadas","Salud","enfermedad","pandemia","epidemiolog\u00EDa cl\u00E1sica","critical presentations","restricciones","eventos","muerte","paciente","autoridades chinas","elevada tasa de transmisibilidad","presentaciones leves","foco originario","epidemias humanas","crecimiento exponencial","manifestaciones cl\u00EDnicas","f\u00F3mites contaminados","transmisi\u00F3n","cr\u00EDticas","movilidad","contactos","humanos","Resumen"],"language":"es"},

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc\u003E500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borba, Mayla Gabriela Silva; Val, Fernando de Almeida; Sampaio, Vanderson Sousa; Alexandre, Marcia Almeida Ara\u0026uacutejo; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Brito, Marcelo; Mour\u0026atildeo, Maria Paula Gomes; Brito Sousa, Jos\u00E9 Diego; Baia-da-Silva, Djane Clarys; Guerra, Marcus Vinitius Farias; Hajjar, Ludhmila Abrah\u0101o; Pinto, Rosemary Costa; Balieiro, Antonio Alcirley Silva; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Xavier, Mariana Sim\u0101o; Salom\u00E3o, Alexandre; Siqueira, Andr\u00E9 Machado; Schwarzbolt, Alexandre; Croda, J\u00FAlio Henrique Rosa; Nogueira, Maur\u00EDcio Lacerda; Romero, Gustavo Adolfo Sierra; Bassat, Quique; Fontes, Cor Jesus; Albuquerque, Bernardino Cl\u00E1udio; Daniel-Ribeiro, Cl\u00E1udio Tadeu; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Lacerda, Marcus Vin\u00EDcus Guimar\u00E3es","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44b2618543d91a643535a802aa4fc71f043e7274.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ClinicalTrials.gov","CQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of CQ","low dose CQ","high dose CQ arm","different CQ dosages","higher CQ dosage","similar patients","nasogastric tube high dose CQ","total dose","patients sample size","updated COVID","adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients","established severe COVID","efficacy","day regimen","patient recruitment","days","results","study","potential safety hazards","patient management recommendations","CI of historical data","SARS-CoV","higher lethality","lower dosage","specific antiviral therapy","Interpretation Preliminary findings","phase IIb clinical trial","attention","disease","Manaus","paired samples","respiratory secretion","QTc","double-blinded","robust evidence","possible benefit of chloroquine","treatment","enormous global push","Brazilian Amazon","Background","ceftriaxone","Recent publications","Methods","trend","ms","ones","addition","azithromycin","number NCT04323527","Eligible participants","Fatality rate"],"language":"en"},

The human AdV (HAdV) species B and C, such as HAdV-C2, C5 and B14, cause respiratory disease, and constitute a health threat for immuno-compromised individuals. HAdV-Cs are well known for lysing cells, owing to the E3 CR1-\u03B2-encoded adenovirus death protein (ADP). We previously reported a high-throughput image-based screening framework and identified an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round infection, Nelfinavir Mesylate. Nelfinavir is the active ingredient of Viracept, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) aspartyl protease, and used to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is not effective against single round HAdV infections. Here, we show that Nelfinavir inhibits the lytic cell-free transmission of HAdV, indicated by the suppression of comet-shaped infection foci in cell culture. Comet-shaped foci occur upon convection-based transmission of cell-free viral particles from an infected cell to neighbouring uninfected cells. HAdV lacking ADP was insensitive to Nelfinavir, but gave rise to comet-shaped foci indicating that ADP enhances but is not required for cell lysis. This was supported by the notion that HAdV-B14 and B14p1 lacking ADP were highly sensitive to Nelfinavir, although HAdV-A31, B3, B7, B11, B16, B21, D8, D30 or D37 were less sensitive. Conspicuously, Nelfinavir uncovered slow-growing round-shaped HAdV-C2 foci, independent of neutralizing antibodies in the medium, indicative of non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission. Our study demonstrates the repurposing potential of Nelfinavir with post-exposure efficacy against different HAdVs, and describes an alternative non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission mode of HAdV.

Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%. This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wacharapluesadee, S.; Kaewpom, T.; Ampoot, W.; Ghai, S.; Khamhang, W.; Worachotsueptrakun, K.; Wanthong, P.; Nopvichai, C.; Supharatpariyakorn, T.; Putcharoen, O.; Paitoonpong, L.; Suwanpimolkul, G.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Hemachudha, P.; Krichphiphat, A.; Buathong, R.; Plipat, T.; Hemachudha, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20087221v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["testing of pooling specimen","pooling of specimen","testing of SARS","Pooling specimens","efficacy of pooling specimen","SARS-CoV","subsequent individual testing","low prevalence areas","low risk population","low incidence of infection","sensitivity","study","known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations","cost savings","resource savings","large-scale population screening","differing prevalence rates","lower risk populations","paired t-test","governmental bodies","lockdown restrictions","assured policy decisions","PPE","limited supply of tests","COVID","reagents","world","resources","PCR cycle threshold","factories","costs","possibility","virus","pandemic","lab operations","growing demands"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, they were mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and deletions (indels) instead of genomic mutations. Genomic diversity resulted in proteome diversity, with one-third to half of proteins variable among ASFV proteomes. Besides, nearly 20% of proteins had replications in adjacent positions. Further analysis identified extensive homologous recombination in the ASFV genomes, which is consistent with the occurrence of indels. Repeated elements of 15~50 bp were widely distributed in ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination.

The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF\u03B1, CXCL8. We also identified NF-\u03BAB and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules. Further, molecular docking analysis unveiled that NTASWFTAL possessed a greater affinity towards HLA and also available in a greater range of the population.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents\u0027 expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faasse, K.; Newby, J.

Methods: A retrospective review of all COVID-19 infected patients treated at Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 1 to Mar 20 was carried out. Continuous variables were described as mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables were compared by X2 test or Fisher\u0027s exact test between COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG (-) and mycoplasma lgG (\u002B). Results: Statistically significant differences were shown in terms of laboratory test results. COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity had a higher lymphocyte count and percentage (p=0.026, p=0.017), monocyte count and percentage (p=0.028, p=0.006) and eosinophil count and percentage (p=0.039, p=0.007), and a lower neutrophil count and percentage (p=0.044, p=0.006) than COVID-19 infected patients without mycoplasma lgG.

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells, notably type II alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, ACE2 gene is highly polymorphic. Here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. We found that S19P (common in African people) and K26R (common in European people) were, among the most diffused SNPs worldwide, the only two SNPs that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 spike. FireDock simulations demonstrated that while S19P may decrease, K26R might increase the ACE2 affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike. This finding suggests that the S19P may genetically protect, and K26R may predispose to more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calcagnile, Matteo; Forgez, Patricia; Iannelli, Antonio; Bucci, Cecilia; Alifano, Marco; Alifano, Pietro","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc380437a9c51cb6045f139b792ea2342c27ddd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe SARS-CoV","interaction of ACE2","current SARS covid","K26R","ACE2 affinity","ACE2 gene","S19P","diffused SNPs","spike glycoprotein","possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms","African people","European people","alveolar epithelial cells","sex-related factors","epidemic spread","exploits angiotensin","genetic susceptibility","silico tools","enzyme","diseases","FireDock simulations","receptor"],"language":"en"},

To determine trends in transition of this epidemic in India we performed a study in states at various levels of human development index (HDI). Methods: We used publicly available data sources to track progress of covid-19 epidemic in India in different states and territories where it was reported in significant numbers. The states (n=20) were classified into tertiles of HDI and weekly trends in cases and deaths plotted from 15 March to 2 May 2020. To assess association of HDI with state-level covid-19 burden we performed Pearson correlation. Logarithmic trends were evaluated for calculation of projections. A microlevel study was performed in select urban agglomerations for identification of socioeconomic status (SES) differentials. Results: There is wide regional variation in covid-19 cases and deaths in India from mid-March to early-May 2020. High absolute numbers have been reported from states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamilnadu. Growth rate in cases and deaths is slow in high HDI states while it has increased rapidly in middle and lower HDI states. In mid-March 2020 there was a strong positive correlation of state-level HDI with weekly covid-19 cases (r= 0.37, 0.40) as well as deaths (r= 0.31, 0.42). This declined by early-May for cases (r= 0.04, 0.06) as well as deaths (r= -0.005, 0.001) with significant negative logarithmic trend (cases R squared= 0.92; deaths R squared= 0.84). These trends indicate increasing cases and deaths in low HDI states. Projection reveals that this trend is likely to continue to early-June 2020. Microlevel evaluation shows that urban agglomerations are major focus of the disease in India and it has transited from middle SES to low SES locations. Conclusion: There is wide variability in burden of covid-19 in India. Slow growth and flattening of curve is observed in high-HDI states while disease is increasing in mid and lower HDI states. Projections reveal that lower HDI states would achieve parity with high HDI states by early-June 2020. Covid-19 is mostly present in urban agglomerations where it has transited from upper-middle to low SES locations. Public health strategies focusing on urban low SES locations and low HDI states are crucial to decrease covid-19 burden in India.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, R.; Dhamija, R.

Epidemiological figures of Covid19 epidemic in Italy are worse than those observed in China. Methods. We modeled the Covid19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible/exposed/infected/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions.

In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods.

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives. With the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post-hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use a likelihood-based inference method \u2014 previously called mixture models \u2014 for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that this likelihood-based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post-hoc corrections leading to less variation in point-estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend. We illustrate how the likelihood-based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test\u2019s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to identify classes of case sera with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures that have not been used for test validation. An R-package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided. Our study advocates to using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods with post-hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in COVID-19 serosurveys. Author Summary As other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibody responses in infected people that can be detected in their blood serum as early as a week after the infection until long after recovery. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can therefore be used as a marker of past infection, and the prevalence of seropositive people, i.e. people with specific antibodies, is a key measure to determine the extent of the Coronavirus pandemic. The serological tests, however, are usually not perfect, yielding false positive and negative results. Here we exploit an approach that refrains from classifying people as seropositive or negative, but rather compares the antibody level to that of confirmed cases and controls. This approach leads to more reliable seroprevalence estimates, especially for the low prevalence and low test accuracies that we face during the current Coronavirus pandemic. We also show how this approach can be extended to infer the presence of cases that have not been used for validating the test, such as people that underwent a mild or even asymptomatic infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouman, Judith A; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/822a01bb8fff7d74dd3367083040448e98fc3fa8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.068999","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approach","test validation","low test accuracies","imperfect serological tests","likelihood-based method","low seroprevalence levels","based methods","likelihood-based inference method","imperfect tests","Serological tests measure antibody responses","prevalence of seropositive people","reliable seroprevalence estimates","unknown distribution of quantitative test measures","infected people","cutoffs","past SARS-CoV","biased estimator of seroprevalence","current Coronavirus pandemic","low prevalence","asymptomatic infection","presence of SARS","Large-scale serological testing","marker of past infection","pathogens","cutoff levels","antibody level","specific antibodies","fraction of seropositive individuals","design of serosurveys","reliable estimation","presence of cases","classes of case sera","true extent","shortcomings of cutoff","point-estimates","key measure","negative results","confirmed cases","statistical inference procedure","sero-positives","mixture models","week","number of control","variation","corrections","power analysis functions","study advocates","negatives","R-package","Author Summary","test\u2019s ambiguity","temporal trend","blood serum","guidance","parameters","populations","controls","sensitivity","recovery","specificity","COVID"],"language":"en"},

As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants \u22651%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) \u22651% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene \u2013 ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this study. Author Summary Within-host variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno, Gage K.; Braun, Katarina M.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Prall, Trent M.; Riemersma, Kasen K.; Haj, Amelia K.; Lalli, Joseph; Florek, Kelsey R.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Friedrich, Thomas C.; O\u2019Connor, David H.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14358c597ffc4f985fb0dadadbb7a151a863ab44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Oxford Nanopore Technologies","Illumina MiSeq","Illumina","Vero"],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","host viral diversity","consensus sequences","cell culture","host variants","sub-consensus diversity","host frequency variants","diversity of virus populations","ongoing adaptation of SARS","viral evolutionary dynamics","sequence viral stocks","human host","viral genomic information available","ONT technologies","distinct Vero cell lines","evidence","primary isolate","China","genetic information","passaged samples","Wuhan","COVID","single nucleotide variants","Illumina MiSeq","causative virus","positive selection","individual hosts","individual returning","clinical swab","shared repositories","reports of pneumonia","Oxford Nanopore Technologies","dominant genetic signatures","characterizing interhost dynamics","mild purifying selection","antiviral therapeutics","GridION","experiments","selective pressures","population size changes","vaccine-induced immunity","stringency","molecular evolution questions","combination","minor","cells","GISAID","metagenomic approach","studies","day of hospital presentation","serial passages","considerable efforts","cultures","SNVs","principal repository","viruses","novel coronavirus","Author Summary","character of transmission bottlenecks","dramatic alterations","genotype","genome","vitro","Hubei province","need","preparation","outcomes","largest gene","Wisconsin","United States","ORF1a","study","hCoV"],"language":"en"},

Detecting viral RNAs on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs is the standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, there are only a few studies describing the serological diagnostic methods that involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG. Here, we aimed to develop a more quantitative and sensitive serological test for COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring and clinical investigation, based on the detection of antigen-specific IgA as well as IgM and IgG in blood in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In this investigation, we report the development of a set of validated diagnostic kits for detecting serum IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein by chemi-luminescence immuno-analysis. The kits were tested with a cohort of 216 sera from 87 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative or healthy individuals as negative controls. A standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Using the kits, serum levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG were analyzed, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Findings The diagnostic kits based on the RBD antigen outperformed those based on the NP. RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG detection kits showed sensitivities of 98.6%, 96.8%, and 96.8%, and specificities of 98.1%, 92.3%, and 99.8%, respectively. In addition, using purified RBD-specific immunoglobulins from a serum pool of COVID-19 patients as standards, the serum concentrations of RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG proteins were determined. The concentrations varied widely among different patients. Median concentration of IgA and IgM reached peaks at 16-20 days after illness onset at 8.84 \u03BCg/mL and 7.25 \u03BCg/mL, respectively, while median concentration of IgG peaked during 21-25 days after illness onset at 16.47 \u03BCg/mL. Furthermore, the serum IgA level positively correlates with COVID-19 severity. Interpretation Our immunoassay of measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies IgA, IgM, and IgG in serum provides a better serological testing with improved sensitivity and specificity. Data of IgA, IgM, and IgG responses in blood of COVID-19 patients may provide novel insight for the monitoring and treatments of COVID-19.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baker, M.

Data released by official authorities on COVID-19 cases is significantly affected by various factors such as size of sample, incubation period of disease and time taken to test the sample. These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000.

It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. However, there is a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To test the idea that penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA-Sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82) and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data therefore reject the theory that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Harvey, Erin; Shi, Mang; Gonzalez-Acu\u00F1a, Daniel; Holmes, Edward C.; Hurt, Aeron C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/551314700170030ade3f0a7eb7a3880a928bcbd7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.11.873513","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Antarctica","Antarctic"],"keyphrases":["Antarctic penguins","species of penguins","Antarctic species","Antarctic peninsula","tick viruses","viral species","penguin diet","likely penguin","microbial diversity","level of virome diversity","iconic Antarctic animal","limited understanding of virome diversity","associated microorganisms","repeated detection of specific viruses","lower pathogen pressure","experiences low pathogen pressure","viral families","situ virus evolution","key virus reservoirs","home","accounting","Antarctica","extent","diverse fauna","disease susceptibility","extreme climate","animals","theory","microbiome","viromes","ticks","foreign environments","isolation","idea","Australian waterbirds","data","total RNA","geographic regions","hosts","potential"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how to maximize the effectiveness of these policies while mitigating economic damage is essential. We develop a mathematical model with different levels of population health and economic risk to assess the impact of quarantine measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output. Methods: We combine an extended SEIR model that has multiple levels of health risk and economic vulnerability with disease parameters for the COVID19 pandemic to study the effects of quarantine policies. We examine the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and its economic impact for one year. We populate our model with a baseline of 95.6 % of high-risk people and 85.6 % of low-risk people in quarantine. We use our model to simulate leaving the current quarantine restrictions in place indefinitely. We then assess a policy where quarantine restrictions for lower-risk groups are gradually relaxed. Finally, we simulate relaxing quarantine restrictions more quickly. To compare outbreak outcomes under the same quarantine policies using different disease parameters, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the contagiousness of infected people, the strictness of social isolation measures, and the amount that public policymakers value the economy in setting quarantine restrictions. Findings: We first consider a baseline scenario with constant quarantine level, finding that in a population of 330,000,000 million, there are 32,023 deaths among those under 60 and 174,682 deaths among those over 60, there is a peak of 189,136 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 1.4 % smaller. In the scenario where higher-risk people are strictly quarantined, and for others the quarantine is slowly relaxed, there are 63,776 deaths among those under 60, 85,880 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 6% larger. In the scenario where quarantine is more quickly lifted, there are 25,720 deaths among those under 60, 214,718 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and economic output relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 4.5 % smaller. Interpretation: Strict restrictions on high-risk patients and a gradual lifting of quarantine for low-risk patients results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. We recommend this kind of strategy, combined with policies lowering the contagiousness of the disease and making quarantine more tolerable and economically viable for individuals.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldsztejn, Uri; Schwartzman, David; Nehorai, Arye","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45c20d510f70aff81b88e8c9d32f7f6997c27653.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20062802","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quarantine state","largescale quarantine policies","effects of quarantine policies","setting quarantine restrictions","current quarantine restrictions","relaxing quarantine restrictions","impact of quarantine measures","economic risk","gradual lifting of quarantine","constant quarantine level","economic impact","low-risk people","economic vulnerability","economic output relative","higher-risk people","hospitalizations","high-risk people","low-risk patients","lesser economic damage","limited number of deaths","beginning","economy relative","Strict restrictions","peak","multiple levels of health risk","lower-risk groups","different disease parameters","contagiousness of infected people","mathematical model","baseline scenario","pandemic infecting millions of people","different levels of population health","high-risk patients","extended SEIR model","dynamics of infectious disease transmission","COVID19 pandemic","strictness of social isolation measures","sensitivity analysis","public policymakers","Interpretation","outbreak outcomes","place","Summary Background","individuals","Methods","kind of strategy","year","effectiveness","Findings","globe"],"language":"en"},

Methods The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search using PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were performed using Medical subject heading (MeSH) words from the year 2000-2020. The articles focused on the use of masks and N95 respirators in healthcare workers were excluded. Results A total of 305 records were identified, out of which 14 articles were included in the review based upon quality and eligibility criteria. All the articles mentioned about the role of face masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, in the community or experimental setting. Studies also suggested that early initiation of face mask usage was more effective. Masks were also reported to be more effective in viruses that transmit easily from asymptomatic individuals, as is now known in SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off \u003E 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population. They should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, B.; Torriani, G.; Yerly, S.; Mazza, L.; Calame, A.; Arm-Vernez, I.; Zimmer, G.; Agoritsas, T.; Stirnemann, J.; Spechbach, H.; Guessous, I.; Stringhini, S.; Pugin, J.; Roux-Lombard, P.; Fontao, L.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Eckerle, I.; Vuilleumier, N.; Kaiser, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df1f8d510066c8d95a8482ed526fddcef4e0aced.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20080879v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgG and IgA","IgG","IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG assays","Euroimmun SARS-CoV","Euroimmun assay","IgG ratios","IgA assays","IgA immunoassay","optimal diagnostic accuracy","high diagnostic accuracy","IgG ratio cut-off","emergence of SARS","IgA serology","recombinant immunofluorescence assay","inter-assay imprecision","improved assay performance","pseudo-neutralization assay","rIFA","COVID","negative controls","negative predictive value","rule","optimized cut-offs","ROC curve analyses","positive predictive value","samples of patients","Discrepant cases","study population","case-control validation study","receiver","account","sera","spike protein","obvious gains","characteristic","AUCs","purposes","determination","ELISA","individuals","manufacturer","disease","laboratory","Confidence Interval","surrogate of protection","stage","Results","Conclusions","sensitivity","Methods","specificity","thresholds"],"language":"en"},

As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei\u0027s data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the \u03B1-factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient (\u03B1 factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The \u03B1 factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Leo, Stefano; Maia, Gabriel Gulak; Solidoro, Leonardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c2ce1e47dbb058a6f781e7df75b7bbcadfb10f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055327","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Europe","South America"],"keyphrases":["number of TCCpM","data analysis","number of cases","final TCCpM curves","spreading rate of COVID","number of Total Confirmed Cases","oscillating fitting parameters","data reveals","Hubei\u0027s data","number of infected people","\u03B1-factor","\u03B1 factor","European countries","total number of confirmed infections","epidemic center","statistical analysis","basis of analysis","pandemic development","confirmed cases ratio","larger data ensembles","short time frames","asymmetrical time integral","changes","corresponding time interval","determination of better parameters","disease","country","modelling","early prediction","South Korea","early stage","South America","constant values","linear model","multiple sections","new slight increase","Normal Distribution","outbreaks","standard deviation","local authorities","protective measures","trustworthy forecasts","impact","Italy","Lombardia","plateau","increases","initial phase","turn","present work","trend","angular coefficient","residents","different stages","estimation","Interpretation","introduction","Findings","Methods","affected regions"],"language":"en"},

Design: A cross-sectional, single-centre study. Setting: A large, teaching hospital based in Central London with tertiary infection services. Participants: 236 HCWs completed a survey distributed by internal staff email bulletin. 167 were female and 65 male. Measures: Information on symptomatology, exposures and health-seeking behaviour were collected from participants by self-report. Results: The 236 respondents reported illness compatible with COVID-19 and there was an increase in illness reporting during March 2020. Diagnostic swabs were not routinely performed. Cough (n=179, 75.8%), fever (n=138, 58.5%), breathlessness (n=84, 35.6%) were reported. Anosmia was reported in 42.2%. Fever generally settled within 1 week (n=110, 88%). Several respondents remained at home and did not seek formal medical attention despite reporting severe breathlessness and measuring hypoxia (n=5/9, 55.6%). 2 patients required hospital admission but recovered following oxygen therapy. 84 respondents (41.2%) required greater than the obligated 7 days off work and 9 required greater than 3 weeks off. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in staff reporting illness compatible with possible COVID-19 during March 2020. Conclusions cannot be drawn about exact numbers of confirmed cases due to lack of diagnostic swabbing. There were significant numbers of respondents reporting anosmia; as well as early non-specific illness prior to onset of cough and fever. This may represent pre-symptomatic HCWs who are likely to be infectious and thus criteria for isolation and swabbing should be broadened. The study also revealed concerning lack of healthcare seeking in respondents with significant red flag symptoms (severe breathlessness, hypoxia). This should be addressed urgently to reduce risk of severe disease being detected late. Finally, this study should inform trusts that HCWs may require longer than 7 days off work to recover from illness.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Wilton, A.; Kilich, E.; Chaudhry, Z.; Bell, L.

Epidemiological investigation of disease signs, time of onset, and transfers of affected cats between three facilities support a possible role for this new chapparvovirus in a highly contagious feline diarrhea and vomiting disease.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yanpeng; Gordon, Emilia; Idle, Amanda; Altan, Eda; Seguin, M.

Abstract Background Bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory disease in children under 2 years-old and a major cause of hospitalization in young children, especially during the winter. Objectives To determine the prevalence and etiology of bronchiolitis in south-east of Spain. Study design A prospective study was conducted during the bronchiolitis season (December-April). Children below 18 months-old admitted to the hospital for a first bronchiolitis episode were included. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respiratory syncytial virus. Results A total of 235 children were included during this period, and 235 RT-PCR were performed. A total of 287 viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 204 infants. Respiratory syncytial virus was the virus detected more frequently, followed by rhinovirus. Co-infections were found in the 36% of children. Conclusions Respiratory viruses were detected in most of the children below 18 months-old hospitalised with bronchiolitis, and 36% of them showed a mixed infection.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salvador Garc\u00EDa, C.; Moreno Doc\u00F3n, A.; Pi\u00F1ero, J.

Design: Prospective study of linked population-based and administrative data. Setting: UK Biobank data linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England from 16 March to 3 May 2020. Participants: 120,621 UK Biobank participants who were employed or self-employed at baseline (2006-2010) and were 65 years or younger in March 2020. Overall, 29% (n=37,890) were employed in essential occupational groups, which included healthcare workers, social and education workers, and other essential workers comprising of police and protective service, food, and transport workers. Poisson regression models, adjusted for baseline sociodemographic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors were used to assess risk ratios (RRs) of testing positive in hospital by occupational group as reported at baseline relative to non-essential workers. Main outcome measures: Positive SARS-CoV-2 test within a hospital setting (i.e. as an inpatient or in an Emergency Department). Results: 817 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and of these, 206 (0.2%) individuals had a positive test in a hospital setting. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.59, 95% CI: 5.43 to 10.62) and social and education workers (RR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.37 to 3.46) had a higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.57, 95% CI: 4.35 to 16.87) and social care workers (RR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.71 to 5.24) had highest risk within the healthcare worker and social and education worker categories, respectively. In general, adjustment for covariates did not substantially change the pattern of occupational differences in risk. Conclusions: Essential workers in health and social care have a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings underscore the need for national and organisational policies and practices that protect and support workers with elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mutambudzi, M.; Niedzwiedz, C.

There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling.

By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 % of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild. Grab samples were also collected from Bagcilar and Kartal manholes located nearby the pandemic hospitals on April 21st, 2020. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [5] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage taken from the inlets of treatment plants and manholes. Five samples out of seven from wastewater and all samples from manholes were tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage from Ambarli, Pasakoy, Kadikoy, Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs were found as 8.26x103, 1.80x104, ND, ND, 3.73x103, 4.95x103, 2.89x103, respectively. The Bagcilar and Kartal manholes nearby pandemic hospitals exhibited 4.49x104 and 9.33x104, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers of manhole were higher than those of inlet of WWTPs. The observed copy numbers were presented against the number of Covid-19 cases coming to the WWTP per treatment plant capacity. Quantitative measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used as a tool in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and it can provide information about SARS-CoV-2 distribution in wastewater of various districts of Istanbul which exhibit different scores of Covid-19 cases. The distribution of epidemy was followed not only with blood test but with wastewater monitoring. This may allow us to identify the districts not exhibiting many Covid-19 cases, but under high risk. Continuous monitoring of wastewater for SARS-Cov-2 may provide an early warning signs before an epidemy starts in case of infection resurge.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alpaslan Kocamemi, B.; Kurt, H.; Hacioglu, S.; Yarali, C.; Saatci, A.

Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, J.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Franz, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.15.20065102v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["standardized infectious rate","robust estimate of R0","aggressive isolation measures","standardized infection rate","isolation policy","permissive measures","range","Prior estimates of R0","corresponding public health capability","national health capacity","negative impact COVID","meta-analysis techniques","specific countries","current infectious severity status","robust estimation","Chinese government","Italy","effectiveness","basic reproduction number","significant threat","patients","good index","United States","order","study","population","world"],"language":"en"},

However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of over 500 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using an in silico model of translational efficiency, we validate the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. In particular, we propose that the improved translational adaptation to the upper respiratory airways of the pandemic agent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could enhance its transmissibility. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins, as upon infection cells undergo reprogramming of tRNA pools that favors the translation of late counterparts.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Schaefer, Martin H.; Serrano, Luis","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/053c3f9aa9487076cb808c9e73a0e75a93229c24.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translational machinery","tropism","viral codon usage","different viruses","different tissues","improved translational adaptation","correspondence","human-infecting viruses","silico model of translational efficiency","reprogramming of tRNA pools","infection cells","dynamic landscape of tRNA pools","productive infection","early viral proteins","upper respiratory airways","pandemic agent SARS-CoV","host cell","coronavirus","changes","translation of late counterparts","coding sequences","transmissibility"],"language":"en"},

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Jianghong; Liao, Xuejiao; Xiao, Tongyang; Qian, Shen; Yuan, Jing; Ye, Haocheng; Qi, Furong; Shen, Chengguang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Lifei; Cheng, Xiaoya; Li, Na; Cai, Qingxian; Wang, Fang; Chen, Jun; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Yunfang; Zhang, Feng; Fu, Yang; Tan, Xiaohua; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Zheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41d9f241a366f46e040eb97513dda682ea1c6a1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NRP patients","severe patients","potential cause of RP patients","close contacts of RP patients","non-RP","virus RNA","obvious clinical symptoms","suspicious clinical symptoms","clinical characteristics","sensitive RNA detection methods","clinical characterization","clinical parameters","mild COVID","RNA-negative samples","SARS-CoV","re-admission","earlier RNA negative-conversion","fewer symptoms","disease progression","effective management of COVID","high-sensitive detection methods","similar plasma antibody levels","hospitalization period","discharge","disease severity","Findings","hyper-sensitive method","inflammatory cytokine levels","sustained remission of CT imaging","carrier status of virus","evidence","significance","moderate conditions","empirical information","results","commercial kit","years old","total","convalescent phase","Interpretation","analysis","cases","days","follow-up","Background"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we aim to show through some solved examples how to introduce an environmental topic in the subject Mathematical Optimization. The problems goal is to decide on the best logistics for the transport and management of human waste that will be used in the production of sustainable energy. The context is that of improving the sanitation and hygiene in areas of the developing world, while simultaneously creating job opportunities within the communities. The research that we have conducted for finding the proper way to address the environmental analysis in class, led us first to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but later on, other theories such as the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) have proven to be more comprehensive and therefore, better.

Methods: This observational study, included data on all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was censored on March 8, 2020. This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients clinically confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated the association between changes in the incidence of AKI and COVID-19 disease and clinical outcomes by using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 287 patients, 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without AKI, AKI patients were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to present with hypoxia and have pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, AKI patients had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 14.3%, and the incidence of stage 2 or 3 AKI was 4.9%. Patients with AKI had substantially higher mortality. Conclusions: AKI is an important complication of COVID-19. Older age, male, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, lymphopenia, increased infection indicators, elevated D-dimer, and impaired heart and liver functions were the risk factors of AKI. AKI patients who progressed to stages 2 or 3 AKI had a higher mortality rate. Prevention of AKI and monitoring of kidney function is very important for COVID 19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, G.; Hu, H.; Wu, F.; Sha, T.; Huang, Q.; Li, H.; Han, J.; Song, W.; Chen, Z.; Zeng, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3125bb08cacc670207d384b655dc7b5a04ff535.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.20055194v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKI","COVID"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["AKI patients","incidence of AKI","Prevention of AKI","risk factors of AKI","confirmed COVID","important complication of COVID","higher chest","higher mortality rate","observational study","incidence of stage","higher prevalence of hyperkalemia","clinical outcomes","male","Hankou Hospital","cerebrovascular disease","Wuhan","China","data","higher levels of white blood cells","outcomes of acute kidney injury","elevated D-dimer","monitoring of kidney function","total bilirubin","pre-existing hypertension","Older age","multiple pre-existing comorbidities","lymphopenia","increased infection indicators","creatine kinase","procalcitonin","lactate dehydrogenase","aspartate aminotransferase","lower lymphocyte counts","liver functions","impaired heart","C-reactive protein","predictors","logistic regression models","hypoxia","retrospective","individuals","single-center","tomographic scores","Conclusions","changes","coronavirus","stages","laboratory records","association","Methods","Results","Background","analysis","Follow-up"],"language":"en"},

Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of COVID-19 in 199 countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country\u0027s policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country\u0027s life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor. While this study potentially suffers from a number of unknown confounding factors, these associations support the idea that BCG vaccination may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, which, together with its proven safety, encourages consideration of further detailed epidemiological studies, large-scale clinical trials on the efficacy of this vaccine on COVID-19, and/or re-introduction of BCG vaccination practice in the countries which are currently devoid of the practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sala, Giovanni; Miyakawa, Tsuyoshi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1bd6ce36d65c253f39712d702a10c962bc3282b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","BCG World Atlas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCG vaccination policy","BCG groups","BCG vaccine administration","cases ratio","BCG World Atlas","re-introduction of BCG vaccination practice","number of total cases","deaths indices","virus","country\u0027s policy","dividing countries","available data of COVID","slope categories","number of unknown confounding factors","overall spread","mortality rates","significant difference","tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","country\u0027s life expectancy","major confounding factor","non-specific beneficial effects","detailed epidemiological studies","large-scale clinical trials","associations","prevalence","consideration","non-related infections","middle","efficacy","protection","idea","low growth rate","average temperature","evidence","disease","progression","time","regions","possible association","onset","SARS-CoV","population","proven safety","linear regression modeling","contrast","variance","outcome","study"],"language":"en"},

Apart from China, there are currently three other severely affected areas, namely Italy, South Korea, and Iran. This poses a huge threat to China\u0027s and even global public health security, challenges scientific research work such as disease surveillance and tracking, clinical treatment, and vaccine development, and it also brings huge uncertainty to the global economy. As of March 11, 2020, the epidemic situation in China is nearing its end, but the epidemic situation abroad is in the outbreak period. Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide. 1.2 Method This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R / S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage. 1.3 Results Based on R / S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise. 1.4 Conclusion According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R / S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Xiaofeng; Tang, Zhou; Wang, Kejian; Li, Xianbin; Li, Houqiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/908fdf50a0b23ce11e42f224a8c6ae7ec0046b41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036756","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hurst"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Iran","China"],"keyphrases":["time series of confirmed cases","time series of future confirmed cases","number of confirmed cases","confirmed cases of COVID","future time series","cases of infection","H value of Hubei Province","correlation of time series","daily growth rate of confirmed cases","meaning of H value","future epidemic situation","Hubei provinces","stages of non-Hubei Province","Italy","different overall H values","calculated Hurst value","S analysis method","historical trend","data sample","different stages","Contrast analysis","strict anti-epidemic measures","growth period","outbreak period","trend of historical changes","different interpretation","Fractal characteristics","home","daily absolute number","daily rate of change","historical points","long-term memory","recession period","dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent","hierarchical isolation measures","fractal Brownian motion","downward trend characteristic","positive correlation","global economy","Wuhan City","high probability","huge threat","city nationwide","huge uncertainty","vaccine development","new coronavirus infection","global public health security","actual conditions of various countries","challenges scientific research work","disease surveillance","accordance","tracking","clinical treatment","China\u0027s","South Korea","past increases","Background","total","parts","affected areas","rescaled range","Iran","Results","article","volatility","biased random process","base of infectious agents","regions","world","Summary","Conclusion","periods","cutting point","span"],"language":"en"},

Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green.

Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically anti-viral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1/Card9- and type I and III interferon-signaling dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yahui; Kasahara, Shinji; Jhingran, Anupam; Tosini, Nicholas L.; Zhai, Bing; Aufiero, Mariano A.; Mills, Kathleen A.M.; Gjonbalaj, Mergim; Espinosa, Vanessa; Rivera, Amariliz; Luster, Andrew D.; Hohl, Tobias M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea7cf8a6044656111514065587a717016e0339e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079517","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pDCs act","fungal cells","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","lung-infiltrating neutrophils","monocyte-derived dendritic cells","anti-viral cells","Host defense","Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs","neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity","presence of normal neutrophil","Mo-DC numbers","CXCR3-dependent signals","positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity","ubiquitous mold","CXCR3 ligands","Aspergillus fumigatus","dependent manner","inhaled mold conidia","targeted pDC ablation","common cause of invasive aspergillosis","innate immune crosstalk","mucosal antifungal immunity","conidial killing","response","CXCL9","CXCL10","immunocompromised patients","Dectin","interactions","interferon","Card9"],"language":"en"},

Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations during outbreaks, both current and future.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chen; Li, Jizhou; Di, Lin; Jing, Qiuyu; Du, Pengcheng; Song, Chuan; Li, Jiarui; Li, Qiong; Cao, Yunlong; Xie, X.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilar, Jacob B; Faust, Jeremy Samuel; Westafer, Lauren M.; Gutierrez, Juan B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d24cd6723fa601766ab0d7e5e0c0bf2963756f3f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic sub-population","basic reproduction number","effective reproduction number","Coronavirus disease","number of reported cases","account asymptomatic carriers","robust communicable disease surveillance systems","public health surveillance systems","average rate of growth","model exhibit exponential growth","novel human respiratory disease","mathematical model","propagation of COVID","universal health care","average case data","countries","detection","agreement","initial value","major contributor","persons","weeks","accepted estimates","SARS-CoV","day","planet","months","clinical symptoms","Recent evidence","point estimate","mean parameters","pathogen","results","vicinity","manuscript","period","literature"],"language":"en"},

Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across scenarios with 65-95% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 infections. Estimated infections range from 119-504 between low and high transmission scenarios in the first 30 days; and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 58-139 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. Estimated deaths range from 1,647-2,109 between low and high transmission scenarios. Interpretation: A COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring unrealistically large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems. As global resources to fight this pandemic become scarce, displaced persons must not be forgotten.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Truelove, Shaun A; Abrahim, Orit; Altare, Chiara; Azman, Andrew; Spiegel, Paul B","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8ae244e16b8c8b0fa5110057818c2c7c8218f22.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Myanmar"],"keyphrases":["high transmission scenarios","potential COVID","transmission potential of SARS","healthcare needs","Estimated infections","healthcare capacity","Hospitalization needs","Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site","Estimated deaths range","stochastic disease transmission model","potential impact","introduction of SARS","refugee camps","Rohingya refugees","days","existing hospitalization capacity","daily rate of infections","epidemic speed","profound consequences","single introduction","refugee settlement","dire consequences","preparedness planning","realistic planning","health worker gaps","national health systems","infectious contacts","parameters","large increases","hospitalizations","infection burden","pandemic","radical strategies","settings","different assumptions","access","infrastructure","beds","virus","worst","large-scale outbreak","emerging literature","displaced persons","Plans","number","cases","Myanmar","global resources","general populations","Findings","Methods","Bangladesh","Interpretation","Projections","simulations","Background","months"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theodore Coroneo, Minas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b818cfa6c8e17745679095305899f5e67cfd4323.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542012420300896; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542012420300896?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eye","ocular tropism","differing ocular","systemic manifestations","systemic treatments","systemic administration","disease transmission","virus binding","ACE2 receptors","lacrimal-nasal pathway","disease patterns","influenza viruses","influenza pandemic","high viral loads","airborne viral particles","Respiratory infection transmission","particular risk of exposure","superficial tear film","downstream carriage","Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists","nasopharynx","lipophilic periocular skin","subsequent access","poor prognosis","common lessons","large surface area","key","enzyme","drugs","conjunctival angiotensin","SARS-CoV","invasion success","lungs","hand contact","aerosols","adnexae","resource-sparing intervention","Abstract Oculo-centric factors","hydroxychloroquine","azithromycin","adenoviral epidemics","gut","setting","Adenoviruses","combination","zinc","management","crisis"],"language":"en"},

An alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and others at high risk of severe disease, while allowing immunity to build up in those at low risk until the entire population is protected. We examine the performance required from a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is relaxed. We show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for population-level immunity, the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 15% of the population. Under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio (from 0.1% to 0.4%) and the performance of the classifier (3 to 4.5 bits of information for discrimination), we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group. We show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information from age, sex and medical records, at least 80% of those who would die if unshielded would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15% of the population. Although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does not vary much with the infection fatality ratio, the absolute number of deaths in the unshielded varies from less than 10,000 if the infection fatality rate is 0.1% to more than 50,000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 0.4%. For projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy, studies now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties: the extent to which infection confers immunity, the prevalence of immunity, the infection fatality ratio, and the performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records. It is time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the COVID-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity, avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKeigue, P.

Spatially structured stochastic models can capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a broader exploration of interventions.

The model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and travel data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in far fewer person-days of closure but only slightly more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, even under assumptions of high inter-county travel. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise significantly when county triggers are not coordinated by the province and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that phased plans for re-opening economies on the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider preceding larger-scale re-openings with coordinated local re-openings.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karatayev, V.; Anand, M.; Bauch, C.

Such a tool would provide timely and valuable guidance in clinical care decision-making during this global pandemic. Methods Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and treatment data (from 13 acute care facilities at Northwell Health) were extracted from electronic medical records and used to build and test the predictive accuracy of a survival probability calculator-the Northwell COVID-19 Survival (NOCOS) calculator-for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The NOCOS calculator was constructed using multivariate regression with L1 regularization (LASSO). Model predictive performance was measured using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the calculators tested. Results A total of 5,233 inpatients were included in the study. Patient age, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Emergency Severity Index (ESI), red cell distribution width (RCDW), absolute neutrophil count, serum bicarbonate, and glucose were identified as the optimal early predictors of survival by multivariate LASSO regression. The predictive performance of the Northwell COVID-19 Survival (NOCOS) calculator was assessed for 14 consecutive days. Conclusions We present a rapidly developed and deployed estimate of survival probability that outperforms other general risk models.

Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty. Findings In scenario I and II, the isolation-and-quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation-and-quarantine with additional cost of US$ 166 871 and US$180 140 respectively. The effectiveness of isolation-and-quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay-time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply; when the quarantine delay-time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost-effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay-time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions. Interpretation The isolation-and-quarantine was the most cost-effective intervention. However, personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation-and-quarantine. Certain restrictions should be considered, such as more initial imported cases, longer quarantine delay-time and lower quarantine probability.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qiang; Shi, Naiyang; Huang, Jinxin; Cui, Tingting; Yang, Liuqing; Ai, Jing; Ji, Hong; Xu, Ke; Ahmad, Tauseef; Bao, Changjun; Jin, Hui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5729b586bc1957db0b1bdd33bdf1acae0819236a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["quarantine delay-time","lower quarantine probability","lowering quarantine probability","single isolation","effectiveness of isolation","community containment","scenario","number of imported cases","initial imported cases","joint strategy of personal protection","virtual community","additional cost of US","incremental cost-effectiveness ratios","Coronavirus Disease","respiratory disease","optimal strategy","days","cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures","series of public health measures","avoided infectors","process of COVID","cost-effective intervention","number of infections","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","negative value of ICERs","stochastic agent-based model","previous literature","main outcomes","economic parameters","Method","SARS-CoV","susceptible-latent","field investigation","outbreak","lives","countries","sensitivity analyses","uncertainty","framework","quarter of individuals","China","humans","Interpretation","current assumptions","Certain restrictions","discovery","deaths","study","Findings"],"language":"en"},

It is widely accepted that the quality of cryoEM maps varies locally; therefore, the evaluation of the maps-derived structural models must be done locally as well. In this article, a method for the local analysis of the map-to-model fit is presented. The algorithm uses a comparison of two local resolution maps. The first is the local FSC (Fourier shell correlation) between the full map and the model, while the second is calculated between the half maps normally used in typical single particle analysis workflows. We call the new quality measure \u201CFSC-Q\u201D, and it is a quantitative estimation of how much of the model is supported by the signal content of the map. Furthermore, we show that FSC-Q may be helpful to avoid overfitting.

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganyani, Tapiwa; Kremer, Cecile; Chen, Dongxuan; Torneri, Andrea; Faes, Christel; Wallinga, Jacco; Hens, Niel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af266fac8970a7960e96630a67d91bec5dda0335.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore","China"],"keyphrases":["generation interval distribution","mean generation interval","incubation period distribution","serial interval distributions","outbreak data","China","Tianjin","days","Singapore","reported incubation period","underlying transmission network","different estimates","proportions pre-symptomatic transmission","proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission","COVID","symptom onset data","reproduction numbers","careful investigation","modelling studies","uncertainty","key infectious disease parameters","guiding intervention strategies","clusters","Detailed contact tracing information","Background","SD","Results","Conclusions","Methods","quantities"],"language":"en"},

Most countries have implemented numerous social distancing measures in order to limit its transmission and control the outbreak. This study aims to describe the impact of these control measures on the spread of the disease for Italy and Germany, forecast the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in both countries and estimate the medical capacity requirements in terms of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for optimal clinical treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients, for the Germany health system. Methods: We used an exponential decline function to model the trajectory of the daily growth rate of infections in Italy and Germany. A linear regression of the logarithmic growth rate functions of different stages allowed to describe the impact of the social distancing measures leading to a faster decline of the growth rate in both countries. We used the linear model to predict the number of diagnosed and fatal COVID-19 cases from April 10th until May 31st. For Germany we estimated the required daily number of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU) using clinical observations on the average lengths of a hospital stay for the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Results: Analyzing the data from Germany and Italy allowed us to identify changes in the trajectory of the growth rate of infection most likely resulted from the various social distancing measures implemented. In Italy a stronger decline in the growth rate was observed around the week of March 17th, whereas for Germany the stronger decline occurred approximately a week later (the week of March 23rd). Under the assumption that the impact of the measures will last, the total size of the outbreak can be estimated to 155,000 cases in Germany (range 140,000-180,000) and to 185,000 cases in Italy (range 175,000-200,000). For Germany the total number of deaths until May 31st is calculated to 3,850 (range 3,500-4,450). Based on the projected number of new COVID-19 cases we expect that the hospital capacity requirements for severe and critical cases in Germany will decline from the 2nd week of April onwards from 13,500 to ~2500 hospital beds (range 1500-4300) and from 2500 to ~500 ICU beds in early May (range 300-800). Conclusion: The modeling effort presented here provides a valuable framework to capture the impact of the social distancing measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in European countries and to forecast the future trend of daily COVID-19 cases. It provides a tool for medical authorities in Germany and other countries to help inform the required hospital capacity of the health care system. Germany appears to be in the middle of the (first) COVID-19 outbreak wave and the German health system is well prepared to handle it with the available capacities.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klabunde, Thomas; Giegerich, Clemens","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2c73930e23bd83d4be8fe9f166318811b53f89b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["Germany health system","critical COVID","Italy","range","critical cases","fatal COVID","epidemic trend of COVID","control measures","impact","week","required daily number of hospital beds","numerous social distancing measures","various social distancing measures","terms of hospital beds","hospital capacity requirements","required hospital capacity","daily growth rate of infections","future trend of daily COVID","projected number of new COVID","stronger decline","ICU beds","health care system","European countries","faster decline","outbreak wave","intensive care units","logarithmic growth rate functions of different stages","medical capacity requirements","German health system","total number of deaths","exponential decline function","trajectory","patients","linear model","optimal clinical treatment of severe","clinical observations","medical authorities","linear regression","total size","ICUs","order","average lengths","spread","disease","modeling effort","valuable framework","tool","transmission","data","changes","SARS-CoV","Conclusion","global pandemic","Methods","Results","assumption","middle","available capacities","objective","study"],"language":"en"},

Summary In 2009, a new emerging flu virus, A(H1N1), was identified. Its true medical impact on children\u0027s health remains widely debated. Aim To define the prevalence of respiratory disease in children hospitalized with fever during the influenza A(H1N1) epidemic and to determine the clinical, paraclinical, and outcome characteristics according to the viruses identified. Material and methods Children hospitalized for a febrile respiratory disease were included in this prospective cohort study conducted at Bordeaux University\u0027s Children\u0027s Hospital (France) during the influenza epidemic from 2009/11/23 to 2009/12/20. Results Seventy-three children were included in the study. Viruses were identified by PCR in 52% (38/73) of cases, including 23% (17/73) A(H1N1) virus and 29% (21/73) other viruses, 22% (16/73) of which were syncytial respiratory viruses. There was only one case of co-infection between A(H1N1) virus and another virus from the para-influenza virus or adenovirus or bocavirus pool. No significant difference regarding age, sex, or risk factors in the different viral groups was noted. Regarding the A(H1N1) virus, the most frequent symptoms were deterioration of the overall health status, cough, ENT disease, and rapid breathing, with significantly less increased breathing effort and auscultatory abnormality albeit with more seizures. There was no significant difference between groups regarding laboratory data. Management and outcome were similar. Conclusion The prevalence of A(H1N1) virus during the 2009 epidemic in Aquitaine was low among febrile hospitalized children with breathing symptoms. Clinical and paraclinical signs were non-specific. The tolerance and prognosis of influenza A(H1N1) infection in children was satisfactory.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feret, V.; Naud, J.; Harambat, J.; Malato, L.; Fleury, H.; Fayon, M.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f24069c6157cb20b380659e0740780c6ed7e6a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X14001729; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X14001729","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Children\u0027s Hospital"],"locations":["Bordeaux","Aquitaine","France"],"keyphrases":["H1N1","virus during the","virus para","virus Influenzae","nouveau virus","Regarding the","another virus from the para-influenza virus","The tolerance","virus respiratoires syncitiaux","fonction des virus identifi\u00E9s","faible pr\u00E9dominance du virus","Conclusion The prevalence","three children were included in the study","to determine the clinical","during the influenza epidemic from","new emerging flu virus","respiratory disease in children hospitalized with fever during the influenza","Viruses were identified","infection in children was satisfactory","PCR in","Summary In","the overall health status","was identified","Aim To define the prevalence","the most frequent symptoms were deterioration","outcome characteristics according to the viruses identified","risk factors in the different viral groups was noted","epidemic in Aquitaine was low among febrile hospitalized children with breathing symptoms","paraclinical signs were","outcome were similar","which were syncytial respiratory viruses","There was only","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie grippale","methods Children hospitalized for","febrile respiratory disease were included in this prospective cohort study conducted at Bordeaux University\u0027s Children\u0027s Hospital","other viruses","There was no significant difference between groups regarding laboratory","co-infection between","ENT disease","rapid breathing","France","No significant difference regarding age","atteintes oto","pool viral","paracliniques","h\u00F4pital des Enfants","seule co-infection","bocavirus pool","enfants hospitalis\u00E9s","caract\u00E9ristiques cliniques","diff\u00E9rence significative","with significantly less increased breathing effort","auscultatory abnormality albeit with more seizures","pr\u00E9valence virale","identification virale","children\u0027s health remains widely debated","gravit\u00E9 particuli\u00E8re li\u00E9e","anomalies de la fr\u00E9quence respiratoire","cough","Its true medical impact","centre hospitalier universitaire","monocentrique men\u00E9e","p\u00E9riode","adenovirus","Results Seventy","laryngologiques","toux","rhino","facteurs de risque","ad\u00E9novirus","anomalie auscultatoire","alt\u00E9ration","\u00E9tat g\u00E9n\u00E9ral","sexe","\u00E9tude \u00E9pid\u00E9miologique","\u00E2ge","Material","\u00E9mergence","prognosis","signes de lutte","charge","sympt\u00F4mes","Management","specific","hospitalisation","\u00C9volution","convulsions","\u00E9l\u00E9ments","Objectifs","groupes","identifications","plan paraclinique","cases","including","r\u00E9percussion m\u00E9dicale","ensemble","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","R\u00E9sultats","M\u00E9thodes"],"language":"fr"},

This study is the first in the world about the psychological status of the medical team during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To study the correlation between risk factors and general symptom index (GSI) score of medical team members who support Wuhan against COVID-19. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based. Participants: Anhui Province sent a total of eight medical teams,including 1382 members,to support Hubei Province. We adopted a stratified sampling method and selected the fourth team sent by Anhui Provincial Hospital, with a total of 137 members as our subjects. Exposures: Four main exposures were collected, including basic information, preparations before going to Wuhan, life issues and working issues after going to Wuhan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The GSI score of SCL-90 scale was used to reflect the frequency and intensity of psychological symptoms. We made the hypothesis of this study before data collection. Results: 110(80.29%) members completed the questionnaire, of which, 77(70.00%) female and 33(30.00%) male. When adjusted age, gender and covariates, DC, LCWT had a positive correlations with GSI score(beta was 10.17, 95%CI was 3.30 to 17.04 for DC, P=0.00\u003C0.05;beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71 for LCWT, P =0.04\u003C0.05;respectively), RBT had a negative positive correlation with GSI score (beta was -28.09, 95%CI was -45.79 to -10.40, P=0.00\u003C0.05), AoBI did not had a correlation with GSI score (beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71, P=0.16\u003E0.05).

Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronavirus\u2019s surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 \u00C5. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the \u201Cclosed\u201D prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \u201Copen\u201D conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perkins, Alex; Espana, Guido","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20076018v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tapering of control","optimal control analysis","effectiveness of social distancing","social distancing restrictions","economic impacts of social distancing","range of possible strategies","SARS-CoV","results","optimal controls","COVID","pandemic","mathematical model of SARS","qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes","short term lead","basic reproduction number","fewer options","alternative approaches","lives","summer","higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity","minimal deaths","considerable uncertainty","vaccine","high level","world","reduced time","spread","epidemiological parameters","quantitative forecast","potential scope","societies","desire","consequences","major factor","light","uncertainties","data","transmission","virus","measures"],"language":"en"},

Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient\u0027s prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-\u002B19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P\u003C0.001).

The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health and economic inequality in the United States. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population: 102,178,117 [median: 73,447, IQR: 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). Findings: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1,981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Interpretation: The observed inequality might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.

In this study, we report the occurrence and co-occurrence of different virus types and subtypes among the patients arriving at the pediatric emergency room of New York Presbyterian Hospital, a major urban hospital. Methods: We collected nasal swabs from the patients and their accompanying persons. We also recorded the levels (None, Mild, High, and Severe) of their symptoms (Fever, Chill, Muscle Pain, Watery Eye, Runny Nose, Sneezing, Sore throat and Cough). The collected swabs were tested for the presence of common viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Results: Human Rhinovirus was the most common virus among the patients, followed Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Human Rhinovirus was most common in summer, autumn and spring. In contrast, influenza was more common in winter. Further, Influenza A virus was more likely to co-occur with Corona Virus 229E. In comparison, Influenza was less likely to co-occur with Human Rhinovirus. Moreover, Influenza, Parainfluenza and Corona virus were associated with more severe symptoms, while Human Rhinovirus was associated with less severe symptoms. In addition, we observed that Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus were more likely to infect a patient when these viruses also infected the accompanying person. We also found that it was difficult to distinguish among viruses based on the symptoms. The inability to distinguish among different virus types and subtypes is explained by the fact that multiple viruses lead to similar symptoms.

The government of various countries, their citizens, politicians, and business owners are worried about the unavoidable economic impacts of this pandemic. Therefore, there is an eagerness for the pandemic peaking. Objectives: This study uses an objective approach to emphasize the need to be pragmatic with easing of lockdowns measures worldwide through the forecast of the possible trend of COVID-19. This is necessary to ensure that the enthusiasm about SARS-CoV-2 peaking is properly examined, easing of lockdown is done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. Methods: We used the Facebook prophet on the World Health Organization data for COVID-19 to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the 7th April until 3rd May 2020. The forecast model was further used to forecast the trend of the virus for the 8th until 14th May 2020. We presented the forecast of the confirmed and death cases. Results: Our findings from the forecast showed an increase in the number of new cases for this period. Therefore, the need for easing the lockdown with caution becomes imperative. Our model showed good performance when compared to the official report from the World Health Organization. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.6%. Conclusion: Although, the global and economic impact of COVID-19 is daunting. However, excessive optimism about easing the lockdown should be appropriately weighed against the risk of underestimating its spread. As seen globally, the risks appeared far from being symmetric. Therefore, the forecasting provided in this study offers an insight into the spread of the virus for effective planning and decision-making in terms of easing the lockdowns in various countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alabi, R.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S.; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.016790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["extant SARS-CoV","high quality SARS-CoV","major clades of SARS","viral super-clades","ongoing adaptation of SARS","presence of distinct viral episomes","different viral strains","biased geographic distribution of SARS","Phylogenomic analysis of SARS","different geographic locations","distinct geographic locations","prevalent groups of viral episomes","present viral protein coding genes","different adaptive evolutionary pressures","absence of distinct evolutionary patterns","spike protein","founder effects","novel virus","evidence","isolates","hypervariability of specific protein coding regions","observed patterns of variability","variable genomic regions","levels of genomic variability","available repositories","novel pathogen","cross species adaptation","China","RDB domain","genomes","signatures","USA","rapid spread","genome sequences","notion","outbreaks","genetic drift","Europe","knowledge","UTRs","analyses","study"],"language":"en"},

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Y.; Diao, B.; Lv, X.; Zhu, J.; Liang, W.; Liu, L.; Bu, W.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, S.; Shi, M.; Ding, G.; Shen, B.; Wang, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dbfb1122839fd2802805136525b502f9dc74d28.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.24.20027201v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HD","CT","ICU","NK"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["PBMCs of HD patients","non-HD COVID","outbreak of COVID","new COVID","HD centers","collateral impacts of COVID","epidemic management","epidemic control","epidemic extinction","immune profile of dialysis patients","HD center of Renmin Hospital","global epidemic of contagious diseases","infected cases","level of prevention","Th cells","killer T cells","NK cells","remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines","cerebrovascular diseases","protection","underlined diseases","Measures of prevention","day","lymphocytes of T cell","incapability of mounting cytokines storm","severe pneumonia","clinical presentation","Wuhan University","frequency of lymphocytes","cardiovascular events","key measures","universal screening","impaired cellular immune function","high risk area","susceptible population","serious threat","isolation","unlikely progress","distribution","chest","ground glass","human life","epidemiology","hyperkalemia","peripheral blood","changes","leukocytes","results","response","staff","presumed causes of death","CT images","course","healthy volunteers","groups","study","early stage","report","attention","ICU","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at incidence rates up to 0.02 per person-day in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period. This shows an example of the infection risk in tourist destinations being several fold higher than elsewhere in the region. In Norway, this is also supported by high rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time.

During this week, it seems, \u0022everything changed.\u0022 Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic.

The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peixoto, Pedro S.; Marcondes, Diego R.; Peixoto, Cl\u00E1udia M; Queiroz, Lucas; Gouveia, Rafael; Delgado, Afonso; Oliva, S\u00E9rgio M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/653eaae28583c6bc6b3e78fcc4e46539b3ac3922.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056739","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","Sao Paulo","Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["mobile data","disease spread","Mobile geolocation data","contagious disease","states of Brazil","millions of anonymized mobile visits data","assessment of movement patterns","probable spreading patterns","risk of infection","epidemic models","great risk","states of Sao Paulo","study","city","high risk regions","capital cities","Metapopulation models","potential spatial spreading","measure of population mobility","valuable asset","resources allocation","public administrators","action plans","place","COVID","crucial tool","Janeiro","order","countryside","period","work","outbreak","time"],"language":"en"},

Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is made by skeletal muscle during infancy but levels drop postnatally and into adulthood. It is essential for the survival and wiring-up of sensory afferents from muscle. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into the affected triceps brachii forelimb muscle improves sensorimotor recovery after ischemic stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move this therapy one step nearer to the clinic, we set out to test the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after ischemic cortical stroke in adult rats. To simulate a clinically-feasible time-to-treat, twenty-four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into triceps brachii for four weeks using implanted minipumps. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory deficits on the affected forearm. There was no evidence of forepaw sensitivity to cold stimuli after stroke or NT3 treatment. MRI confirmed that treatment did not induce neuroprotection. Functional MRI during low threshold electrical stimulation of the affected forearm showed an increase in peri-infarct BOLD signal with time in both stroke groups and indicated that neurotrophin-3 did not further increase peri-infarct BOLD signal. Rather, NT3 induced spinal neuroplasticity including sprouting of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. Neurophysiology showed that NT3 treatment increased functional connectivity between the corticospinal tracts and spinal circuits controlling muscles on the treated side. After intravenous injection, radiolabelled NT3 crossed from bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in adult mice with or without strokes. Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of neurotrophin-3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duricki, Denise A.; Drndarski, Svetlana; Bernanos, Michel; Wood, Tobias; Bosch, Karen; Chen, Qin; Shine, H.

Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds.

This will lead to negative impacts in many sectors. Saudi Arabia not only plays an important role on the economical side because it is the leading country in oil production, but also because it is considered the heart of the Islamic countries. Although protective measures have been implemented in Saudi Arabia, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased. Aims of the study: This study aimed to employ SIR model to forecast the peak of COVID-19 progression and an estimation of it is end in Saudi Arabia. Method: Based on the World Health Organization data on COVID-19 progression in Saudi Arabia from March 3rd to April 29th, 2020, we reliably estimate the constant parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and potential ending time. Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered are the main components of the SIR model that were used to run the analysis. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 20th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 20th of May. Then the cases will decrease until the 55th day, which is around June 20th.

There are reports of a reduction in non-Covid-19 emergency presentations. Consequentially, there are concerns that deaths from non-Covid-19 causes could increase. We examined recent reported population-based mortality rates, compared with expected rates, and compared any excess in deaths with the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. Methods: National agency and death registration reports were searched for numbers of deaths attributed to Covid-19 and overall mortality that had been publicly reported by 16 April 2020. Data on the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19, the total number of deaths registered in the population and the historical average over at least 3 years were collected. Data were available for 3 Northern European countries (England \u0026 Wales, Scotland and the Netherlands) and New York State, United States of America. Results: There was an increase in observed, compared with expected, mortality in Scotland (\u002B27%), England and Wales (\u002B35%), the Netherlands (\u002B60%) and New York state (\u002B26%).

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer reported fluence of 100 W/cm^2 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately 15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theory Division, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute; Card,; K.

People with hearing loss regularly experience difficulties interacting in everyday conversations. These difficulties in communication can result in a person with hearing loss withdrawing from social situations and becoming isolated. While hearing health loss research has largely deployed quantitative methods to investigate various aspects of the condition, qualitative research is becoming more widespread. Grounded theory is a specific qualitative methodology that has been used to establish novel theories on the experiences of living with hearing loss. Method and analysis: The aim of this systematic review is to establish how grounded theory has been applied to investigate the psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Studies included in this review will have applied grounded theory methodology. For a study to be included, it can apply grounded theory as an overarching methodology, or have grounded theory methodology embedded amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies, prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded. Studies included will have adult participants ([\u2265]18 years) who are either people with an acquired hearing loss, their family and friends (communication partners), or audiologists. The quality of application of grounded theory in each study will be assessed using the Guideline for Reporting and Evaluating Grounded Theory Research Studies (GUREGT). Ethics and dissemination: As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review, ethical approval is not required. No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds the registration record of this systematic review. Findings will be disseminated via peer reviewed publications and at relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published in relevant professional and third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will inform future research and guideline development. Prospero registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019134197 Strengths and limitations of this study: This systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive critique of the use of grounded theory to investigate hearing loss. The search strategy was formed in collaboration with an information specialist at the University of Nottingham. The PRISMA-P guidelines have directed the considerations and layout of this protocol. Because experiences and articulations of hearing loss are influenced by age, only adult ([\u2265]18 years) participants (people with hearing loss, communication partners, audiologists) will be considered. The search will not include grey literature. The studies included will only have samples of individuals with hearing loss, rather than full deafness.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Y. H.

DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. There were no differences in age or sex among groups (p \u003E.05). Initial symptoms included fever (100%), coughing (85%), dyspnea (76%), diarrhea (42%) and asthenia (21%). The majority of patients in this case series were hospitalized because of low SpO2 (SpO2 below 90%) and presentation of bilateral pneumonia (94%) at triage. ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95% vs 61%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100% of the ICU-patients. All the patients included in the study required oxygen therapy. ICU-patients had lymphopenia as well as hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU (p \u003C .001).Lower albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis measured as longer hospital length (r= -0.472, p \u003C.001) and mortality (r= -0.424, p=.003). Interestingly we also found, that MCV was lower among of those patients who died (p=.0002). As of April 28, 2020, 10 patients (8 ICU and 2 non-ICU) had died (21% mortality) and while 100% of the non-ICU patients had been discharged, 33% of ICU patients still remained hospitalized (5 in ICU and 2 had been transferred to ward). CONCLUSION Critically ill patients with COVID-19 present lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia as well high levels of inflammation.

Population level interventions (PLIs) impact this threat, with estimable large effects on reducing mortality. Many countries worldwide have currently zero/low mortality and many have yet to implement such PLIs. The importance of timing of PLI implementation on mortality outcomes is poorly understood. We extracted cumulative country-specific COVID-19 mortality for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to examine country-specific mortality trends and found that all five countries experienced COVID-19 mortality epidemics initially of exponential nature. We estimated the magnitude of effect on mortality of the nationwide PLI implemented on day 18 of Italy\u0027s mortality epidemic and assessed the importance of timing of PLI implementation by computing the effect of implementation of a PLI of this magnitude at various times on subsequent mortality. The nationwide PLI in Italy saved an estimated 6,170 lives by day 30 of the Italian epidemic. Implementing a PLI with this effect magnitude in a country of 60 million people on the day of the first death, and on days 7, 10, 14 and 17 thereafter, compared to implementation on day 18, resulted in substantially greater numbers of lives saved. Implementation on day 1 resulted in an additional 3,477 lives saved, 6,955 intensive care unit admissions and 52,162 hospital admissions prevented, beyond that achieved by implementation on day 18. PLI implementation earlier than day 18 substantially enhances benefit.

While teleneurology is regularly used in acute stroke care, its application in other branches of neurology was limited. Here we review how the recent pandemic has created a paradigm shift in caring for patients with chronic neurological disorders and how academic institutions have responded to the present need. Method Literature review was performed to examine the recent changes in health policies. Number of outpatient visits and televisits in the Department of Neurology was reviewed from Yale University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to examine the road to transition to televisit. Results The federal government and the insurance providers extended their supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several rules and regulations regarding teleneurology were revised and relaxed to address the current need. New technologies for video conferencing were incorporated. The transition to televisits went smoothly in both the institutions and number of face-to-face encounters reduced dramatically along with a rapid rise in televisits within 2 weeks of the declaration of national emergency. Conclusion and relevance The need for \u201Csocial distancing\u201D during the COVID-19 pandemic has created a major surge in the number of teleneurology visits, which will probably continue for the next few months. It may have initiated a more permanent transition to virtual technology incorporated medical care.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Bhaskar; Nowak, Richard J.; Roda, Ricardo; Khokhar, Babar; Patwa, Huned S.; Lloyd, Thomas; Rutkove, Seward B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/554a794ecb1d0c787a478c3be908edfeb8faeb52.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302677; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302677?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Yale University School of Medicine","Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of teleneurology visits","COVID","recent pandemic","televisits","pandemic mandated rapid transition","permanent transition","number of face-to-face encounters","Number of outpatient visits","present need","current need","Johns Hopkins School of Medicine","Yale University School of Medicine","academic institutions","rapid rise","medical care","Department of Neurology","recent changes","branches of neurology","acute stroke care","Method Literature review","chronic neurological disorders","caring","patients","weeks","paradigm shift","application","virtual technology","insurance providers","major surge","relevance","social distancing","supports","Abstract Background","declaration of national emergency","New technologies","video conferencing","federal government","health policies","road","Conclusion","rules","regulations","months"],"language":"en"},

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armijos-Jaramillo, Vinicio; Yeager, Justin; Muslin, Claire; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09756d8b8e6325520b710277fc1bf4fc9483f439.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.001933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor-binding domain","receptor binding domain","human receptor hACE2","human host receptor","human cells","potential binding","inhibiting binding","viral spike protein","SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2","host cells","positive selection","coronaviruses recognition","spike glycoprotein","selection pressures","viral evolution","different coronaviruses","evolutionary dynamics","betacoronavirus spike protein genes","divergent viral lineages","putative sites","conserved sites","modeling studies","emergence of SARS","Modeling results","novel virus","novel infectious disease","prevention of coronavirus infections","critical role","union","permitting bat variants","various scales of relatedness","hot spot","effective strategy","structural stability","genomic regions","origin","glycine residue","salt bridges","way theory","global pandemic","insights","factors","understanding","wake","animal reservoir","analysis","deaths"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 infection has limited preventive or therapeutic drug options at this stage. Some of common existing drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been hypothesised to impact on disease severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older people residing in nursing homes. The purpose of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older people residing in nursing homes. Methods and Findings. We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study in two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 diagnoses were based on clinical suspicion and/or viral presence using PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified. The outcomes were defined as 1) serious COVID-19 defined as a long-stay hospital admission (length of stay [\u2265] 7 days) or death (at hospital or nursing home) within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Disease symptoms were defined as any COVID-19-related clinical symptom (e.g. coughing, dyspnoea, sore throat) or sign (low oxygen saturation and fever) for [\u2265] 2 days out of 3 consecutive days. Logistic regression models with Firth corrections were applied on these 154 subjects to analyse the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with the outcomes. Age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension were used as covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of our statistical significant findings. We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 infection (unadjusted OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71; p=0.011), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, functional status, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The strength of this association was considerable and clinically important. Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome (long-stay hospitalisation or death) were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.25-1.85; p=0.556). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 1.52; CI 0.62-3.50; p=0.339) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.79; CI 0.26-1.95; p=0.629). Conclusions. Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail people could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. The role of statins and any interaction with renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Spiegeleer, A.; Bronselaer, A.; Teo, J.

Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Wenjiao; Shi, Yuru; Qi, Yingjie; Liu, Jiaxing; Liu, Ting; Chen, Zhaowu; Zhang, Wenjing; Wang, Mengmeng; Liu, Dongfeng; Yin, Ming; Xu, Jing; Yang, Yun; Zhu, Xiaowu; Ge, Jing; Zhu, Shu; Gao, Yong; Ma, Xiaoling","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20dac5e0ae0b02b285b234ec454336b7c9835cf2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20039065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CAP patients","confirmed patients","non-NCP patients","suspected patients","transferred confirmed NCP patients","identification of NCP","epidemic of NCP","SARS-CoV","fungal infections","fungal cultures","common pathogens of CAP","secondary infections","co-infection cases","fungal serologic tests","common respiratory tract pathogens","certain proportion of infection","multiple pathogen detection","Novel coronavirus pneumonia","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","multiplex PCR","microbiological analysis","realtime RT-PCR","accurate microbiological laboratory assay","Science","optimized strategy","diagnosis efficiency","sputum","Affiliated Hospital of University","Technology of China","Anhui province","dual swab samples","contagious community","adenovirus","rhinovirus","USTC","personalized medication","comparison","studies"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. Results: The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from non perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis . In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes. Most patients had normal body temperature, white blood cell count and neutrophil count. This is a new entity of appendicitis. The clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis showed the features of infectious disease in epidemiology. The entity of perforated appendicitis was not found.

We show that \u003E80% of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the United States. In addition, we show that the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February. Notably, none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state, suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine.

Though current evidence on the epidemiology of the disease is emerging, very little is known about the predictors of recovery. We describe the epidemiology of confirmed CoVID-19 patients in Republic of Korea and identify predictors of recovery. Materials and methods: Using publicly available data for confirmed CoVID-19 cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 20, 2020 to April 30, 2020, we undertook descriptive analyses of cases stratified by sex, age group, place of exposure, date of confirmation and province. Correlation was tested among all predictors (sex, age group, place of exposure and province) with the Pearsons correlation coefficient. Associations between recovery from CoVID-19 and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Majority of the confirmed cases were females (56 percent), from 20-29 age group (24.3 percent), and primarily from three provinces Gyeongsangbuk (36.9 percent), Gyeonggi (20.5 percent) and Seoul (17.1 percent). Case fatality ratio was 2.1 percent and 41.6 percent cases recovered. Older patients, patients from certain provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangbuk, Jeju, Jeollabuk and Jeollanam, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery. Conclusions: Our study adds to the very limited evidence base on potential predictors of recovery among confirmed CoVID-19 cases. We call additional research to explore the predictors of recovery and support development of policies to protect the vulnerable patient groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, A.; Gopalan, S.

The BCG vaccine is used in the prevention of tuberculosis, a disease that is most prevalent in developing countries. To determine the potential protective role of BCG vaccination, this study investigated the occurrence of Covid-19 and the relationship between the spread of Covid-19 in countries that offer BCG vaccination and those that do not. The study also performed a phylogenetic analysis of the strains involved in the Covid-19 outbreak from the representative countries. To achieve the objectives, the study utilized publicly available data on population size, vaccination coverage, and Covid-19 cases. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine if some SARS-CoV-2 strains were more prevalent than others. The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer the BCG vaccine to the general population and the reported cases of Covid-19. The study proposes future molecular and immunological analyses to determine the potential role of BCG vaccination in protection against Covid-19. This will determine if BCG has antiviral properties, with the possibility of recommending it for widespread use if supported by scientific data.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mariita, R.

Seeking \u201Cpeople\u0027s behavioral changes,\u201D in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muto, Kaori; Yamamoto, Isamu; Nagasu, Miwako; Tanaka, Mikihito; Wada, Koji","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048876","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diamond Princess"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["younger participants","precautionary measures","Japanese government instituted countermeasures","precautionary actions","precautionary behavior","Japanese citizens","percent of female","percent of over-","Japanese population","social distancing","study","people\u0027s behavioral changes","online platform","spread of infection","years old","important event","important strategies","online research company","proper prevention measures","smoking habit","cross-sectional survey","typical characteristics","drinking","quota sampling","COVID","Diamond Princess cruise ship","lower-income households","higher extraversion score","micro data","exercise self-restraint","public","Information","local governments","pneumonia","statistical analysis","individuals","various means","circumstances","new coronavirus","females","Frequent handwashing","total","respondents","purpose","cooperation","end","results"],"language":"en"},

A number of explanations have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence about how apparent fatality rates may be expected to vary with the different testing regimes, admission policies and other variables. An individual patient simulation model was developed to address this question. Parameters and sensitivity analysis based upon recent international data sources for Covid-19 and results were averaged over 100 iterations for a simulated cohort of over 500,000 patients. Different testing regimes for Covid-19 were considered; testing admitted patients only, various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases and active contact-tracing and screening. In the base case analysis, apparent mortality ranged from 10.5% under a policy of testing only admitted patients to 0.4% with intensive contact tracing and community testing. These findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding admission rates and the rate of spread, with more selective admission policies and suppression of spread increasing the apparent mortality and the potential for apparent mortality rates to exceed 18% under some circumstances. Under all scenarios the proportion of patients tested in the community had the greatest impact on apparent mortality. Whilst differences in mortality due to health service and demographic factors cannot be excluded, the current international differences in reported mortality are all consistent with differences in practice regarding screening, community testing and admission policies.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michaels, Jonathan A; Stevenson, Matt D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e917bb0f4f89520b6be9b52df77dd6ef0d050d92.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050633","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apparent mortality rates","apparent differences","admission rates","reported mortality","policy of testing","apparent fatality rates","different testing regimes","various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases","Covid","selective admission policies","proportion of patients","current international differences","screening","active contact-tracing","intensive contact tracing","suppression of spread","rate of spread","confirmed cases","sensitivity analysis","base case analysis","recent international data sources","assumptions","health service","practice","countries","potential","demographic factors","clear evidence","greatest impact","individual patient simulation model","extensive speculation","iterations","Parameters","results","simulated cohort","findings","deaths","variables","scenarios","number of explanations","question","circumstances"],"language":"en"},

The molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of the initial immune response to infection, either as a protective response or as detrimental immunopathology, are not well understood. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor expressed on immune cells that has been implicated in induction and maintenance of excessive inflammation. Here, we analyze the role of this receptor in a mouse model of influenza virus infection using a receptor knockout (KO) mouse strain. Our results demonstrate that the absence of the P2X7 receptor results in a better outcome to influenza virus infection characterized by reduced weight loss and increased survival upon experimental influenza challenge compared to wild-type mice. This effect was not virus strain specific. Overall lung pathology and apoptosis were reduced in virus-infected KO mice. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), gamma interferon (IFN-\u03B3), and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) was also reduced in the lungs of the infected KO mice. Infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b(\u002B) macrophages, characteristic of severe influenza virus infection in mice, were lower in the KO animals. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the P2X7 receptor is involved in the exacerbated immune response observed during influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2017-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leyva-Grado, Victor H.; Ermler, Megan E.; Schotsaert, Michael; Gonzalez, Ma G.; Gillespie, Virginia; Lim, Jean K.; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/028382edbe67a35f1e099fa0607fa9a4922a45d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5371412.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse model of influenza virus infection","characteristic of severe influenza virus infection","P2X7 receptor results","virus-infected KO mice","receptor knockout","purinergic receptor P2X7","exacerbated immune response","initial immune response","experimental influenza challenge","main causes of influenza","immune cells","protective response","KO animals","wild-type mice","mouse strain","ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor","reduced weight loss","induced lung damage","Overall lung pathology","increased survival","better outcome","macrophages","IFN-\u03B3","fate","apoptosis","depletion of CD11b","CC chemokine ligand","chemokines","interleukin","induction","gamma interferon","absence","Production of proinflammatory cytokines","maintenance of excessive inflammation","Infiltration of neutrophils","CCL2","detrimental immunopathology","lungs","activation","molecular mechanisms","effect","role"],"language":"en"},

Ten phenolic compounds were simultaneously quantified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone were found to be the main compounds in J. rigida needles, with the highest contents detected for catechin and podophyllotoxin. J. rigida from Jilin (S9, S10) and Liaoning (S11) exhibited the highest contents of phenolic profiles (total phenolics, total flavonoids and 10 phenolic compounds) and the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activities, followed by Shaanxi (S2, S3). A similarity analysis (SA) demonstrated substantial similarities in fingerprint chromatograms, from which 14 common peaks were selected. The similarity values varied from 0.85 to 0.98. Chemometrics techniques, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA), were further applied to facilitate accurate classification and quantification of the J. rigida samples derived from the 11 regions. The results supported HPLC data showing that all J. rigida samples exhibit considerable variations in phenolic profiles, and the samples were further clustered into three major groups coincident with their geographical regions of origin. In addition, two discriminant functions with a 100% discrimination ratio were constructed to further distinguish and classify samples with unknown membership on the basis of eigenvalues to allow optimal discrimination among the groups. Our comprehensive findings on matching phenolic profiles and bioactivities along with data from fingerprint chromatograms with chemometrics provide an effective tool for screening and quality evaluation of J. rigida and related medicinal preparations.","publish_time":"2017-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zehua; Wang, Dongmei; Li, Dengwu; Zhang, Shuai","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b515cc5df8df49a37037106bfe3d94a2370e30bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5395569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395569/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Juniperus"],"organizations":["HPLC"],"locations":["East Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["rigida samples","rigida needles","Juniperus rigida","phenolic compounds","highest contents of phenolic profiles","matching phenolic profiles","discriminant analysis","similarity analysis","fingerprint chromatograms","hierarchical cluster analysis","principal component analysis","HPLC data","quality of","primary regions","catechin","podophyllotoxin","main compounds","China","geographical regions of origin","total phenolics","total flavonoids","quality evaluation of","RP-HPLC","Chemometrics techniques","optimal discrimination","discriminant functions","discrimination ratio","similarity values","major groups coincident","bioactivities","effective tool","HCA","screening","reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography","basis of eigenvalues","substantial similarities","S10","strongest antioxidant","PCA","considerable variations","antibacterial activities","chlorogenic acid","comprehensive findings","Shaanxi","Liaoning","S11","unknown membership","S9","related medicinal preparations","quantification","S2","amentoflavone","Jilin","East Asia","accurate classification","common peaks","S3","ethnomedicinal plant","addition","results","study"],"language":"en"},

It is increasing studies in patients with pneumonia to reveal that coinfection with viral and bacterial infection can lead to poorer outcomes than no coinfection. This study evaluated the role of coinfection identified through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination on the outcomes of pneumonia-related ARDS. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from October 2012 to May 2015. Adult patients were included if they met the Berlin definition of ARDS. The indications for BAL were clinically suspected pneumonia-related ARDS and no definite microbial sample identified from tracheal aspirate or sputum. The presence of microbial pathogens and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 19,936 patients screened, 902 (4.5%) fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS. Of these patients, 255 (22.7%) had pneumonia-related ARDS and were included for analysis. A total of 142 (55.7%) patients were identified to have a microbial pathogen through BAL and were classified into three groups: a virus-only group (n = 41 [28.9%]), no virus group (n = 60 [42.2%]), and coinfection group (n = 41 [28.9%]). ARDS severity did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.43). The hospital mortality rates were 53.7% in virus-only identified group, 63.3% in no virus identified group, and 80.5% in coinfection identified group. The coinfection group had significantly higher mortality than virus-only group (80.5% vs. 53.7%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In patients with pneumonia-related ARDS, the BAL pathogen-positive patients had a trend of higher mortality rate than pathogen-negative patients. Coinfection with a virus and another pathogen was associated with increased hospital mortality in pneumonia-related ARDS patients.","publish_time":"2017-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, Kuo-Chin; Chiu, Li-Chung; Hung, Chen-Yiu; Chang, Chih-Hao; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Huang, Chung-Chi; Hu, Han-Chung","journal":"Shock","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c06d577eae200ba80f2df918825449503e7c228.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5398903.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5398903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","BAL"],"locations":["Berlin"],"keyphrases":["pneumonia-related ARDS patients","coinfection group","virus group","suspected pneumonia-related ARDS","outcomes of pneumonia","ARDS severity","Adult patients","pathogen-negative patients","BAL pathogen-positive patients","Berlin definition of ARDS","role of coinfection","increased hospital mortality","hospital mortality rates","trend of higher mortality rate","clinical outcomes","Memorial Hospital","poorer outcomes","groups","definite microbial sample","presence of microbial pathogens","prospective observational study","leading risk factor of acute respiratory distress syndrome","tracheal aspirate","Chang","bacterial infection","bronchoalveolar lavage","examination","sputum","BACKGROUND","indications","METHODS","analysis","studies","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the early expression levels of any of these 16 genes are predictive for post-stroke blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Transcriptional expression levels of candidate genes were measured in peripheral blood sampled from ischemic stroke patients at emergency department admission, and BBB permeability was assessed at 24 hour follow up via perfusion-weighted imaging. Early heightened expression levels of AKAP7, a gene encoding a protein kinase A-binding scaffolding molecule, were significantly associated with BBB disruption 24 hours post-hospital admission. We then determined that AKAP7 is predominantly expressed by lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and strongly co-expressed with ITGA3, a gene encoding the adhesion molecule integrin alpha 3. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that heightened expression of AKAP7 and ITGA3 in primary human lymphocytes is associated with a highly adherent phenotype. Collectively, our results suggest that AKAP7 expression levels may have clinical utility as a prognostic biomarker for post-stroke BBB complications, and are likely elevated early in patients who later develop post-stroke BBB disruption due to the presence of an invasive lymphocyte population in the peripheral blood.","publish_time":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Connell, Grant C.; Treadway, Madison B.; Petrone, Ashley B.; Tennant, Connie S.; Lucke-Wold, Noelle; Chantler, Paul D.; Barr, Taura L.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d1125dd2aac5fa05600973b570834950bbcbccc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5430856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peripheral blood expression levels","AKAP7 expression levels","early expression levels","post-stroke BBB disruption","heightened expression of AKAP7","Early heightened expression levels of AKAP7","post-stroke BBB complications","post-stroke blood brain barrier","Transcriptional expression levels of candidate genes","BBB permeability","ischemic stroke patients","acute ischemic stroke","hours post-hospital admission","ITGA3","emergency department admission","binding scaffolding molecule","primary human lymphocytes","adhesion molecule integrin alpha","prognostic biomarker","clinical utility","presence","protein kinase","invasive lymphocyte population","experiments","results","perfusion-weighted imaging","study","group","adherent phenotype","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test. We also compare the performances of networks with different connectivity density and find that PLPIHS performs well across all the networks. Furthermore, we use the proposed method to identify the related proteins for lncRNA MALAT1. Highly-ranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Yun; Zhang, Jingpu; Deng, Lei","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4f9ea9e0aeb74d3601ee316b84292638c59cc53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5473862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lncRNA-Protein Interactions","lncRNA-protein pair","lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network","lncRNA-protein association network","protein-protein interaction network","lncRNA MALAT1","supported lncRNA-protein associations","PLPIHS","intrinsic features of lncRNA","heterogeneous network","Existing network-based methods","biological studies","HeteSim Scores","topologies of biological networks","lncRNAs","RNA-related proteins","HeteSim measure","performances of networks","proposed method","effective computational method","regulation of cellular biological processes","AUC score","relatedness score","previous methods","Massive studies","existing state-of-the-art approaches","binding","long non-coding RNAs","different connectivity density","information implicit","leave","SVM classifier","effectiveness","validation test","limitations","results"],"language":"en"},

While the formation of alphaviral nucleocapsid cores, consisting of cargo nucleic acid and the viral capsid protein, is an essential molecular process of infection, the precise interactions between the two partners are ill-defined. A CLIP-seq approach was used to screen for candidate sites of interaction between the viral Capsid protein and genomic RNA of Sindbis virus (SINV), a model alphavirus. The data presented in this report indicates that the SINV capsid protein binds to specific viral RNA sequences in the cytoplasm of infected cells, but its interaction with genomic RNA in mature extracellular viral particles is largely non-specific in terms of nucleotide sequence. Mutational analyses of the cytoplasmic viral RNA-capsid interaction sites revealed a functional role for capsid binding early in infection. Interaction site mutants exhibited decreased viral growth kinetics; however, this defect was not a function of decreased particle production. Rather mutation of the cytoplasmic capsid-RNA interaction sites negatively affected the functional capacity of the incoming viral genomic RNAs leading to decreased infectivity. Furthermore, cytoplasmic capsid interaction site mutants are attenuated in a murine model of neurotropic alphavirus infection. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that the identified cytoplasmic interactions of the viral capsid protein and genomic RNA, while not essential for particle formation, are necessary for genomic RNA function early during infection. This previously unappreciated role of capsid protein during the alphaviral replication cycle also constitutes a novel virulence determinant.","publish_time":"2017-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sokoloski, Kevin J.; Nease, Lauren M.; May, Nicholas A.; Gebhart, Natasha N.; Jones, Claire E.; Morrison, Thomas E.; Hardy, Richard W.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8be33a516142d0fa91dd2355a5d41a5357895188.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5507600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5507600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SINV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral capsid protein","cytoplasmic viral RNA-capsid interaction sites","cytoplasmic capsid-RNA interaction sites","capsid binding","genomic RNA function","cytoplasmic capsid interaction site mutants","specific viral RNA sequences","SINV capsid protein binds","unappreciated role of capsid protein","incoming viral genomic RNAs","genomic RNA of Sindbis virus","candidate sites of interaction","decreased viral growth kinetics","mature extracellular viral particles","identified cytoplasmic interactions","functional role","decreased infectivity","essential molecular process of infection","function of decreased particle production","particle formation","murine model of neurotropic alphavirus infection","model alphavirus","functional capacity","precise interactions","formation of alphaviral nucleocapsid cores","alphaviral replication cycle","cargo nucleic acid","cytoplasm of infected cells","public health","significant threat","novel virulence determinant","defect","study","report","Mutational analyses","terms of nucleotide sequence","global level","partners","CLIP-seq approach","Alphaviruses","findings","data"],"language":"en"},

This is considered as the method of choice for generating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Producing LCLs, although very useful but is very time consuming and troublesome, drives the requirement for quicker and more reliable methods for EBV-driven B-cell transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After successfully production of LCLs, different parameters including temperature, serum concentration, type of culture medium, and CO(2) concentration were evaluated on EBV-transformed B-cells. In this study, we were able to produce LCLs and optimize condition. RESULTS: The best condition for generating LCLs was 37\u00B0C, 5% CO(2), 20% fasting blood sugar, and RPMI 1640. The study results were to establish a reliable method for producing LCLs that can be used to produce immortalized B-cells from almost any sources.

This study aimed to investigate the frequency of MALS and to develop a biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis. METHODS: Patients with infections and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were assigned to one test cohort (n = 3417) and a validation cohort (n = 1704). MALS was diagnosed for patients scoring positive either for the hemophagocytic syndrome score and/or having both hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the predictive value of MALS for 10-day mortality in both cohorts. Ferritin, sCD163, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1) were measured in the blood the first 24 h; ferritin measurements were repeated in 747 patients on day 3. RESULTS: The frequency of MALS was 3.7% and 4.3% in the test and the validation cohort, respectively. In both cohorts, MALS was an independent risk factor for 10-day mortality. A ferritin level above 4420 ng/ml was accompanied by 66.7% and 66% mortality after 28 days, respectively. Ferritin levels above 4420 ng/ml were associated with an increase of IL-6, IL-18, INF-\u03B3, and sCD163 and a decreased IL-10/TNF-\u03B1 ratio, indicating predominance of pro-inflammatory phenomena. Any less than 15% decrease of ferritin on day 3 was associated with more than 90% sensitivity for unfavorable outcome after 10 days. This high mortality risk was also validated in an independent Swedish cohort (n = 109). CONCLUSIONS: MALS is an independent life-threatening entity in sepsis. Ferritin measurements can provide early diagnosis of MALS and may allow for specific treatment.","publish_time":"2017-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kyriazopoulou, Evdoxia; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Norrby-Teglund, Anna; Dimopoulos, Georgios; Pantazi, Aikaterini; Orfanos, Stylianos E.; Rovina, Nikoletta; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Gkavogianni, Theologia; Botsa, Elektra; Chassiou, Eleftheria; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Kontouli, Christina; Chaloulis, Panagiotis; Velissaris, Dimitrios; Savva, Athina; Cullberg, Jonas-Sund\u00E9n; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Gogos, Charalambos; Armaganidis, Apostolos; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J.","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2619cd7c1a20950e064d856344c67d82ad6f8631.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5603161.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MALS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frequency of MALS","patients","decreased IL","increase of IL","ferritin measurements","day mortality","early diagnosis of MALS","Ferritin levels","predictive value of MALS","test cohort","validation cohort","independent Swedish cohort","independent risk factor","high mortality risk","sCD163","cohorts","days","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","TNF-\u03B1 ratio","independent life-threatening entity","hemophagocytic syndrome score","IFN-\u03B3","INF-\u03B3","biomarker of diagnosis","sepsis survival benefit","tumor necrosis factor alpha","predominance of pro-inflammatory phenomena","randomized clinical trial","interleukin","infections","macrophage activation","subanalysis","features","interferon gamma","blockade","hepatobiliary dysfunction","intravascular coagulation","sensitivity","unfavorable outcome","METHODS","blood","CONCLUSIONS","Logistic regression analysis","BACKGROUND","prognosis","specific treatment","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

DCS showed synergic effects on NCI\u2010H460 cell proliferation, colony formation and transplantable tumour growth, which suggested dihydroberberine increases the sensitivity of lung carcinoma to sunitinib. Further studies indicated that DCS down\u2010regulated phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and NF\u2010\u03BAB in NCI\u2010H460 cells and tumours and suppressed the I\u03BAB and COX\u20102 expression.

Inhibition of p38 activation by DCS was a likely contributing factor in IL\u20101 and COX\u20102 down\u2010regulation. Consistent with these results, a genomewide microarray analysis found that DCS induced the expression of cell cycle signal molecules that are known to be affected by JNK and p38.

We then evaluated the utility of this assay as a molecular diagnostic test using 90 plasma or serum samples and 99 urine samples collected from 120 suspected cases of arbovirus infection in the states of Para\u00EDba and Pernambuco, Brazil in 2016. The results of this assay were consistent with those of the reference RT-PCR test. This portable RT-LAMP assay was highly specific for ZIKV, and enable rapid diagnosis of the virus infection. Our results provide new insights into ZIKV molecular diagnostics and may improve preparedness for future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2017-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurosaki, Yohei; Martins, Danyelly Bruneska Gondim; Kimura, Mayuko; Catena, Andriu dos Santos; Borba, Maria Am\u00E9lia Carlos Souto Maior; Mattos, Sandra da Silva; Abe, Haruka; Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; de Lima Filho, Jos\u00E9 Luiz; Yasuda, Jiro","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ef3cd7a4e284ef443c3d10514760c0c446866e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5647432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5647432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzczNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["South America","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infection","portable RT-LAMP assay","detection of ZIKV","ZIKV molecular diagnostics","detected ZIKV strains","reference real time RT-PCR assay","urine samples","serum samples","reference RT-PCR test","virus-spiked serum","results","molecular diagnostic test","number of infants","suspected cases of arbovirus infection","portable device","recent outbreak of Zika virus","enormous number of infections","isothermal amplification","disease","plasma","South America","African genotypes","states of Para\u00EDba","arboviruses","cross-reactivity","unusual increase","preparedness","new insights","microcephaly","reverse transcription loop","rapid diagnosis","Dengue","global concern","Chikungunya viruses","Pernambuco","Brazil","viral RNA","TCID","future outbreaks","utility"],"language":"en"},

Bid was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues of grass carp, but the expression level varied in different tissues. Following grass carp reovirus (GCRV) stimulation in vivo, Bid and apoptosis related genes Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 was up-regulated significantly at the late stage of infection. Moreover, we generated a Bid-deficient rare minnow (Bid(-/-)) to investigate the possible role of Bid in GCRV-triggered apoptosis. We found that the survival time of Bid(-/-) rare minnow after GCRV infection was extended when compared with wild-type fish, the relative copy number of GCRV in Bid(-/-) rare minnow was lower than that in wild-type fish, and the expression level of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 in Bid(-/-) rare minnow were significantly lower than that in the wild-type fish.

Currently, the recommended treatment for patients with high-risk MDS is the methylation agent decitabine (DAC), a drug that can induce the reexpression of silenced tumor suppressor genes. We investigated the effects of DAC treatment on the myeloid MDS cell line SKM-1 and investigated the role of FOXO3A, a potentially tumor-suppressive transcription factor, by silencing its expression prior to DAC treatment. We found that FOXO3A exists in an inactive, hyperphosphorylated form in SKM-1 cells, but that DAC both induces FOXO3A expression and reactivates the protein by reducing its phosphorylation level. Furthermore, we show that this FOXO3A activation is responsible for the DAC-induced differentiation of SKM-1 cells into monocytes, as well as for SKM-1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.

Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. RESULTS: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count \u003C1.5\u00D710(9) cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of \u003C1.69\u00D710(9) cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.","publish_time":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pether, Nicola S.; Brothwood, Jessica L.; van Berkel, Cornelis; Dunwoodie, Elaine H.; Blake, Robert L.; Price, Christopher P.; Jones, Richard G.; Baker, Karl S.; Hall, Geoff","journal":"Pract Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87773b968fb19ed46a80e0d44986bb965fa87cf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5683674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distinct neutrophil count","definitive neutrophil count","neutrophil count correlation","blood count results","derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges","three-part differential count","neutrophil counts","cancer patients","Identification of results","relationship","neutropenia grades","large population of patients","cancer treatments","laboratory analyser","cells","point of care testing system","laboratory reference analyser","diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia","anti-cancer therapies","Use of point","large oncology unit","malignancies","severity of neutropenic complications","specificity","database","absence","frequency","study","differentiation","neutrophils","possibility","negative predictive values","clinical decisions","comparative performance","sensitivity","classification","haematology analysers","METHODS","eosinophils","basophils","accuracy","Multinomial logistic regression","DESIGN","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

E1, E2 and the heterodimer complex E1E2 are candidate vaccine antigens, but are technically challenging to study because of difficulties in producing natively folded proteins by standard protein expression and purification methods. To better comprehend the antigenicity of these proteins, a library of alanine scanning mutants comprising the entirety of E1E2 (555 residues) was created for evaluating the role of each residue in the glycoproteins. The mutant library was probed, by a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay, for binding with the co-receptor CD81, and a panel of 13 human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target continuous and discontinuous epitopes of E1, E2, and the E1E2 complex. Together with the recently determined crystal structure of E2 core domain (E2c), we found that several residues in the E2 back layer region indirectly impact binding of CD81 and mAbs that target the conserved neutralizing face of E2. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the E2 back layer in interacting with the E2 front layer for its biological function. We also identified regions of E1 and E2 that likely located at or near the interface of the E1E2 complex, and determined that the E2 back layer also plays an important role in E1E2 complex formation. The conformation-dependent reactivity of CD81 and the antibody panel to the E1E2 mutant library provides a global view of the influence of each amino acid (aa) on E1E2 expression and folding.

Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Shenglan; Tang, Julian W.; Li, Yuguo","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4acb83c4e07408c4c244a047ee85091c9e0a48ed.json; document_parses/pdf_json/811159783691dd3e398010444f7b1564bc885d08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5750989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["norovirus transmission","airborne transmission","Norovirus infection","alternative fomite transmission routes","particular norovirus outbreak","described norovirus outbreak","similar attack rate distribution patterns","reported attack rate distribution","infection risk distributions","fomite route","investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks","vomit-oral routes","high rate of morbidity","alternative hypothesis","alternative interpretation","development of infection control guidelines","original study","fecal-oral","original evidence","re-analysis","reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns","parameter values","important consideration","hotel restaurant","prevalent condition","waiters","future","square methods approach","significant health issue","representative serving pathways","multi-agent model","paper","recent decades","results"],"language":"en"},

Our study investigated the level of knowledge, perceptions, and media use regarding Ebola. METHODS: In December 2014, an online questionnaire was administered to the Dutch population (n = 526) and Health Care Workers (HCW) (n = 760). RESULTS: The mean knowledge score (range 0\u201315) of HCW (m = 13.3;SD = 1.4) was significantly higher than the general public (m = 10.8;SD = 2.0). No significant difference was found in perceived severity and susceptibility. Perceived fear of the general public (m = 2.5; SD = 0.8) was significantly higher than among HCW (m = 2.4; SD = 0.7). Respondents primarily used television to obtain information. CONCLUSIONS: While Ebola was perceived severe, it did not lead to excessive fear or perceived susceptibility for developing the disease. Nonetheless, our research showed that knowledge with respect to human-to-human transmission is low, while this is crucial to complying with preventive measures.

However, the therapeutic efficiency depends on the proliferation and migration of MSCs. Chemokine receptors are involved in regulating the proliferation and migration to the specific organs of MSCs in different microenvironments. CXC receptor seven (CXCR7), a newly discovered Chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) receptor, has organ specificity for tumour migration. We hypothesized that CXCR7 expression affects proliferation and migration of MSCs. In present study, we constructed long-term and stable mMSCs lines overexpressing and suppressing CXCR7 modifications with lentiviral vectors. The transduction efficiencies, mRNA and protein expression of CXCR7 were significantly regulated. CXCR7 gene overexpression promoted mMSCs proliferation and migration, whereas suppressing CXCR7 had the opposite effect. Additional CXCL12 improved the vertical migration of mMSCs. The overexpression of CXCR7 increased the MSC-secreted CXCL12, VCAM-1, CD44 and MMP2 levels, which contributed to the improvement of mMSC proliferation and migration. Therefore, overexpressing CXCR7 improved the proliferation and migration of mMSCs, which may be attributable to the CXCL12 secreted by MSCs, leading to a positive feedback loop for CXCL12/CXCR7 axis. Our results may provide a potential method for improving the treatment effectiveness of mMSCs by overexpressing CXCR7.","publish_time":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ling; Chen, Jian-Xiao; Zhang, Xi-Wen; Sun, Qin; Yang, Lan; Liu, Airan; Hu, Shuling; Guo, Fengmei; Liu, Songqiao; Huang, Yingzi; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-Bo","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bfb7bbc2e0a4c23f153249508216334a248d279.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5760632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5760632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemokine","CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpressing CXCR7","CXCR7 expression","overexpression of CXCR7","migration of MSCs","CXCR7 modifications","CXCR7 axis","mMSCs proliferation","vertical migration of mMSCs","tumour migration","protein expression of CXCR7","CXCR7 gene overexpression","Additional CXCL12","MSC-secreted CXCL12","improvement of mMSC proliferation","treatment effectiveness of mMSCs","stable mMSCs lines","specific organs of MSCs","CXC receptor","Chemokine receptors","discovered Chemokine ligand","therapy","positive feedback loop","mRNA","VCAM","organ specificity","mesenchymal stem cell","wide variety of clinical domains","potential method","transduction efficiencies","different microenvironments","CD44","MMP2 levels","lentiviral vectors","present study","therapeutic efficiency","results","opposite effect"],"language":"en"},

EV71 causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and has been associated with neurological complications in young children. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its neuropathogenesis has hampered the development of effective therapeutic options. Here, using a two-dimensional proteomics approach combined with mass spectrometry, we have identified a unique panel of host proteins that were differentially and dynamically modulated during EV71 infection of motor-neuron NSC-34 cells, which are found at the neuromuscular junctions where EV71 is believed to enter the central nervous system. Meta-analysis with previously published proteomics studies in neuroblastoma or muscle cell lines revealed minimal overlapping which suggests unique host-pathogen interactions in NSC-34 cells. Among the candidate proteins, we focused our attention on prohibitin (PHB), a protein that is involved in multiple cellular functions and the target of anti-cancer drug Rocaglamide (Roc-A). We demonstrated that cell surface-expressed PHB is involved in EV71 entry into neuronal cells specifically, while membrane-bound mitochondrial PHB associates with the virus replication complex and facilitates viral replication. Furthermore, Roc-A treatment of EV71-infected neuronal cells reduced significantly virus yields. However, the inhibitory effect of Roc-A on PHB in NSC-34 cells was not through blocking the CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway as previously reported. Instead, Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells had lower mitochondria-associated PHB and lower ATP levels that correlated with impaired mitochondria integrity. In vivo, EV71-infected mice treated with Roc-A survived longer than the vehicle-treated animals and had significantly lower virus loads in their spinal cord and brain, whereas virus titers in their limb muscles were comparable to controls. Together, this study uncovers PHB as the first host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 neuropathogenesis and a potential drug target to limit neurological complications.","publish_time":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Too, Issac Horng Khit; Bonne, Isabelle; Tan, Eng Lee; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Alonso, Sylvie","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d98b22c96490966661c90f9c892c717545c5f8fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5764453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mouth Disease","PHB","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 neuropathogenesis","treatment of EV71","EV71 entry","lower virus","EV71-infected mice","treated NSC","infected neuronal cells","EV71 infection of motor","lower mitochondria-associated PHB","virus titers","virus yields","virus replication complex","mitochondrial PHB associates","neuron NSC","inhibitory effect of Roc","unique panel of host proteins","neurological complications","host factor","unique host-pathogen interactions","lower ATP levels","potential drug target","vehicle-treated animals","important neurotropic virus of serious public health concern","viral replication","cell surface","candidate proteins","target of anti-cancer drug Rocaglamide","published proteomics studies","muscle cell lines","two-dimensional proteomics approach","impaired mitochondria integrity","neuroblastoma","minimal overlapping","spinal cord","limb muscles","membrane","multiple cellular functions","mass spectrometry","Meta-analysis","Mouth Disease","brain","CRAF","enterovirus","Hand","Foot","attention","development of effective therapeutic options","close relative of poliovirus","MEK","ERK pathway","controls","mechanisms","young children","prohibitin","central nervous system","limited understanding","neuromuscular junctions","study"],"language":"en"},

In the central nervous system (CNS), CCL5 and its receptors have multiple functions, including promoting neuroinflammation, insulin signaling, neuromodulator of synaptic activity and neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins. Evidence has also suggested that this chemokine may regulate opioid response. The multifunctional profile of CCL5 might correlate with its ability to bind different chemokine receptors, as well as with its unique cellular expression. In this work, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the expression profile of CCL5 mRNA in the adult rat brain and provide evidence of its cellular localization. We have observed that the highest expression of CCL5 mRNA occurs in all major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and cerebral peduncle. In these tracts, CCL5 mRNA was localized in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Astrocytic and microglial expression was also evident in several brain areas including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. Furthermore, using a specific neuronal marker, we observed CCL5 mRNA expression in discrete layers of the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, in the midbrain, CCL5 mRNA co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells of the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that CCL5 might be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system. The expression of CCL5 mRNA and protein, together with its receptors, in selected brain cell populations proposes that this chemokine could be involved in neuronal/glial communication.","publish_time":"2018-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lanfranco, Maria Fe; Mocchetti, Italo; Burns, Mark P.; Villapol, Sonia","journal":"Front Neuroanat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe4829233859c2471b9aa99a1027a1fab44b153c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5770405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCL5 mRNA expression","expression profile of CCL5 mRNA","highest expression of CCL5 mRNA","CCL5 mRNA co-localized","multifunctional profile of CCL5","microglial expression","unique cellular expression","different chemokine receptors","brain areas","cerebral cortex","mesolimbic system","hippocampus","Evidence","adult rat brain","C-C motif","peripheral immune system","central nervous system","selected brain cell populations","cerebral peduncle","cellular localization","major fiber tracts","specific neuronal marker","tyrosine hydroxylase","positive cells","corpus callosum","discrete layers","chemoattractant molecules","ventral tegmental area","neuroprotection","neuromodulator of synaptic activity","insulin","anterior commissure","role","putamen","immunohistochemistry","CNS","multiple functions","fluorescence","neuroinflammation","subset of dopaminergic neurons","ligand","oligodendrocytes","midbrain","ability","protein","situ hybridization","variety of neurotoxins","tactile allodynia","astrocytes","group of chemokines","glial communication","thalamus","opioid response","work"],"language":"en"},

To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (Fc\u03B3Rs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death.

Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoC-scores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. METHODS: The Cobb\u2013Douglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvement-isocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was \u20AC118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was \u20AC436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. RESULTS: The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds (\u2248 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation. CONCLUSION: The model allows determination of the most efficient allocation of the healthcare budget between rotavirus vaccination and bed expansion for improving QoC-scores during the annual epidemic winter seasons.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dort, Thibaut; Schecroun, Nadia; Standaert, Baudouin","journal":"Appl Health Econ Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5fc202cbd1c346056d079c45f0577b767206fc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5797246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5797246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Jessa Hospital"],"locations":["Belgium"],"keyphrases":["QoC-scores","extra beds","addition of extra hospital beds","pediatric beds available","given QoC improvement","existing beds","additional beds","Rotavirus vaccination cost","Jessa Hospital","rotavirus vaccination coverage","target QoC increase","pediatric infectious diseases","bed expansion","pediatric wards","winter period","Douglas model","good hospital bed management threshold","hospital quality of care","better vaccination programs","vaccine coverage","Bed occupancy rates","annual epidemic winter seasons","healthcare budget","daily cost","lowest cost","strategies","minimum budget allocation","budget minimization","combination","improvement-isocurves","vaccine-preventable infectious diseases","efficient allocation","annual population","surge","days","course","Belgium","Hasselt","determination","overcrowded units","function","catchment area","METHODS","Cobb","children","Data","baseline parameter values","poor conditions","workplace","CONCLUSION","study","BACKGROUND","example","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Numerous bioactive constituents of tea were confirmed to possess healthy benefits via the mechanisms of regulating gene expressions or protein activities. However, a complete interacting profile between tea bioactive compounds (TBCs) and their target genes is lacking, which put an obstacle in the study of healthy function of tea. To fill this gap, we developed a database of target genes of TBCs (TBC2target, http://camellia.ahau.edu.cn/TBC2target) based on a pharmacophore mapping approach. In TBC2target, 6,226 interactions between 240 TBCs and 673 target genes were documented. TBC2target contains detailed information about each interacting entry, such as TBC, CAS number, PubChem CID, source of compound (e.g., green, black), compound type, target gene(s) of TBC, gene symbol, gene ID, ENSEMBL ID, PDB ID, TBC bioactivity and the reference. Using the TBC-target associations, we constructed a bipartite network and provided users the global network and local sub-network visualization and topological analyses.

Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC(50), EC(90)) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC(50).

This study found that the condition at intake had the greatest impact on the outcomes of older cats and dogs. Additionally, the application of specialized veterinary care, such as orthopedic surgery or chronic disease maintenance, is discussed as factors that inform higher rates of live outcomes for these senior companion animals. These findings demonstrate that if shelters integrate practices that address the specific needs of ageing companion animals, the live outcomes for this population can increase. ABSTRACT: With advances in veterinary medicine that can increase the lifespan of cats and dogs and the effectiveness of spay/neuter programs in reducing the juvenile population of pets, animal shelters are experiencing an increasing population of older companion animals in their care. The purpose of this study was to assess the factors that inform the outcomes of these older cats and dogs. The sample consisted of 124 cats and 122 dogs that were over the age of 84 months (seven years) who were taken into a shelter over a one-year period. To assess the impact of condition at intake on the outcome for the senior animals, a multinomial logistic regression was performed. These findings indicate that preventative programming that can address the reasons these older animals are surrendered, as well as advancements in specialized medical or behavioral programs for ageing companion animals, may support an increase in live outcomes for older cats and dogs in shelters. Further study is needed to evaluate how the quality of life of older animals is impacted by remaining in the care of shelters rather than being euthanized.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawes, Sloane; Kerrigan, Josephine; Morris, Kevin","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d08ea3b664cb3fce5ee8ff79426b5dc211352bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5867524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5867524/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["older animals","outcomes of older cats","dogs","senior animals","increasing population of older companion animals","senior companion animals","care of shelters","animal shelters","lifespan of cats","specific needs of ageing companion animals","increase","study","higher rates of live outcomes","intake","application of specialized veterinary care","impact of condition","factors","findings","juvenile population of pets","behavioral programs","neuter programs","veterinary medicine","greatest impact","orthopedic surgery","chronic disease maintenance","lower perceived appeal","advancements","practices","multinomial logistic regression","reasons","euthanasia","effectiveness","adoption","preventative programming","ABSTRACT","advances","SIMPLE SUMMARY","quality of life","year period","months","years","purpose","sample"],"language":"en"},

The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Yonghao; Xu, Zhiheng; Liu, Xuesong; Cai, Lihua; Zheng, Haichong; Huang, Yongbo; Zhou, Lixin; Huang, Linxi; Lin, Yun; Deng, Liehua; Li, Jianwei; Chen, Sibei; Liu, Dongdong; Lin, Zhimin; Zhou, Liang; He, Weiqun; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Yimin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f879c69d61f14d7efc51023258d1361bc681d403.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030668","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","SARS-CoV","critical patients","Majority of patients","Wuhan","Guangdong Province","mortality of critical illness","human infection","Conclusions Infection","lymphopenia","onset of illness","high fever","prognosis","Demographic data","pneumonia","intubation","acute respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","common symptoms","laboratory findings","experience","observational study","multiple organ dysfunction","retrospective","comorbidities","general understandings","novel coronavirus","intensive care unit","treatments","elevated lactate dehydrogenase","Methods","clinical features","years","cough","ICUs","Information","Results","Abstract Background","antiviral drugs","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","mean age","septic shock","half","China","total"],"language":"en"},

Design, Setting, Participants Retrospective analysis of 3,301 ICU admissions with respiratory failure admitted to 41 U.S. Intensive Care Units from 2015-19. Independent external validation on 1,175 similar ICU Admissions using identical entry criteria from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH), Washington University from 2016-2019. Main Outcomes TACS was created with 16 readily available predictive variables for risk assessment of hospital mortality 24 hours after ICU Admission and the need for prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation (PAMV) ( \u003E\u003E96 hours) at 24- and 48-hours post ICU admission. Results TACS achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for hospital mortality after 24 hours of 0.80 in the development dataset; 0.81 in the internal validation dataset. At a probability of 50% hospital mortality, positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.55, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.89; sensitivity 22%, specificity 97%. For PAMV after 24 hours, the AUC was 0.84 in the development dataset, 0.81 in the validation dataset. For PAMV after 48 hours, the AUC was 0.82 in the development dataset, 0.78 in the validation dataset. In the external validation the AUC for TACS was 0.76 \u002B/- 0.024.

Clinicians need a more accurate understanding of the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19. Methods: We searched studies reporting clinical characteristics in children with COVID-19 published until March 31, 2020. We screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias and quality of evidence of the included studies. We combined some of the outcomes (symptoms) in a single-arm meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results: Our search retrieved 49 studies, including 25 case reports, 23 case series and one cohort study, with a total of 1667 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. Eighty-three percent of the children were within family clusters of cases, and 19% had no symptoms. At least 7% with digestive symptoms. The main symptoms of children were fever (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39%, 56%) and cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%, 48%).

We aim to predict COVID-19 cases and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across coun- tries to inform policy decision making. Methods: We propose a survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre- symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying reproduction number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to an intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncer- tainty by permutation. Findings: Our model adequately estimated observed daily new cases and could predict the entire disease epidemic using data from the early phase. A fast rate of decline in Rt was observed in China and South Korea. In Italy, Rt decreased at a slower rate and did not change significantly before the nation-wide lockdown and two-weeks after. In the United States (US), there was a significant change in Rt before and after the declaration of national emergency. Interpretation: Adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic is effective in reducing the infection rate.

The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases.

Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation: Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors.

In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables. RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the \u003E11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1. However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage/screening.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thurairatnam, S.; Gawecki, F.; Strangeways, T.; Perks, J.; Santhirapala, V.; Myers, J.; Tighe, H.

Abstract Respiratory viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, are the most importance risk factors for the onset of wheezing in infants and small children. Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing. Changes in the immune response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals are very likely to be the main factors involved in the association between viral infection and asthma.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Garcia, M.

Using single cell RNA profiling (scRNAseq) to assess ACE2 and associated SARS-CoV-2 proteases in healthy living donors (LD) kidneys, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and in kidney injury during viral infection, ACE2 expression was primarily associated with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). ACE2 mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in DKD versus LD, however, ACE2 levels were not altered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. ACE2\u002B expression signatures were defined by differential expression analysis and characterized by Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets, resulting in the identification of network modules induced in ACE2 positive PTEC in DKD and BK virus nephropathy. These ACE2 upregulated cell programs were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing and overlapped significantly with the cellular responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar cellular programs were activated in ACE2-positive PTEC isolated in a urine sample from a COVID19 patient with acute kidney injury, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated expression program that may interact with SARS-Cov-2 infection processes. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor associated gene signatures could seed further research into therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Functional networks of gene expression signatures are available for further exploration to researchers at HumanBase (hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney).","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menon, R.; Otto, E.

Wild-type tailspike protein and three mutants (D392N, D395N, and E359Q) with defective endorhamnosidase activity were used. Oligosaccharide binding to all three subunits, measured by a tryptophan fluorescence quench or by fluorescence depolarization of a coumarin label attached to the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide, occurs independently. At 10 degrees C, the binding affinities of all four proteins to oligosaccharides from both bacterial strains are identical within experimental error, and the binding constants for octa- and dodecasaccharides are 1 x 10(6) M(-1) and 2 x 10(6) M(-1), proving that two O-antigen repeats are sufficient for lipopolysaccharide recognition by the tailspike. Equilibration with the oligosaccharides occurs rapidly, but the endorhamnosidase produces only one cleavage every 100 s at 10 degrees C or about 2 min(-1) at the bacterial growth temperature. Thus, movement of virions in the lipopolysaccharide layer before DNA injection may involve the release and rebinding of individual tailspikes rather than hydrolysis of the O-antigen.","publish_time":"1996-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baxa, U; Steinbacher, S; Miller, S; Weintraub, A; Huber, R; Seckler, R","journal":"Biophys J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d5e48dbb2f37918b0d8007a8197f465b54845c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1233670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Receptor binding","Salmonella lipopolysaccharide","O-antigen repeats of Salmonella enteritidis","repetitive O-antigen structure","binding constants","binding affinities","Oligosaccharide binding","receptor-inactivating endorhamnosidase activity","lipopolysaccharide layer","lipopolysaccharide recognition","soluble tailspikes","defective endorhamnosidase activity","individual tailspikes","homotrimeric tailspikes","oligosaccharides","octa","degrees C","dodecasaccharides","Wild-type tailspike protein","Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharides","cell surface receptor","fluorescence depolarization","bacterial strains","tryptophan fluorescence quench","bacterial growth temperature","experimental error","coumarin label","E359Q","mutants","D392N","proteins","DNA injection","reducing end","D395N","release","subunits","hydrolysis","Bacteriophage P22","movement of virions","cleavage","Equilibration"],"language":"en"},

In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD4(\u002B) and CD8\u002B T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.","publish_time":"2002-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viuff, Birgitte; Tj\u00F8rneh\u00F8j, Kirsten; Larsen, Lars E.; R\u00F8ntved, Christine M.; Uttenthal, \u00C5se; R\u00F8nsholt, Leif; Alexandersen, Soren","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory epithelial cells","T cells","Human respiratory syncytial virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","Replication of BRSV","BRSV-infected epithelial cells","model of respiratory syncytial virus infection","upper respiratory tract","lower respiratory tract","Neighboring cells","BRSV-infected apoptotic cells","experimental BRSV infection","important cause of severe respiratory disease","primary infection","course of infection","important aspects of viral replication","important way of clearance","calves","apoptosis","bronchi","indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell","mediated cytotoxicity","infections","young children","elderly","neutrophils","natural target animal","pneumovirus","epidemiological characteristics","CD8","study","lumen","CD4","immunocompromised adults","viruses","number"],"language":"en"},

Biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these hybrid genes were correctly expressed in eukaryotic cells and that the hybrid proteins were transported to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport to the Golgi complex of G protein with an immunoglobulin mu membrane cytoplasmic domain was approximately sixfold slower than G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain. However, this rate was virtually identical to the rate of transport of micron heavy chain molecules measured in the B cell line WEHI 231. The rate of transport of G protein with a hemagglutinin cytoplasmic domain was threefold slower than wild type G protein and G protein with a p23 cytoplasmic domain, which were transported at similar rates. The combined results underscore the importance of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain for efficient transport of G protein to the cell surface.

Both proteins contain a single transmembrane-spanning segment but are integrated in the membrane with opposite orientations. The G protein has an amino-terminal signal sequence and a stop-transfer sequence located near the carboxy terminus. The HN glycoprotein has a single sequence near the amino terminus that functions as both a signal- sequence and a transmembrane-spanning segment. Membrane insertion was explored using a cell-free system directed by transcribed mRNAs encoding amino-terminal segments of the two proteins. Ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides were assembled, ribonucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography, and the ribosomes were incubated with microsomal membranes under conditions of defined ribonucleotide content. Nascent chain insertion into the membrane required the presence of both the signal recognition particle and a functional signal recognition particle receptor. In the absence of ribonucleotides, insertion of nascent membrane proteins was not detected. GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues promoted efficient insertion, while ATP was comparatively ineffective.

Ribosome-associated HN nascent chains remained competent for membrane insertion, while free HN chains were not competent. We conclude that a GTP binding protein performs an essential function during ribosome-dependent insertion of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum that is unrelated to protein synthesis.","publish_time":"1988-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d256d493f1987779fa7f2b417941d497bed6b878.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","GTP","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Membrane insertion","insertion of nascent membrane proteins","ribosome-dependent insertion of membrane proteins","membrane integration","Nascent chain insertion","signal- sequence","Ribosome-associated HN nascent chains","efficient insertion","HN glycoprotein","amino-terminal signal sequence","free HN chains","single sequence","nascent polypeptides","GTP binding protein","protein synthesis","amino terminus","functional signal recognition particle receptor","G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus","stop-transfer sequence","amino-terminal segments","absence of ribonucleotides","nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues","glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus","carboxy terminus","ribonucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis","cell-free system","conditions of defined ribonucleotide content","essential function","transcribed mRNAs","early events","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","endoplasmic reticulum","microsomal membranes","ribosomes","presence","gel filtration chromatography","ATP","requirement","puromycin treatment","majority","opposite orientations"],"language":"en"},

Prior work demonstrated that the 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention and that mutant or overexpressed DPAP A no longer retained in the Golgi was delivered directly to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts, C. J., S. F. Nothwehr, and T. H. Stevens. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:69-83). Replacement of the DPAP A transmembrane domain with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence did not affect either Golgi retention of DPAP A or vacuolar delivery of the retention-defective form of DPAP A. These results indicate that the DPAP A transmembrane domain is not involved in either Golgi retention or targeting of this membrane protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A indicated that the most important elements for retention were within the eight residue stretch 85-92. A 10-amino acid region from DPAP A (81- 90) was sufficient for Golgi retention of alkaline phosphatase, a type II vacuolar membrane protein. Detailed mutational analysis within this 10-amino acid sufficient region demonstrated that a Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp motif was absolutely required for efficient retention. The efficiency of Golgi retention via the DPAP A signal could be diminished by overexpression of wild type but not retention-defective versions of Kex2p, another late Golgi membrane protein, suggesting that multiple Golgi membrane proteins may be retained by a common machinery.

Deletion analysis identified an 11-amino acid segment containing the critical sequence, YQRL, as being sufficient for TGN localization. TGN localization was abrogated by mutation of the tyrosine or leucine residues in this sequence to alanine, or of the arginine residue to aspartate. In addition to specifying TGN localization, the 11-amino acid segment was active as an internalization signal, although the property of internalization alone was insufficient to confer TGN localization. Overexpression of chimeric proteins containing TGN localization determinants resulted in their detection at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, and abolished detection of endogenous TGN38.

The MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities with the rough ER as well as with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack. It also labeled with p58 and rab2, two markers of the intermediate compartment, and with PDI, usually considered to be a marker of the rough ER. The membranes of the budding compartment, as well as the budding virions themselves, but not the rough ER, labeled with the N-acetyl- galactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin Helix pomatia. When the SLO- permeabilized cells were treated with guanosine 5\u0027-(3-O- thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), the budding compartment accumulated a large number of beta-cop-containing buds and vesicular profiles. Complementary biochemical experiments were carried out to determine whether vesicular transport was required for the newly synthesized M protein, that contains only O-linked oligosaccharides, to acquire first, GalNAc and second, the Golgi modifications galactose and sialic acid. The results from both in vivo studies and from the use of SLO- permeabilized cells showed that, while GalNAc addition occurred under conditions which block vesicular transport, both cytosol and ATP were prerequisites for the M protein oligosaccharides to acquire Golgi modifications. Collectively, our data argue that transport from the rough ER to the Golgi complex requires only one vesicular transport step and that the intermediate compartment is a specialized domain of the endoplasmatic reticulum that extends to the first cisterna on the cis side of the Golgi stack.","publish_time":"1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe6e8c22714c1484434a2b5b334bedf7f216739.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Helix","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intermediate compartment","rough ER","ER-Golgi boundary","Golgi complex","Golgi stack","MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities","Golgi modifications galactose","vesicular transport step","budding virions","SLO- permeabilized cells","vesicular profiles","buds","pleomorphic membrane structures","GalNAc addition","O- thio","streptolysin O","use of SLO","protein oligosaccharides","O-linked oligosaccharides","Mouse hepatitis coronavirus","cop","GTP gamma S","features","galactosamine","triphosphate","specialized domain","large number of beta","ATP","specific lectin Helix pomatia","prerequisites","sialic acid","N-acetyl","cytosol","markers","conditions","endoplasmatic reticulum","studies","rab2","permeabilization","cisternal elements","Complementary biochemical experiments","p58","guanosine","data","PDI","membranes","results"],"language":"en"},

We have also shown that Rer1p, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Sec12p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rer1p. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rer1p. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there. From these observations, we conclude that the TMD mainly acts as the retrieval signal and the cytoplasmic domain contains the retention signal.

N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 can express 11 isoforms of these adhesins, called opacity-related (Opa) proteins. Each MS11 Opa protein recognizes a distinct spectrum of CD66 receptors. CD66\u2013Opa binding is mediated by the NH(2)-terminal domain of the receptor and occurs through protein\u2013protein interactions. In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the CD66 and Opa protein families by mapping amino acids in CD66 receptors that determine Opa protein binding. We performed homologue scanning mutagenesis between CD66e, which binds multiple Opa variants, and CD66b, which binds none, and tested both loss-of-function by CD66e and gain-of-function by CD66b in solution assays and in assays involving full-length receptors expressed by epithelial cells. We found that three residues in the CD66e N-domain are required for maximal Opa protein receptor activity. Opa proteins that recognize the same spectrum of native CD66 molecules showed differential binding of receptors with submaximal activity, indicating that the binding characteristics of these Opa proteins are actually slightly different. These data provide a first step toward resolving the structural requirements for Opa\u2013CD66 interaction.","publish_time":"1999-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bos, Martine P.; Hogan, Daniel; Belland, Robert J.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8ece7a7ece002e0a2fcdb9be3f1a85194079c1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2195581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2195581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Opa binding","Opa protein binding","Opa proteins","MS11 Opa protein","Opa protein families","maximal Opa protein receptor activity","CD66 interaction","multiple Opa variants","distinct spectrum of CD66 receptors","differential binding of receptors","protein interactions","full-length receptors","family of CD66 antigens","binding characteristics","spectrum of native CD66 molecules","epithelial cells","CD66e N-domain","function","CD66b","adhesins","solution assays","submaximal activity","terminal domain","gonorrhoeae strain MS11","amino acids","human neutrophils","isoforms","structural requirements","opacity-related","gain","NH","step","mutagenesis","residues","immunoglobulin","molecular basis","pathogenic Neisseriae","homologue","loss","data","report"],"language":"en"},

We have studied the association of the viral membrane glycoproteins M and S in the formation of the virion envelope. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrated that the M and S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) interact specifically forming heteromultimeric complexes in infected cells. These could be detected only when the detergents used for their solubilization from cells or virions were carefully chosen: a combination of nonionic (NP-40) and ionic (deoxycholic acid) detergents proved to be optimal. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that newly made M and S proteins engaged in complex formation with different kinetics. Whereas the M protein appeared in complexes immediately after its synthesis, newly synthesized S protein did so only after a lag phase of \u003E 20 min. Newly made M was incorporated into virus particles faster than S, which suggests that it associates with preexisting S molecules. Using the vaccinia virus T7-driven coexpression of M and S we also demonstrate formation of M/S complexes in the absence of other coronaviral proteins. Pulse-chase labelings and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that M and S associate in pre-Golgi membranes because the unglycosylated form of M appeared in M/S complexes rapidly. Since no association of M and S was detected when protein export from the ER was blocked by brefeldin A, stable complexes most likely arise in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment. Sucrose velocity gradient analysis showed the M/S complexes to be heterogeneous and of higher order, suggesting that they are maintained by homo- and heterotypic interactions. M/S complexes colocalized with alpha-mannosidase II, a resident Golgi protein. They acquired Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications but were not detected at the cell surface. Thus, the S protein, which on itself was transported to the plasma membrane, was retained in the Golgi complex by its association with the M protein. Because coronaviruses bud at pre-Golgi membranes, this result implies that the envelope glycoprotein complexes do not determine the site of budding. Yet, the self-association of the MHV envelope glycoproteins into higher order complexes is indicative of its role in the sorting of the viral membrane proteins and in driving the formation of the viral lipoprotein coat in virus assembly.","publish_time":"1995-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/649b681845a59b87d339917c75ef51c6c55b3a46.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2199982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["M/S","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S complexes","S associate","synthesized S protein","preexisting S molecules","heteromultimeric complexes","stable complexes","S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus","resident Golgi protein","Golgi complex","Golgi compartment","higher order complexes","envelope glycoprotein complexes","pre-Golgi membranes","Golgi intermediate compartment","protein export","viral membrane proteins","complex formation","viral membrane glycoproteins","intermediate ER","virus assembly","coronaviral proteins","Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications","virus particles","self-association","MHV envelope glycoproteins","smooth membranes","virion envelope","detergents","coimmunoprecipitation analysis","plasma membrane","viral lipoprotein coat","Pulse-chase labelings","Pulse-chase experiments","vaccinia virus T7-driven coexpression","coimmunoprecipitation analyses","infected cells","coronaviruses bud","site of budding","Sucrose velocity gradient analysis","result","sorting","role","alpha-mannosidase","unglycosylated form","absence","synthesis","deoxycholic acid","different kinetics","NP","virions","solubilization","brefeldin","combination of nonionic","homo","heterotypic interactions","lag phase","cell surface"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed age, sex, and geographic distribution of deaths from different causes and the leading causes of death in Tianjin. RESULTS: The 5 leading causes of death in Tianjin were cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, chronic lower respiratory disease, and injuries and poisoning. Mortality in Tianjin declined from 0.60% in 1999 to 0.48% in 2004. Noncommunicable diseases accounted for more than 80% of all deaths. Infant and maternal mortality in Tianjin were low. Life expectancy of Tianjin residents increased every year but was consistently longer in women. When deaths from the main chronic diseases are not considered, life expectancy lengthens substantially. CONCLUSION: Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in Tianjin, China. China should commit additional resources to supporting chronic disease prevention and control programs, including proven special health promotion projects.","publish_time":"2009-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiexiu; Jiang, Guohong; Wang, Dezheng; Pan, Yi; Boulton, Matthew","journal":"Prev Chronic Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8d17f3628650e4b6ab0d9068e9e25aa26857569.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2774646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tianjin","China"],"keyphrases":["chronic disease prevention","leading causes of death","Life expectancy of Tianjin residents","cerebrovascular disease","cardiovascular disease","leading cause of death","China","chronic lower respiratory disease","main chronic diseases","different causes","trends of major causes of death","all-cause deaths","control programs","geographic distribution of deaths","maternal mortality","Noncommunicable diseases","mortality rates","malignant neoplasm","proven special health promotion projects","injuries","additional resources","sex","year","policies","age","world population","poisoning","METHODS","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","women"],"language":"en"},

For this manuscript we define stress as the physiological responses an individual undergoes while adjusting to a continually changing environment. It is known that stressors of various types (psychological/physical) can alter the physiological levels of certain hormones, chemokines and cytokines. These alterations send information to the central nervous system to take necessary action which then sends messages to appropriate organs/tissues/cells to respond. These messages can either activate or suppress the immune system as needed and failure to compensate for this by the body can lead to serious health-related problems. Little is known how stress affects disease susceptibility, yet understanding this mechanism is important for developing effective treatments, and for improving health and food quality. The current review focuses on (a) the effects of psychological stressors in humans and animals, (b) various methodologies employed to understand stress responses and their outcomes, and (c) the current status of the attempts to correlate stress and disease with respiratory disease as model system. The methodologies included in this review span traditional epidemiological, behavioral and immunological studies to current high throughput genomic, proteomic, metabolomic/metabonomic approaches. With the advent of various newer omics and bioinformatics methodologies we postulate that it will become feasible to understand the mechanisms through which stress can influence disease onset. Although the literature in this area is limited because of the infancy of this research area, the objective of this review is to illustrate the power of new approaches to address complex biological questions. These new approaches will also aid in our understanding how these processes are related to the dynamics and kinetics of changes in expression of multiple genes at various levels.","publish_time":"2009-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aich, Palok; Potter, Andrew A; Griebel, Philip J","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5560c5577076d3180d78439586d9ebe75653b20f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2840576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stress responses","various methodologies","various levels","respiratory disease","current review","disease susceptibility","disease onset","stressors of various types","animals","bioinformatics methodologies","effects of psychological stressors","physiological responses","current status","model system","metabonomic approaches","power of new approaches","immune system","messages","understanding","advent of various newer omics","central nervous system","immunological studies","current high throughput genomic","humans link","physiological levels of certain hormones","research area","serious health-related problems","severity of respiratory infections","increased incidence","metabolomic","expression of multiple genes","necessary action","chemokines","kinetics of changes","appropriate organs","complex biological questions","dynamics","tissues","effective treatments","information","attempts","cells","cytokines","alterations","infancy","objective","outcomes","mechanisms","individual","processes","food quality","body","failure","manuscript","literature","environment"],"language":"en"},

Many studies have investigated the pathways involved in the induction of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 after virus infection and the resultant upregulation of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor complex signaling. However, other than examining the effects of genetic deletion of induction or effector pathway components, little is known regarding the functionality of these responses in intact hosts and whether host genetic or environmental factors might influence their potency. Here, we demonstrate that the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 response against multiple arthropod-vectored viruses, which replicate over a wide temperature range, is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, exhibiting reduced antiviral efficacy at subnormal cellular temperatures and increased efficacy at supranormal temperatures. The effect involves both IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and ISG upregulation pathways with a major aspect of altered potency reflecting highly temperature-dependent transcription of IFN response genes that leads to altered IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and ISG protein levels. Discordantly, signaling steps prior to transcription that were examined showed the opposite effect from gene transcription, with potentiation at low temperature and inhibition at high temperature. Finally, we demonstrate that by lowering the temperature of mice, chikungunya arbovirus replication and disease are exacerbated in an IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-dependent manner. This finding raises the potential for use of hyperthermia as a therapeutic modality for viral infections and in other contexts such as antitumor therapy.

Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer. Pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that all four antibodies could potently protect host cells from virus infection. Overall, we isolated multiple formats of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies via site-directed antibody screening, which could be promising candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiaoyu; Gao, Fang; Gou, Liming; Chen, Yin; Gu, Yayun; Ao, Lei; Shen, Hongbing; Hu, Zhibin; Guo, Xiling; Gao, Wei","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3be35e7c80726ed84fd072197d5ec6d31e3467e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074914","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pseudovirus"],"organizations":["IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralizing antibodies","authentic SARS-CoV","domain antibodies","interaction of SARS","neutralizing antibody screening","ACE2 interface of SARS","RBD","domain antibody 4A12","IgG antibody","multiple formats of SARS","ACE2-interfaces","ACE2-positive cells","host cells","virus infection","4A3","site","S1 receptor-binding domain","acute pathogenic infection","spike homotrimer","surface spike glycoprotein","prevention","targeting epitope","promising candidate drugs","effective interventions","phage display","neutralization assays","specific vaccines","angiotensin","4D5","capabilities","treatment of COVID","best accessibility","enzyme","Pseudovirus","current study","4A10","people"],"language":"en"},

Optimized conditions for the process of biodiesel production by MRL were investigated by the response surface methodology (RSM) and the Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimized conditions for biodiesel production by MRL were as follows. The molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4.0, water content was 1.5 % as oil weight, the dosage of MRL to oil was 9.0 % (W/W) under 41 \u00B0C for 28 h. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of FAMEs by MRL reached 82.20 %. Further experiments showed that the MRL could be used 10 cycles and the yield of FAMEs decreased slightly by 10.97 %.

We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2.

We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500.

In this situation, we develop a model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission by using data of four countries - United States, Australia, Canada and China. Methods The model underlies that higher the population density, higher the risk of transmission of infectious disease from human to human. Besides, population size, case identification rate and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model. Results According to the calculated risk index, our study identifies New York State in United States (US) to be the most vulnerable area affected by the novel Coronavirus.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between Compute Tomography (CT)-based measurements of visceral and subcutaneous fat as measures of obesity and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: 30 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a mean age of 65.59 plus/minus 13.06 years from a level one medical center in Berlin, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed and included in the present analysis. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from throat swaps or deep nasal swabs on the day of admission. Severe clinical courses of COVID-19 were defined by hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients received low-dose chest CT-based fat measurements at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. RESULTS: An increase in visceral fat area (VFA) by one square decimeter was associated with a 22.53-fold increased risk for ICU treatment and a 16.11-fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation (adjusted for age and sex). For upper abdominal circumference, each additional centimeter of circumference showed a 1.13-fold increased risk for ICU treatment and a 1.25-fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation. There was no significant correlation of subcutaneous fat area (SFA) or body mass index (BMI) with severe clinical courses of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference specifically increasing the risk of COVID-19 severity. CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference in routinely acquired chest CTs may therefore be a simple tool for risk assessment in SARS-CoV-2-patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, A.; Bressem, K.; Albrecht, J.; Thiess, H.-M.; Vahldiek, J.; Hamm, B.; Makowski, M.; Niehues, A.; Niehues, S.; Adams, L.

Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of \u223C20 \u00B5M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China. Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran\u0027s I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the \u201CWuhan lockdown\u201D. The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran\u0027s I value was not significant.

Summary Lactic acidosis is a recognized event in adult patients with acute severe asthma (ASA). Only a few cases have been reported in children. Hereinafter is reported the case of a 2-year-old girl hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit for ASA, which was treated with high-flow oxygen therapy and intravenous methylprednisolone and salbutamol. During hospitalization, she had metabolic acidosis with a 7.29 pH, a 26mmHg hypocapnia, and a decrease in bicarbonates to 12 mmol/L. The anion gap was increased to 20 mmol/L and lactates to 8 mmol/L. The work-up for a congenital metabolic disease was normal.

The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Joe; Keeling, Matt J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2536b83acf84368d7c13be81fe07aa0575115da7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Eastern Europe","Africa","Central America","South-Western Asia"],"keyphrases":["country-specific basic reproductive ratio","synthetic age","ratio of children","age-dependent susceptibility","age-structured transmission","China","network of contacts","R0","contact network","global spread","multiplicative scaling","Africa","step","Central America","Japan","Eastern Europe","population","matrices","observed propensity of clinical cases","large numbers","socio-demographics","older adults","COVID","South-Western Asia","potential","data","public-health planning","household composition","outbreak of novel coronavirus","elderly","value","disease","nature of pathogen","countries","pattern"],"language":"en"},

Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. Objective: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. Methods: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, amount of viral shedding, and 30-day mortality. Results: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: pending.

Design Epidemiological observational study. Setting Two large hospitals and 40 territorial healthcare units, with a total of 5700 workers. Participants 143 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NF) swab in a population made of 5,700 HCWs. Main outcome measures Clinical data on the history of exposure, contacts inside and outside of the hospital, NF swab dates and results. A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia). Results Most workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days. Conclusion HCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection.

However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world.

Within the small intestinal epithelium, adult stem cells integrate diverse signals to regulate regeneration and differentiation, thereby establishing overall cellularity. Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a pan-epithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000-fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance. In total, we provide a framework to identify novel biological cues and therapeutic leads to rebalance intestinal stem cell differentiation and modulate epithelial tissue composition via high-throughput phenotypic screening in rationally-designed organoid model of differentiation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mead, Benjamin E.; Hattori, Kazuki; Levy, Lauren; Vukovic, Marko; Sze, Daphne; Matute, Juan D.; Duan, Jinzhi; Langer, Robert; Blumberg, Richard S.; Ordovas-Montanes, Jose; Shalek, Alex K.; Karp, Jeffrey M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.063727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal stem cell differentiation","Paneth cell differentiation","Paneth cell abundance","adult intestinal stem cells","organoid model of differentiation","adult stem cells","small intestinal epithelium","Notch differentiation cues","stem cell fate commitment","epithelial composition","intestinal progenitors","throughput phenotypic organoid screen","epithelial tissue composition","cell-type specific","novel biological cues","biological targets","secretory Paneth","abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT","quality of specialized cells","cellular composition","physiological cues of","associated changes","small molecule inhibitors","high-throughput phenotypic screening","organoid culture system","thousands of samples","ability","novel therapeutic candidates","Barrier tissue epithelia","therapeutic leads","pan-epithelial stress response","pharmacological agents","tractable approach","nuclear exporter Xpo1","oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT","rigorous approaches","diverse signals","causal testing of disease","essential role","scalable assay","automated plating","regeneration","hematologic malignancies","lack of suitable tools","organismal homeostasis","interruption of mitogen","doses","goblet","framework","kind","enteroendocrine populations","multiple human diseases","overall cellularity","observation","search","total"],"language":"en"},

It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in \u223C3-5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by \u223C10-15-fold compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 S-protein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing \u003E400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-protein-interacting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I variant, part of a consensus NxS/T N-glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90 glycosylation in immunity from non-human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Overall, ACE2 variants are rare, consistent with the lack of selection pressure given the recent history of SARS-CoV epidemics, however, are likely to play an important role in altering susceptibility to CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stawiski, Eric W.; Diwanji, Devan; Suryamohan, Kushal; Gupta, Ravi; Fellouse, Frederic A.; Sathirapongsasuti, J.

As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing. Methods: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting. Results: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window. Conclusions: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Long, D.

Despite this outstanding safety profile, the occurrence of spontaneously-generated large plaque-forming virulent LC16m8 revertants following passage in cell culture is a major drawback. We identified the gene responsible for the reversion and deleted the gene (B5R) from LC16m8 to derive LC16m8\u0394.

Investigations characterizing the poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from contact birds (\u201Csentinels\u201D) placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the poultry and avian gut, and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry performance in general have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has provided insight into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and virus communities that warrant further study in order to understand their role(s) in avian gut health and disease.","publish_time":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, J.

A substantial proportion of all human populations studied to date have MBL deficiency due to MBL2 polymorphisms, which potentially increases susceptibility to infectious disease. MBL binds numerous respiratory pathogens but the capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae abrogates its efficient binding. Clinical studies in humans have shown that MBL deficiency appears to predispose to severe respiratory tract infection. A recent meta-analysis shows that MBL deficiency was associated with death in patients with pneumococcal infection after adjusting for bacteraemia and comorbidities. Human clinical studies have also shown associations between MBL deficiency and various less common respiratory infections. Intracellular infections like tuberculosis may be less common with MBL deficiency because of reduced opsonophagocytosis. Lung secretions contain small amounts of MBL that are potentially sufficient to activate complement, but their measurement is confounded by dilution inherent in collection techniques. Therefore, if this protein does play a role in pulmonary immunity it is presumably through prevention of haematogenous dissemination of respiratory pathogens while adding to mucosal defences. Ficolins are collectins that are structurally and functionally related to MBL and are either present in serum or expressed in tissues including the lung. Limited variation in serum levels of L- and H-ficolin result from the presence of FCN2 and FCN3 polymorphisms. Initial studies on the impact of FCN2 polymorphisms or low L-ficolin levels do not seem to show major associations with respiratory infection. MBL is being developed as a new immunotherapeutic agent for prevention of infection in immunocompromised hosts. The available literature suggests that it may also be of benefit in MBL deficient patients with severe pneumonia. This review concentrates on clinical associations between MBL deficiency and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection.","publish_time":"2009-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eisen, Damon P.","journal":"J Innate Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c67239a4b227059232bd11e85d7a30e06700c752.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375630/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000228159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MBL deficiency","MBL deficient patients","small amounts of MBL","severe respiratory tract infection","prevention of infection","common respiratory infections","numerous respiratory pathogens","clinical associations","pneumococcal infection","Human clinical studies","prevention of haematogenous dissemination of respiratory pathogens","susceptibility","impact of FCN2 polymorphisms","major associations","MBL2 polymorphisms","ficolin levels","FCN3 polymorphisms","serum levels","Initial studies","presence of FCN2","human populations","severe pneumonia","efficient binding","complement activation","Lung secretions","Intracellular infections","H-ficolin result","Mannose-binding lectin","innate immune system pattern recognition protein","wide range of pathogenic microbes","capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae","date","death","new immunotherapeutic agent","review concentrates","dilution inherent","tuberculosis","benefit","recent meta-analysis","reduced opsonophagocytosis","humans","pulmonary immunity","immunocompromised hosts","collection techniques","role","substantial proportion","tissues","Limited variation","bacteraemia","mucosal defences","measurement","infectious disease","comorbidities","Ficolins","collectins","available literature"],"language":"en"},

CFTR is normally expressed in ciliated epithelial cells of the surface and submucosal gland ductal epithelium and submucosal gland acinar cells. Critical questions for the development of gene transfer strategies for CF airway disease are what airway regions require CFTR function and how many epithelial cells require CFTR expression to restore normal ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to CF airway epithelium? An in vitro model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium (CF HAE) was used to test whether a human parainfluenza virus (PIV) vector engineered to express CFTR (PIVCFTR) could deliver sufficient CFTR to CF HAE to restore mucus transport, thus correcting the CF phenotype. PIVCFTR delivered CFTR to \u003E60% of airway surface epithelial cells and expressed CFTR protein in CF HAE approximately 100-fold over endogenous levels in non-CF HAE. This efficiency of CFTR delivery fully corrected the basic bioelectric defects of Cl(\u2212) and Na(\u002B) epithelial ion transport and restored ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to levels approaching those of non-CF HAE. To determine the numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells required to express CFTR for restoration of mucus transport to normal levels, different amounts of PIVCFTR were used to express CFTR in 3%\u201365% of the surface epithelial cells of CF HAE and correlated to increasing ASL volumes and mucus transport rates. These data demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that restoration of normal mucus transport rates in CF HAE was achieved after CFTR delivery to 25% of surface epithelial cells. In vivo experimentation in appropriate models will be required to determine what level of mucus transport will afford clinical benefit to CF patients, but we predict that a future goal for corrective gene transfer to the CF human airways in vivo would attempt to target at least 25% of surface epithelial cells to achieve mucus transport rates comparable to those in non-CF airways.","publish_time":"2009-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Liqun; Button, Brian; Gabriel, Sherif E.; Burkett, Susan; Yan, Yu; Skiadopoulos, Mario H.; Dang, Yan Li; Vogel, Leatrice N.; McKay, Tristan; Mengos, April; Boucher, Richard C.; Collins, Peter L.; Pickles, Raymond J.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6761d94a9d2827b88e04a42b2e2ddd8036ba410.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2705187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19621064/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","CF HAE","ASL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface epithelial cells of CF HAE","CF airways","CF airway epithelium","non-CF HAE","CF patients","CF phenotype","numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells","restoration of mucus transport","CF airway disease","airway surface epithelial cells","decreased mucus transport","level of mucus transport","CF human airways","epithelial ion transport","mucus transport rates comparable","CFTR expression","CFTR protein","CFTR function","sufficient CFTR","Dysfunction of CFTR","restoration of normal mucus transport rates","mucus dehydration","ciliated epithelial cells","model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium","normal regulation of ion transport","efficiency of CFTR delivery","reduced volume of airway surface liquid","airway regions","normal ASL volume regulation","normal levels","submucosal gland acinar cells","restored ASL volume regulation","ASL volumes","submucosal gland ductal epithelium","endogenous levels","corrective gene transfer","human parainfluenza virus","different amounts of PIVCFTR","development of gene transfer strategies","vector","cystic fibrosis","fold","clinical benefit","future goal","knowledge","basic bioelectric defects","Critical questions","experimentation","appropriate models","time","data"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we may speculate that the different hormonal milieu could have a more profound pathophysiological role in association with SARS-CoV-2, with endogenous testosterone leaving men more prone to develop more serious complications related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another option is that SARS-CoV-2 infection per se causes an acute stage of male hypogonadism, the depletion of androgenic action triggering serious or an even fatal course of the disease.

Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-\u03B3 release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. RESULTS: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-\u03B3 after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-\u03B3 after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-\u03B3-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-\u03B3 concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-\u03B3 production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-\u03B3 concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-\u03B3 after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity. The association of this assay to serological and molecular tests provides a better estimate of cat exposure to L. infantum.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Priolo, Vito; Mart\u00EDnez-Orellana, Pamela; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Masucci, Marisa; Prandi, David; Ippolito, Dorotea; Bruno, Federica; Castelli, Germano; Solano-Gallego, Laia","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43fd9e9fa6ecb2ec700c15288e7e3c7ba38f26a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6434818.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3386-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909952/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LSA","PCR"],"locations":["Sicily","Catalonia"],"keyphrases":["LSA-IFN","infantum infection","IFN-\u03B3 concentrations","\u03B3-producer cats","ConA-IFN","infantum antibody negative","Leishmania infantum","\u03B3 release","\u03B3 production","tested cats","majority of cats","specific IFN-\u03B3 concentration results","stimulation","PCR-positive","infantum soluble antigen","feline cell","blood assay","immune response specific","blood PCR positivity","endemic areas","adaptive immune response","antibody levels","PCR testing","Feline leishmaniosis","feline leukemia virus","feline immunodeficency virus","immunofluorescence antibody test","blood parasite load","ELISA","IFAT","serology","association","Significant positive correlations","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","FIV status","subclinical infections","retroviral infections","better estimate of cat exposure","molecular tests","rare disease","polymerase chain reaction","host species","key role","course of","FeLV","interferon","concanavalin","BACKGROUND","Sicily","study","Catalonia","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

There is compelling evidence that the primary immunoevasive strategy utilized by the SARS virus, like influenza, is to inhibit its host\u0027s corticosteroid stress response. This is accomplished by viral expression of amino acid sequences that are molecular mimics of the host\u0027s adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). When the host produces antibodies against these viral antigens, the antibodies also bind to the host\u0027s own ACTH, which limits the host\u0027s stress response by interfering with ACTH\u0027s ability to stimulate the secretion of corticosteroids. This inadequate corticosteroid response provokes symptoms as a result of a relative adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment with corticosteroids can relieve the patient\u0027s symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency and give them the corticosteroid levels needed to fight their infection. Similarly, by taking moderate daily doses of corticosteroids as a prophylactic, it may be possible to avoid clinical infection with SARS. If SARS\u0027s ACTH mimic strategy never has an opportunity to get started, SARS\u0027s ability to evade its host\u0027s immune system while its viral load is low will be significantly impaired. In this article, amino acid sequences from the SARS and influenza viruses representing likely homology to human ACTH are identified.

In 2007-2008, three outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea occurred in adult cows at three dairy farms in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. BToV was the only enteric pathogen detected in these outbreaks, as determined by electron microscopy, reverse transcription-PCR, bacteria and parasite tests of fecal samples, and antibody tests with paired sera. The epidemiological features of the three outbreaks were similar to those of bovine coronavirus infection, except for the absence of bloody diarrhea, with diarrhea spreading among most adult cows, but not in calves, within several days and diarrhea lasting for 3-5 days with anorexia. Decreased milk production and mild respiratory symptoms were also observed in two of the outbreaks. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the BToV nucleocapsid, spike, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes revealed a close relatedness among the detected BToV strains from each outbreak and those of Japanese BToV strain Aichi/2004. Furthermore, we isolated a BToV strain, designated Niigata (TC), from a fecal sample using a human rectal tumor cell line. Sequence analysis of this isolate and Aichi/2004 indicated that both strains have truncated HE genes with deletions in the 3\u2032 region that occurred through cell culture-adaptation. The short projections that are believed to be formed by the HE protein on virus particles were not observed in these cultured strains by electron microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that BToV causes epidemic diarrhea in adult cows and should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in adult cows. In addition, our findings indicate that the HE protein of BToV may not be necessary for viral replication.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aita, Tsunehiko; Kuwabara, Masaki; Murayama, Kazunori; Sasagawa, Yuri; Yabe, Shizuka; Higuchi, Ryohei; Tamura, Tsutomu; Miyazaki, Ayako; Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7df7f4e05288324ddcd529d238d9295e9700d730.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087103.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1183-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["adult cows","protein of BToV","BToV nucleocapsid","outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea","detected BToV strains","Japanese BToV strain Aichi","absence of bloody diarrhea","differential diagnosis of diarrhea","electron microscopy","cultured strains","enteric pathogen of calves","genes","days","Nucleotide sequence analysis","parasite tests of fecal samples","antibody tests","epidemiological characterization","Niigata Prefecture","designated Niigata","epidemiological features","Bovine torovirus","bovine coronavirus infection","cell culture-adaptation","human rectal tumor cell line","bacteria","reverse transcription-PCR","dairy farms","TC","etiological role","Decreased milk production","mild respiratory symptoms","spike","close relatedness","hemagglutinin-esterase","paired sera","region","deletions","isolate","results","virus particles","viral replication","findings","short projections","addition","anorexia"],"language":"en"},

Seven PUPs had not been reported previously, and two of them were predicted to contain transmembrane regions. Eight ORFs partially overlapped with or embedded into those of known genes, revealing that the SARS-CoV genome is a small and compact one with overlapped coding regions.

Using multiple siRNAs that target conserved areas of the genome allows for increased chances of antiviral activity against different viral strains and also helps to prevent the emergence of escape mutants. In this study, four siRNAs were designed to target areas of conserved sequence between divergent strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). A pool of these siRNAs inhibited the replication of all six strains of VEEV tested. A single nucleotide mismatch at the extreme 3\u2032 end of one of the siRNA sense strands did not affect antiviral activity but other mutations were not tolerated. Two strains of VEEV were tested for their abilities to overcome the inhibitory effects of RNA interference following 10 consecutive incubations in the presence of siRNAs. One strain remained susceptible throughout the course of the experiment but the other strain became resistant to the activity of siRNAs. Sequence analysis of the siRNA target sites in this strain showed that no mutations had been generated, indicating that the virus may had become resistant in some other manner.

The protein was overexpressed in E. coli, and the purified Rv0888 protein was found to require divalent cations for activity, with an optimal temperature and pH of 41 \u00B0C and 6.5, respectively. Further results demonstrated that Rv0888 nuclease activity could be inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers. Based on sequence analysis, Rv0888 nuclease exhibited no homology with any known extracellular nucleases, indicating that Rv0888 is a novel nuclease.

Presently, there are no FDA-approved LASV-specific vaccines or antiviral agents, although the antiviral drug ribavirin has shown some efficacy. A recently identified small-molecule inhibitor of arenavirus entry, ST-193, exhibits submicromolar antiviral activity in vitro. To determine the antiviral utility of ST-193 in vivo, we tested the efficacy of this compound in the LASV guinea pig model. Four groups of strain 13 guinea pigs were administered 25 or 80mg/kg ST-193, 25mg/kg of ribavirin, or the vehicle by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route before infection with a lethal dose of LASV, strain Josiah, and continuing once daily for 14 days. Control animals exhibited severe disease, becoming moribund between days 10 and 15 postinfection. ST-193-treated animals exhibited fewer signs of disease and enhanced survival when compared to the ribavirin or vehicle groups. Body temperatures in all groups were elevated by day 9, but returned to normal by day 19 postinfection in the majority of ST-193-treated animals. ST-193 treatment mediated a 2\u20133-log reduction in viremia relative to vehicle-treated controls. The overall survival rate for the ST-193-treated guinea pigs was 62.5% (10/16) compared with 0% in the ribavirin (0/8) and vehicle (0/7) groups. These data suggest that ST-193 may serve as an improved candidate for the treatment of Lassa fever.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cashman, Kathleen A.; Smith, Mark A.; Twenhafel, Nancy A.; Larson, Ryan A.; Jones, Kevin F.; Allen, Robert D.; Dai, Dongcheng; Chinsangaram, Jarasvech; Bolken, Tove\u2019 C.; Hruby, Dennis E.; Amberg, Sean M.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Guttieri, Mary C.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20f9c6acc7badbc25a07a77feca42e1d5938d51f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3319460.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000507; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21371508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["majority of ST","antiviral utility of ST","vehicle groups","treated animals","antiviral drug ribavirin","vehicle-treated controls","treated guinea pigs","groups of strain","antiviral agents","LASV guinea pig model","lethal dose of LASV","submicromolar antiviral activity","treatment of Lassa fever","Control animals","postinfection","efficacy","days","FDA-approved LASV-specific vaccines","severe disease","enhanced survival","strain Josiah","fewer signs of disease","Abstract Lassa virus","overall survival rate","viral hemorrhagic fever endemic","viremia relative","West Africa","compound","small-molecule inhibitor of arenavirus entry","Arenaviridae family","route","member","log reduction","improved candidate","Body temperatures","infections","year","data"],"language":"en"},

An intestinal sample from an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) herd with reoccurring diarrhea and respiratory disease was submitted for next-generation sequencing, revealing the presence of a BoV strain. The alpaca BoV strain (AlBoV) had a 58.58% whole genome nucleotide percent identity to a camel BoV from Dubai, belonging to a tentative ungulate BoV 8 species (UBoV8). Recombination events were lacking with other UBoV strains. The AlBoV genome was comprised of the NS1, NP1, and VP1 proteins. The NS1 protein had the highest amino acid percent identity range (57.89\u201367.85%) to the members of UBoV8, which was below the 85% cut-off set by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The low NS1 amino acid identity suggests that AlBoV is a tentative new species. The whole genome, NS1, NP1, and VP1 phylogenetic trees illustrated distinct branching of AlBoV, sharing a common ancestor with UBoV8. Walker loop and Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motifs that are vital for virus infectivity were identified in NS1 and VP1 proteins, respectively.

HCMV vaccine has emerged as an effective approach to prevent HCMV infection particularly for the development of multiple viral antigens vaccination and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted polyepitope technology. As the Chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide, it is important to develop HCMV vaccines more specific for the Chinese population by targeting Chinese-restricted HLA alleles and antigens. In the present study, we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5F35, which encodes 83 HCMV T cell epitopes from 15 different HCMV antigens, restricted to 14 HLA I and 7 HLA II alleles that cover 92% of the Chinese population. Our results show that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine Ad5F35-CTL\u00B7Th can be efficiently transfected and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with little cytopathic activity. Ad5F35-CTL\u00B7Th can also be endogenously processed and presented by PBMCs. Ad5F35-CTL\u00B7Th-stimulated HCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) showed strong cytolytic activity against HCMV polyepitope-sensitized target cells. The CTL activity was accompanied by high levels of IFN-\u03B3 production after Ad5F35-CTL\u00B7Th stimulation. The specificity and vigorous response to the recombinant adenovirus vaccine in vitro makes it a potential candidate to be used for transplantation recipients or congenitally infected infants.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Ping; Ma, Dao-Xin; Yu, Shuang; Xue, Fu-Zhong; Zhu, Wei-Wei; Shao, Na; Zhang, Jing-Ru; Ji, Chun-Yan","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114286.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211005249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22197248/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211005249; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.12.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV infection","HCMV vaccines","different HCMV antigens","CTL activity","Chinese population","recombinant adenovirus vaccine Ad5F35-CTL","Chinese-restricted HLA alleles","HCMV T cell epitopes","HCMV polyepitope-sensitized target cells","Th-stimulated HCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes","replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5F35","Th stimulation","restricted polyepitope technology","novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine","PBMCs","infected infants","strong cytolytic activity","little cytopathic activity","transplantation recipients","development of multiple viral antigens vaccination","human leukocyte antigen","Abstract Human cytomegalovirus","recipients of organ transplants","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","CTLs","\u03B3 production","high levels of IFN","major cause of morbidity","vigorous response","effective approach","potential candidate","specificity","results","present study"],"language":"en"},

IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. The IBV infection leads to respiratory and nephrogenic symptoms in broiler chickens. In addition, its infection leads to reduced fertility and hatchability in layer birds. We determined the first complete genome sequence of a variant IBV from an outbreak in Haryana state of the Northern part of India using next generation sequencing. On phylogenetic analysis of the IBV isolate, it clustered with genotype I lineage 1 (GI-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of S gene of IBV isolates showed a high level of identity with strains isolated from Tamil Nadu and the reference vaccine strains. Our result suggests that the IBV virus isolated from unvaccinated chicken flocks in North India might be a revertant strain originally evolved from the live attenuated vaccine strains used in the region. Determination of the complete genome sequence of additional IBV isolates from India is necessary to understand the epidemiology of IBV in India.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jakhesara, Subhash J.; Nath, Barnali; Pal, J.

In this study, we investigated the roles of CXCR2 and CXCL1 in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS using a murine model of neuroinflammation. METHODS: Wild-type (WT), CXCL1(\u2212/\u2212), and CXCR2(\u2212/\u2212) mice each received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esterase staining and intravital microscopy were performed to examine neutrophil recruitment to the brain. To assess endothelial activation in these mice, the expression of adhesion molecules was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. To identify the cellular source of functional CXCR2, chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. RESULTS: Expression levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly increased in the brain following the i.c.v. injection of LPS. CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency blocked neutrophil infiltration and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral microvessels. In the CXCR2(\u2212/\u2212) and CXCL1(\u2212/\u2212) mice, the cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin and VCAM-1 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that CXCR2 expression on CNS-residing cells is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. Compared with microglia, cultured astrocytes secreted a much higher level of CXCL1 in vitro. Astrocyte culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cerebral endothelial cells in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Additionally, CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cerebral endothelial cells but not in microglia or astrocytes was increased following tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) stimulation. The intravenous injection of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 significantly inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment to cerebral microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL1 secreted by astrocytes and endothelial CXCR2 play essential roles in cerebral endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation.","publish_time":"2015-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Fengjiao; Zhao, Yawei; Jiao, Tian; Shi, Dongyan; Zhu, Xingxing; Zhang, Mingshun; Shi, Meiqing; Zhou, Hong","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4efe5912760797318110dec69b255d743f0f0bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4438521.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0316-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chemokines"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endothelial CXCR2","CXCR2 expression","roles of CXCR2","cerebral endothelial activation","cerebral endothelial cells","cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules","neutrophil recruitment","cerebral microvessels","chemokines CXCL1","subsequent leukocyte recruitment","CXCR2 antagonist SB225002","CXCR2 messenger RNA","CXCR2-dependent manner","expression of VCAM","CXCL1 deficiency","Expression levels","cellular source of functional CXCR2","immune cell recruitment","CNS","chimeric mice","higher level of CXCL1","bone marrow cells","injection of LPS","essential roles","cultured astrocytes","WT","microglia","intravenous injection","injection of lipopolysaccharide","brain","TNF-\u03B1","neutrophil infiltration","bone marrow transfer experiments","following tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","murine model of neuroinflammation","PCR","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","mRNA","central nervous system","chemokine receptors","ICAM","intravital microscopy","P-selectin","CXCL2","CXCL5","Western blotting","Wild-type","Esterase staining","METHODS","BACKGROUND","stimulation","RESULTS","intracerebroventricular","Astrocyte culture","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

Al-Jouf region is considered as one of the most vulnerable areas to the disease outbreak. This research aimed to assess (to the best of our knowledge), for the first time, the current level of awareness towards MERS-CoV among the Al-Jouf region population through a well-designed multistage questionnaire. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 384 participants recruited from various places in Al-Jouf government was conducted through a valid and reliable questionnaire including sociodemographic and MERS-CoV knowledge data. RESULTS: The majority of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about MERS-CoV. Age, education, and occupation were the only significant predictors of the level of low awareness concern. Also, the public awareness about the nature, communicability, and lethal effect of the disease was good overall; however, knowledge about incubation period, clinical picture, and epidemiology of the disease needs more governmental concern. The Ministry of Health was the main source of information. CONCLUSION: Empowering public information regarding the incubation period and epidemiology of the disease is needed. Frequent communication between healthcare providers and both school students and non-educated individuals is recommended to help the Saudi government in controlling the disease outbreak.

The cytoplasmic RNA helicases, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), were discovered in 2004 as viral sensors that trigger the antiviral IFN response by recognizing the nonself signatures of viral RNAs. The mechanisms underlying the recognition of viral RNAs and signal transduction leading to the production of type I IFN have been intensively studied following the discovery of RLRs. Moreover, a dysregulation in the expression of RLR or aberrant RLR signaling has been implicated in the development of a number of autoimmune diseases. We herein provide an overview of recent advances in RLR research and discussed future directions.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Hiroki; Fujita, Takashi","journal":"Encyclopedia of Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151769.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797020051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797020051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral sensors","viral infection","recognition of viral RNAs","RLR research","antiviral IFN response","expression of RLR","nonself signatures of viral RNAs","aberrant RLR","discovery of RLRs","signal transduction","overview of recent advances","RIG","future directions","production of type","powerful system","development","number of autoimmune diseases","cytoplasmic RNA helicases","mammals","vertebrates","mechanisms","receptors","dysregulation","interferon"],"language":"en"},

They consist of a nucleic acid genome packaged within a protein shell. Although relatively simple, viruses exhibit significant diversity in terms of size, genome organization, and capsid architecture. All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites as they must obtain energy and building blocks from the cell. They subvert many host cell processes for their own replication, and studying virus replication has provided detailed information about the basic workings of cells. At the cellular level, possible outcomes of infection range from production of virus particles without damage to the cell, to cell death, or occasionally cell transformation. In humans and animals the outcomes of infection range from inapparent (no disease) to considerable disease and death. Some viruses cause acute infections lasting for days or a few weeks while others infect their hosts for a lifetime. Viruses can evolve and rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Some viruses are easily replicated in cultured cells, while others require specific conditions only found in specialized cells within a human or animal. While this text focuses on viruses of humans and other animals, viruses infect organisms of all types, from bacteria to fungi to plants. Viruses are most often classified based on groups of genome and virion characteristics. Genome sequence comparisons provide an unbiased method for grouping and categorizing viruses.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses of humans","Abstract Viruses","cell death","cell transformation","genome organization","groups of genome","host cell processes","virus replication","specialized cells","Genome sequence comparisons","nucleic acid genome","animals","cultured cells","possible outcomes of infection range","basic workings of cells","considerable disease","cellular level","specific conditions","production of virus particles","terms of size","detailed information","significant diversity","inapparent","unbiased method","damage","infectious agents","bacteria","energy","days","types","organisms","protein shell","capsid architecture","acute infections","fungi","weeks","virion characteristics","intracellular parasites","text focuses","hosts","plants","nature","blocks","lifetime"],"language":"en"},

SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eun; Erdos, Geza; Huang, Shaohua; Kenniston, Thomas W.; Balmert, Stephen C.; Carey, Cara Donahue; Raj, V.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00B710, 95% CI 1\u00B703\u20131\u00B717, per year increase; p=0\u00B70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00B765, 2\u00B761\u201312\u00B723; p\u003C0\u00B70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03BCg/mL (18\u00B742, 2\u00B764\u2013128\u00B755; p=0\u00B70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00B70 days (IQR 17\u00B70\u201324\u00B70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03BCg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng","journal":"J Orthop Translat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaacc0ad0bc151a9385e79bf0dbef64cb75c4749.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292697/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214031X20300449; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214031X20300449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osteonecrosis","Harris"],"organizations":["SARS","ONFH","HGF","Association Research Circulation","ARCO Stage III"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","bilateral steroid-associated ONFH","treatment of steroid","associated ONFH secondary","oral HGF therapy","corticosteroid therapy","precollapse hips","total hip arthroplasty","mean Harris hip score","considerable number of convalescent SARS patients","diagnosis of steroid","Conclusion Chinese herbal HGF therapy","pain score","femoral head collapse","physical function score","mean hip survival time","conservative treatment","ARCO Stage","years of follow-up","study","COVID","severity of osteoarthritis","severity of groin pain","long-term results","definite osteoarthritis","medical imaging modalities","magnetic resonance imaging","traditional Chinese medicine","severe acute respiratory syndrome","beneficial effects","plain radiography","Association Research Circulation Osseous","computed tomography","spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula","common disabling complication","points","females","infection diseases","good alternative","coronavirus disease","outbreak","months","average","methods","Summary Purpose","Kaplan","Meier analysis","China","reserve","Osteonecrosis","Participants","interval","date","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carletti, Timoteo; Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4669e31f2a3d8d02cc29993177ba0b7ea3d474e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11085v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak","testing frames","COVID","true peak","importance of testing","countries","analysis","diversity of novel theoretical approaches","official figures","reported figures","fast-growing wealth of data","apparent epidemic peak","novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2","unpredictable non-stationarity","simple universality class","SIR model","occurrence","comprehensiveness","reporting rates","national authorities","sense","established models","time evolution","extensions","accurate information","fundamental limitation","course","start","natural corollary","intimidating picture","effort","world","deaths","dynamics","onset","scientific community","bias","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Following a mean field approach that models individuals like molecules in a well-mixed solution, I derive a modified SIR model in which the average daily contacts between susceptible and infected population are reduced based on the known infection levels, capturing the effects of social distancing policies. This approach yields a time-varying reproduction number that is continuously adjusted based on infection information through a negative-feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in ecology and Hill functions in chemistry and molecular biology. This feedback-adjustment of the transmission rate causes a structural reduction in infection peak, and simulations indicate that such reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. Simulations also show that a distancing policy based on infection data may substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. If the distancing rate is linearly proportional to infections, this model adds a single parameter to the original SIR, making it useful to illustrate the effects of social distancing enforced based on awareness of infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franco, Elisa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13216v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection data","distancing rate","infection information","infection peak","distancing policy","effects of social distancing policies","known infection levels","awareness of infections","simulations","modified SIR model","Hill functions","original SIR","mortality data","structural reduction","Transmission rates","feedback-adjustment","epidemic outbreaks","negative-feedback term","mean field approach","presence of information delays","time-varying reproduction number","molecules","average daily contacts","models individuals","Holling type","ecology","government response","infected population","well-mixed solution","chemistry","single parameter","molecular biology","course","duration","COVID","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more stable after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with the government message urging to stay home.

Our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or disrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million entries) to provide a rank-ordered list of ~19,000 potentially useful compounds for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining quick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batra, Rohit; Chan, Henry; Kamath, Ganesh; Ramprasad, Rampi; Cherukara, Mathew J.; Sankaranarayanan, Subramanian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2c2a76413508be8a53e8b9fba326f6123fbc8c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03766v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening strategy","isolated SARS-CoV","high-throughput computational drug screening","expensive high-fidelity simulations","rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules","surrogate models","high-fidelity ensemble docking simulations","efficient computational strategy","atom docking simulations","therapeutic agents","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","COVID","hundreds of ligands","Candidate ligands","therapeutic cure of diseases","drug datasets","unprecedented human","efficient pathway","molecule treatment","host receptor region","host-virus interactions","large bio-molecule dataset","Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex","S-protein","economic loss","CureFFI","DrugCentral","machine learning","knowledge of small","binding affinity","list","useful compounds","world","globe","rank","validation","entries","Extensive research","systems","work"],"language":"en"},

These periods reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsiotas, Dimitrios; Magafas, Lykourgos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06536v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Greek COVID","infection-curve","anti-COVID","evolution","time-series body","ongoing spreading of COVID","classic time-series approaches","visibility graph algorithm","novel method","periods of different connectivity","pattern intermediates","values","disease","network analysis","power pattern","generated visibility graph","current logarithmic pattern","low probability","insufficient data","complex network","low-degree nodes","disconnected past-data","modularity optimization algorithm","sequence of different typologies","communities","insights of good policy","better forecasting","instability of medium","stability of hubs","order polynomial","management","decision-making practices","variability","scientific research","future","structural decomposition","success story","high uncertainty","fight","paper","maximum","relation","context","Greece","countries","overall approach","policies","performance","war","couple of exponential patterns","average","saturation","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Here we present a comparative study of the performance of states of India, in curbing the spread of the disease, that are most affected by the pandemic. We have done so based on the data collected between 14th March, 2020 to 17th April, 2020. We do this by comparing the smoothened time series and percentage changes along with change point detection of the daily confirmed cases. We also discuss the different policies and strategies adopted by the states in curbing the disease and the ground level implementation. We have developed ARIMA(p,d,q) models where (p,d,q) are obtained by minimising the AIK(Akaike Information Criterion). These models are used to make forecasts for the country which show that by 7th May, 2020, India would have around 50,237 confirmed cases and a doubling rate of 11 days. On the basis of the performance, of each state, we argue that a local level strategy which is based on the demographics of that particular region be developed instead of a central and uniform one.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patwardhan, Chinmay","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5c77d8af44e4de407c5b3216cbce4d071b45330.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13632v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIK(Akaike Information Criterion"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["performance of states","disease","models","India","daily confirmed cases","local level strategy","ground level implementation","percentage changes","change point detection","smoothened time series","doubling rate","demographics","Akaike Information Criterion","strategies","comparative study","ARIMA","particular region","different policies","footsteps","world","days","forecasts","spread","SARS-COV","population","pandemic","country","basis","home","data"],"language":"en"},

Predictions of the further course of the epidemic are decisive to deploy targeted disease control measures. We consider a network-based model to describe the 2019-nCoV epidemic in the Hubei province. The network is composed of the cities in Hubei and their interactions (e.g., traffic flow). However, the precise interactions between cities is unknown and must be inferred from observing the epidemic. We propose a network-based method to predict the future prevalence of the 2019-nCoV virus in every city. Our results indicate that network-based modelling is beneficial for an accurate forecast of the epidemic outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prasse, Bastian; Achterberg, Massimo A.; Ma, Long; Mieghem, Piet Van","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbce857a113a7bbcd7d958329a3abae6215de418.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04482v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV epidemic","network-based modelling","network-based method","nCoV virus","epidemic outbreak","cities","future prevalence","precise interactions","future evolution","Hubei province","accurate forecast","targeted disease control measures","course","results","traffic flow","city","moment of writing","Predictions"],"language":"en"}]}

Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ-1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg2\u002B and Fe3\u002B ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection. Since last several decades\u2019 scientific community has witnessed a rapid increase in number of such human pathogenic bacterial species that acquired resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Currently, emergence of multidrug-resistant strains remain a major public health concern for clinical investigators that rings a global alarm to search for novel and highly conserved drug targets. Recently, G-quadruplex structure forming nucleic acid sequences were endorsed as highly conserved Drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens including viral and protozoan species. Therefore, here we explored the presence G-quadruplex forming motif in genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria that causes food poisoning, and enteric fever in human. The formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure in four genes (mgtA, entA, malE and malK) was confirmed by NMR, CD and EMSA. The 9-amino acridine, a known G-quadruplex binder has been shown to stabilize the predicted G-quadruplex motif and decreases the expressioin of G-quadruplex hourbouring genes using RT-PCR and cellular toxicity assay. This study concludes the presence of G-quadruplex motifs in essential genes of Salmonella enterica genome as a novel and conserved drug target and 9-amino acridine as candidate small molecule for preventing the infection of Salmonella enterica using a G4 mediated inhibition mechanism.","publish_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Neha; Mishra, Subodh Kumar; Shankar, Uma; Tawani, Arpita; Jaiswal, Ankit; Sharma, Tarun Kumar; Kodgire, Prashant; Kumar, Amit","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec8e763a2bfcecdb673d991a184575d0407258c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/83cca3779f8aeea47c5426e1d0fa65f1e9567e0c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/357046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["NMR","PGQ","EMSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence G-quadruplex","presence of G","conserved G-quadruplex motifs","predicted G-quadruplex motif","expressioin of G","G-quadruplexes","known G-quadruplex binder","quadruplex hourbouring genes","presence of SE","biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex","Salmonella enterica infection","infection of Salmonella enterica","formation of intra molecular G-quadruplex structure","strains of Salmonella enterica","formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures","malK genes","malE genes","essential genes of Salmonella enterica genome","Salmonella enterica growth","amino acridine","genome of Salmonella enterica bacteria","SE-PGQs","novel therapeutic drug target","potential drug target","conserved drug targets","expression of PGQ","CD","human pathogenic bacterial species","various human pathogens","presence of reactive nitrogen","gastrointestinal tract of human","devolping novel therapeutics","oxygen species","resistant strains","protozoan species","regulatory region of mgtA","promoter region of malE","products of mgtA","EMSA","RT-PCR","bacterial survival","inhibitory effect","stabilizing effect","open reading frame of entA","polymerase inhibition","Cellular studies","NMR spectroscopy","Bioinformatics analysis","RT-qPCR assays","major carbon source","cellular toxicity assay","transport of maltose sugar","major public health concern","G4 mediated inhibition mechanism","clinical investigators","food poisoning","rapid increase","number","nucleic acid sequences","candidate small molecule","host macrophages","homeostasis of Mg2","global alarm","enteric fever","multiple antibacterial agents","decades\u2019 scientific community","emergence of multidrug","Fe3","and3","study"],"language":"en"},

Careful and proper selection of adjuvants helps in promoting appropriate immune responses against target pathogens at both innate and adaptive levels such that protective immunity can be elicited. Areas covered: Herein, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants that are licensed for use in human vaccines or in clinical or pre-clinical stages at both innate and adaptive levels. Different pathogens have distinct characteristics, which require the host to mount an appropriate immune response against them. Adjuvants can be selected to elicit a tailor-made immune response to specific pathogens based on their unique properties. Identification of biomarkers of adjuvanticity for several candidate vaccines using omics-based technologies can unravel the mechanism of action of modern and experimental adjuvants. Expert opinion: Adjuvant technology has been revolutionized over the last two decades. In-depth understanding of the role of adjuvants in activating the innate immune system, combined with systems vaccinology approaches, have led to the development of next-generation, novel adjuvants that can be used in vaccines against challenging pathogens and in specific target populations.","publish_time":"2019-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Indranil; Garg, Ravendra; van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, Sylvia","journal":"Expert Rev Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3d6f4f84b0b2642247143314bb8f6788ad6a115.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103699.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2019.1604231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental adjuvants","role of adjuvants","novel adjuvants","specific pathogens","target pathogens","proper selection of adjuvants","innate immune system","challenging pathogens","Different pathogens","appropriate immune responses","tailor-made immune response","candidate vaccines","human vaccines","adaptive levels","specific target populations","mechanism of action","mode of action","In-depth understanding","pre-clinical stages","omics-based technologies","adjuvanticity","host","systems vaccinology approaches","distinct characteristics","integral component","use","Expert opinion","Adjuvant technology","subunit vaccine formulations","development","Identification of biomarkers","protective immunity","generation","Introduction","unique properties","recent progress","Areas","decades"],"language":"en"},

It is a response to various diseases of variable etiology, including SARS-CoV infection. To date, a comprehensive study of the genomic physiopathology of ARDS (and SARS) is lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level (instead of blood, sputa or swaps). Hereby we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of SARS and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement. We performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by immunohistochemistry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed. Significant expression levels were identified for ANPEP (a receptor for CoV), as well as inhibition of the STAT1 pathway, IFNs production and CXCL10 (a T-cell recruiter). Other genes unassociated to date with ARDS/SARS include C1Qb, C5R1, CASP3, CASP9, CD14, CD68, FGF7, HLA-DRA, IGF1, IRF3, MALAT-1, MSR1, NFIL3, SLPI, USP33, CLC, GBP1 and TAC1. As a result, we proposed to therapeutically target some of these genes with compounds such as ANPEP inhibitors, SLPI and dexamethasone.

Human coronavirus (hCoV) NL63 is associated with up to 10% of common colds. Viral plaque assays enable the characterization of virus infectivity and allow for purifying virus stock solutions. They are essential for drug screening. Hitherto used cell cultures for hCoV-NL63 show low levels of virus replication and weak and diffuse cytopathogenic effects. It has not yet been possible to establish practicable plaque assays for this important human pathogen. RESULTS: 12 different cell cultures were tested for susceptibility to hCoV-NL63 infection. Human colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2) replicated virus more than 100 fold more efficiently than commonly used African green monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2). CaCo-2 cells showed cytopathogenic effects 4 days post infection. Avicel, agarose and carboxymethyl-cellulose overlays proved suitable for plaque assays. Best results were achieved with Avicel, which produced large and clear plaques from the 4(th )day of infection. The utility of plaque assays with agrose overlay was demonstrated for purifying virus, thereby increasing viral infectivity by 1 log 10 PFU/mL. CONCLUSION: CaCo-2 cells support hCoV-NL63 better than LLC-MK2 cells and enable cytopathogenic plaque assays. Avicel overlay is favourable for plaque quantification, and agarose overlay is preferred for plaque purification. HCoV-NL63 virus stock of increased infectivity will be beneficial in antiviral screening, animal modelling of disease, and other experimental tasks.","publish_time":"2008-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herzog, Petra; Drosten, Christian; M\u00FCller, Marcel A","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25e0a5092935b57609da913715f5e1e5e6ecb91f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2603006.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytopathogenic plaque assays","Viral plaque assays","practicable plaque assays","utility of plaque assays","hCoV-NL63 infection","plaque quantification","plaque purification","HCoV-NL63 virus stock of increased infectivity","characterization of virus infectivity","LLC-MK2 cells","Avicel overlay","CaCo","purifying virus stock solutions","viral infectivity","agarose overlay","Human colon carcinoma cells","low levels of virus replication","agrose overlay","diffuse cytopathogenic effects","Human coronavirus","day of infection","African green monkey kidney cells","important human pathogen","different cell cultures","days post infection","antiviral screening","drug screening","Best results","carboxymethyl-cellulose overlays","susceptibility","animal modelling of disease","broad range of diseases","Coronaviruses","animals","clear plaques","BACKGROUND","humans","log","PFU","experimental tasks","fold","CONCLUSION","common colds"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5\u0027-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV).

Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We compared changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1.

The country of Georgia conducts sentinel surveillance to monitor SARI activity and changes in its infectious etiology. This study characterizes the epidemiology of SARI in Georgia over the 2015/16 and 2016/17 influenza seasons, compares clinical presentations by etiology, and estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative design. METHODS: SARI cases were selected through alternate day systematic sampling between September 2015 and March 2017 at five sentinel surveillance inpatient sites. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex diagnostic system. We present SARI case frequencies by demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and clinical presentation, and used logistic regression to estimate influenza A vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: 1,624 patients with SARI were identified. More cases occurred in February (28.7%; 466/1624) than other months. Influenza was the dominant pathogen in December-February, respiratory syncytial virus in March-May, and rhinovirus in June-November. Serious clinical symptoms including breathing difficulties, ICU hospitalization, and artificial ventilation were common among influenza A and human metapneumovirus cases. For influenza A/H3, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Multi-pathogen diagnostic testing through Georgia\u2019s sentinel surveillance provides useful information on etiology, seasonality, and demographic associations. Influenza A and B were associated with more severe outcomes, although the majority of the population studied was unvaccinated. Findings from sentinel surveillance can assist in prevention planning.","publish_time":"2018-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakhunashvili, Giorgi; Wagner, Abram L.; Power, Laura E.; Janusz, Cara B.; Machablishvili, Ann; Karseladze, Irakli; Tarkhan-Mouravi, Olgha; Zakhashvili, Khatuna; Imnadze, Paata; Gray, Gregory C.; Anderson, Benjamin; Boulton, Matthew L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39809942de9e0dd4d8449754015aa6f9aec3e2c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6066249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059540/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201497","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","ICU"],"locations":["Georgia"],"keyphrases":["SARI cases","influenza seasons","SARI activity","epidemiology of SARI","Georgia\u2019s sentinel surveillance","estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness","sentinel surveillance inpatient sites","present SARI case frequencies","clinical presentations","infectious etiology","respiratory viruses","human metapneumovirus cases","Severe Acute Respiratory Infection","Serious clinical symptoms","unknown vaccination status","respiratory syncytial virus","demographic characteristics","Multi-pathogen diagnostic testing","disease status","demographic associations","dominant pathogen","severe outcomes","country of Georgia","multiplex diagnostic system","ICU hospitalization","breathing difficulties","co-morbidities","useful information","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","artificial ventilation","protective association","logistic regression","seasonality","changes","substantial mortality","test-negative design","alternate day systematic sampling","majority","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","H3","Nasopharyngeal swabs","morbidity","prevention planning","population","RESULTS","patients","study","Findings","METHODS","months","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

The immune evasion mechanism including type 1 interferon and protein kinase R-mediated antiviral stress responses has been recently attributed to the involvement of MERS-CoV protein 4a (p4a) that masks the viral dsRNA. However, the structural mechanism of how p4a recognizes and establishes contacts with dsRNA is not well explained. In this study, we report a dynamic mechanism deployed by p4a to engage the viral dsRNA and make it unavailable to the host immune system. Multiple variants of p4a-dsRNA were created and investigated through extensive molecular dynamics procedures to highlight crucial interfacial residues that may be used as potential pharmacophores for future drug development. The structural analysis revealed that p4a exhibits a typical \u03B1\u03B2\u03B2\u03B2\u03B1 fold structure, as found in other dsRNA-binding proteins. The \u03B11 helix and the \u03B21-\u03B22 loop play a crucial role in recognizing and establishing contacts with the minor grooves of dsRNA. Further, mutational and binding free energy analyses suggested that in addition to K63 and K67, two other residues, K27 and W45, might also be crucial for p4a-dsRNA stability.","publish_time":"2017-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batool, Maria; Shah, Masaud; Patra, Mahesh Chandra; Yesudhas, Dhanusha; Choi, Sangdun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c9f3df22b058cb0b95c53f12cdffd1c5fe1ce93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5596018.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28900197/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11736-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["p4a-dsRNA stability","viral dsRNA","dsRNA-binding proteins","minor grooves of dsRNA","Multiple variants of p4a","structural mechanism","immune evasion mechanism","crucial role","crucial interfacial residues","CoV protein","MERS-CoV","contacts","host\u2019s immune system","host immune system","dynamic mechanism","involvement of MERS","structural analysis","protein kinase R","binding free energy analyses","type","interferon","\u03B21-\u03B22 loop","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","extensive molecular dynamics procedures","addition","recognizing","antiviral stress responses","potential pharmacophores","typical \u03B1\u03B2\u03B2\u03B2\u03B1 fold structure","future drug development","K67","K63","sophisticated network","\u03B11 helix","K27","W45","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. We targeted all nurses and doctors working in three governmental hospitals in the Gaza Strip and worked with victims of the last war, more specifically, those who were working in emergency departments, intensive care units, operating rooms, surgical departments, and burn units. A demographic sheet and Impact Event Scale\u2013Revised were used in this study. The Impact Event Scale\u2013Revised has three sub-scales; intrusion, avoidance, and hyper-arousal. RESULTS: The results showed that 291 (89.8%) of 324 participants had scores more than 35 (threshold cut-off point) on the Impact Event Scale\u2013Revised. Scores ranged from zero to 80 with a mean of 52.13. Females had higher levels of stress (55.79) than males (51.63) and nurses (54.85) had more stress than physicians (47.38). The most frequent symptoms of trauma subscales was \u201Cavoidance\u201D (mean = 20.04), followed by \u201Cintrusion\u201D (mean = 17.83), and then \u201Chyper-arousal\u201D (mean = 14.27). Levels of trauma symptoms were not affected by place of living, hospital of work, while level of education had impacted level of trauma. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that health care providers suffered from severe posttraumatic symptoms after exposure to prolonged war stress. This level of trauma among health care providers warrants intervention programs to reduce stress and trauma among Gaza health care providers after the war.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abu-El-Noor, Nasser Ibrahim; Aljeesh, Yousef Ibrahim; Radwan, AbdalKarim Said; Abu-El-Noor, Mysoon Khalil; Qddura, Ibrahim Abdel-Ilhady; Khadoura, Khalid Jamal; Alnawajha, Samer Khader","journal":"Arch Psychiatr Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8e4e9e25bcfc43b68464b5bdf44653af143e6c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135666.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883941715001661; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883941715001661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992869/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2015.08.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gaza Strip","Gaza"],"keyphrases":["level of trauma","Gaza health care providers","mean","prolonged war stress","Levels of trauma symptoms","level of posttraumatic stress disorder","higher levels of stress","Impact Event Scale","study","frequent symptoms of trauma subscales","intensive care units","severe posttraumatic symptoms","Gaza Strip","level of education","exposure","avoidance","intrusion","hyper-arousal","nurses","scores","RESULTS","surgical departments","emergency departments","operating rooms","Israeli offensives","intervention programs","relationship","threshold cut-off point","hospital of work","governmental hospitals","sub-scales","place of living","demographic sheet","findings","doctors","cross-sectional design","Females","victims","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSION","participants","PURPOSE","physicians"],"language":"en"},

With each pathogen demonstrating a unique response to environmental conditions and the mechanical stresses it experiences, the choice of sampling device is not obvious. Our aim was to review bioaerosol sampling, sampling equipment, and methodology. A comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic databases to retrieve English language papers on bioaerosol sampling. The review describes the mechanisms of popular bioaerosol sampling devices such as impingers, cyclones, impactors, and filters, explaining both their strengths and weaknesses, and the consequences for microbial bioefficiency. Numerous successful studies are described that point to best practice in bioaerosol sampling, from the use of small personal samplers to monitor workers\u0027 pathogen exposure through to large static samplers collecting airborne microbes in various healthcare settings. Of primary importance is the requirement that studies should commence by determining the bioefficiency of the chosen sampler and the pathogen under investigation within laboratory conditions. From such foundations, sampling for bioaerosol material in the complexity of the field holds greater certainty of successful capture of low-concentration airborne pathogens. From the laboratory to use in the field, this review enables the investigator to make informed decisions about the choice of bioaerosol sampler and its application.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haig, C.

Mannose binding lectin gene 2 (MBL2) polymorphisms are reported to be associated with various diseases. In spite of being exhaustively studied molecule, no attempt has been made till date to comprehensively and systematically analyze the SNPs of MBL2 gene. The present study was carried out to identify and prioritize the SNPs of MBL2 gene for further genotyping and functional studies. To predict the possible impact of SNPs on MBL structure and function SNP data obtained from dbSNP database were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. Out of total 661 SNPs, only 37 validated SNPs having minor allele frequency \u22650.10 were considered for the present study. These 37 SNPs includes one in 3\u2032 near gene, nine in 3\u2032 UTR, one non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP), thirteen intronic SNPs and thirteen in 5\u2032 near gene. From these 37 SNPs, 11 non-coding SNPs were identified to be of functional significance and evolutionary conserved. Out of these, 4 SNPs from 3\u2032 UTR were found to play role in miRNA binding, 7 SNPs from 5\u2032 near and intronic region were predicted to involve in transcription factor binding and expression of MBL2 gene. One nsSNP Gly54Asp (rs1800450) was found to be deleterious and damaging by both SIFT and Polyphen-2 servers and thus affecting MBL2 protein stability and expression. Protein structural analysis with this amino acid variant was performed by using I-TASSER, RAMPAGE, Swiss-PdbViewer, Chimera and I-mutant. Information regarding solvent accessibility, molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations showed that this variant causes clashes with neighboring amino acids residues that must interfere in the normal triple helix formation of trimeric subunit and further with the normal assembly of MBL oligomeric form, hence decrease in stability. Thus, findings of the present study indicated 12 SNPs of MBL2 gene to be functionally important. Exploration of these variants may provide novel remedial markers for various diseases.","publish_time":"2016-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalia, Namarta; Sharma, Aarti; Kaur, Manpreet; Kamboj, Sukhdev Singh; Singh, Jatinder","journal":"Springerplus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1af8d169cf2d572b46f2b94b1e83c66686973297.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4916122.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27390651/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2543-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chimera"],"organizations":["MBL","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SNPs of MBL2 gene","intronic SNPs","validated SNPs","expression of MBL2 gene","non-coding SNPs","possible impact of SNPs","Mannose binding lectin gene","MBL2 protein stability","present study","various diseases","miRNA binding","MBL structure","important role","UTR","amino acid variant","Protein structural analysis","liver derived protein","non-synonymous SNP","various bioinformatics tools","normal assembly of MBL oligomeric form","functional significance","functional studies","nsSNP Gly54Asp","intronic region","variant causes clashes","function SNP data","neighboring amino acids residues","normal triple helix formation of trimeric subunit","molecular dynamics","energy minimization calculations","dbSNP database","solvent accessibility","novel remedial markers","genotyping","Swiss-PdbViewer","Chimera","RAMPAGE","variants","Information","minor allele frequency","transcription factor","servers","TASSER","rs1800450","innate immunity","polymorphisms","molecule","attempt","mutant","Exploration","findings","spite","Polyphen"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched stent grafting and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafting in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. RESULTS: During the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched stent grafting. Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n = 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n = 24). Stent grafts included fenestrated (n = 79) and branched (n = 17) Cook stent grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) stent grafts (n = 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) stent grafts (n = 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18.6%). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40.5%) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45.9%) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13.5%) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P \u003C .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary series, IOAEs were relatively frequent during branched or fenestrated stenting procedures and were often responsible for significant complications.","publish_time":"2014-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cochennec, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Kobeiter, Hicham; Gohel, Manj S.; Majewski, Marek; Marzelle, Jean; Desgranges, Pascal; Allaire, Eric; Becquemin, Jean Pierre","journal":"J Vasc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b56223338c555d76f67e7f93f616a6cfadc3468.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127795.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767710/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521414006545; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521414006545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fenestrated","Cook Medical","UK","CAAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Consecutive patients","Stent grafts","branched stent grafting","consecutive elective patients","fenestrated Anaconda","severe complications","Clinical consequences of IOAEs","fenestrated stenting procedures","severe postoperative complications","nonfatal moderate","significant complications","thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms","complex aortic diseases","experience of intraoperative adverse events","CAAAs","intraoperative access","Intraoperative angiograms","TAAAs","clinical outcomes","asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms","composite end point death","study period","retrospective study","Scotland","positioning of graft components","types","treatment","Calif","UK","target vessel cannulation","early experiences","Vascutek Terumo","Ventana","challenging nature","Endologix","Bloomington","Irvine","endovascular devices","hospital mortality rates","pioneering centers","Indications","contemporary series","TAAA groups","tertiary vascular center","impact","METHODS","Spinal cord ischemia","CONCLUSIONS","objectives","RESULTS","vs","computerized database","total"],"language":"en"},

However, rigorous studies correlating procalcitonin levels with microbiologic data are lacking. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have been linked to viral and bacterial infection as well as noninfectious causes. Therefore, we evaluated procalcitonin as a predictor of viral versus bacterial infection in patients hospitalized with AECOPD with and without evidence of pneumonia. METHODS: Adults hospitalized during the winter with symptoms consistent with AECOPD underwent extensive testing for viral, bacterial, and atypical pathogens. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured on day 1 (admission), day 2, and at one month. Clinical and laboratory features of subjects with viral and bacterial diagnoses were compared. RESULTS: In total, 224 subjects with COPD were admitted for 240 respiratory illnesses. Of these, 56 had pneumonia and 184 had AECOPD alone. A microbiologic diagnosis was made in 76 (56%) of 134 illnesses with reliable bacteriology (26 viral infection, 29 bacterial infection, and 21 mixed viral bacterial infection). Mean procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with pneumonia compared with AECOPD. However, discrimination between viral and bacterial infection using a 0.25 ng/mL threshold for bacterial infection in patients with AECOPD was poor. CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin is useful in COPD patients for alerting clinicians to invasive bacterial infections such as pneumonia but it does not distinguish bacterial from viral and noninfectious causes of AECOPD.","publish_time":"2012-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falsey, Ann R; Becker, Kenneth L; Swinburne, Andrew J; Nylen, Eric S; Snider, Richard H; Formica, Maria A; Hennessey, Patricia A; Criddle, Mary M; Peterson, Derick R; Walsh, Edward E","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/228f8d6982646d8233a29c09382e7101afc6c1fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3292390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s29149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22399852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","AECOPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","mixed viral bacterial infection","bacterial diagnoses","biomarker of invasive bacterial infection","invasive bacterial infections","COPD patients","predictor of viral","Serum procalcitonin levels","Mean procalcitonin levels","noninfectious causes of AECOPD","evidence of pneumonia","Acute exacerbations of COPD","day","microbiologic data","microbiologic diagnosis","respiratory illnesses","laboratory features of subjects","alerting clinicians","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","extensive testing","symptoms consistent","winter","antibiotic therapy","rigorous studies","reliable bacteriology","threshold","Adults","total","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","atypical pathogens","discrimination","METHODS","RESULTS","admission","month"],"language":"en"},

Upon binding, MpL is endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner and accumulates initially in the Golgi apparatus and, finally, in the lysosomes. For effective binding and internalization a functional binding site on the \u03B1-repeat is needed. To test the potential of MpL as a carrier for delivering protein drugs to cancer cells we constructed fusion proteins consisting of MpL and the cysteine peptidase inhibitors cystatin C and clitocypin. The fused proteins followed the same endocytic route as the unlinked MpL. Peptidase inhibitor-MpL fusions impaired both the intracellular degradation of extracellular matrix and the invasiveness of cancer cells. MpL is thus shown in vitro to be a lectin that can enable protein drugs to enter cancer cells, enhance their internalization and sort them to lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus.","publish_time":"2017-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u017Durga, Simon; Nanut, Milica Peri\u0161i\u0107; Kos, Janko; Saboti\u010D, Jerica","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bec70be6631ac68e731b98fed55d2c28af45dc3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5432305.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28460472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MpL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unlinked MpL","potential of MpL","Fungal lectin MpL","invasiveness of cancer cells","cancer cell cytotoxicity","Peptidase inhibitor-MpL fusions impaired","trigger cell internalization","cell membranes","protein drugs","effective binding","membrane of tumor cells","Golgi apparatus","lysosomes","functional binding site","Macrolepiota procera lectin","fusion proteins","fused proteins","promising carrier molecules","cysteine peptidase inhibitors cystatin C","intracellular degradation of extracellular matrix","CD13","aminopeptidase N","targeted drug delivery","clitocypin","endocytic route","integrin \u03B13\u03B21","carbohydrate moieties","sort","\u03B1-repeat","glycoproteins","clathrin-dependent manner","Lectins"],"language":"en"},

The recent application to IPF of culture-independent techniques for microbiological analysis has revealed previously unappreciated alterations of the lung microbiome, as well as an increased bacterial burden in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of IPF patients, although correlation does not necessarily entail causation. In addition, the lung microbiome remains only partially characterized and further research should investigate organisms other than bacteria and viruses, including fungi.

The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of influenza virus circulation on mortality in the elderly and adults, in years with different predominant virus strains. METHODS: We performed a time trend study to evaluated excess of mortality for pneumonia and influenza, respiratory disease, and all-causes in southern region of Brazil, from 2002 to 2015. After considering other models, we opted for Serfling regression. Excess of death rates per 100,000 inhabitants were analyzed in specific age groups (24\u201359, 60\u201369, 70\u201379, \u226580 years) and by year of occurrence. Mortality information were taken from Brazilian Mortality Information System and etiological data were accessed in Sentinel Virological Surveillance database, getting the weekly positivity of the immunofluorescence tests for influenza A (H1N1, H3N2), and B. RESULTS: In southern Brazil, there is an evident seasonal pattern of all death outcomes among different age groups in the dry and cold season (April\u2013September). The highest excess mortality rates occurs among older, particularly in years of circulation of influenza AH3N2, especially among people \u226580 years, in 2003 and 2007\u2014years of great severity of influenza activity. After 2009, with the introduction of the pandemic influenza AH1N1, we observed a lower impact on the mortality of the elderly compared to \u003C60 years. DISCUSSION: A cross reactivity antibody response from past exposure probably provided protection against disease in the elderly. Despite not controlling for comorbidities, climate, and vaccination, for the \u003E70 years, ratio of respiratory diseases excess mortality rates between AH1N1 (2009) and severe year of H3N2 (2007) shows protection in the pandemic year and great vulnerability during AH3N2 virus predominance. CONCLUSION: The reduced immune response to infection, and to vaccination, and presence of comorbidities recommend a special attention to this age group in Brazil. Besides medical assistance, the timeliness of vaccine campaigns, its composition, and etiological surveillance of respiratory diseases are some of the preventive and public health measures.","publish_time":"2018-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freitas, Andr\u00E9 Ricardo Ribas; Donalisio, Maria Rita","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3be0bd1914203f4536b93862e93434e84e531335.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5767013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375560/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mortality Information System"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["excess of mortality","influenza infection","influenza AH3N2","years of circulation","highest excess mortality rates","pandemic influenza AH1N1","years of great severity of influenza activity","impact of influenza virus circulation","ratio of respiratory diseases excess mortality rates","Excess of death rates","Brazilian Mortality Information System","different age groups","southern Brazil","pandemic year","elderly population","longer-lived age","specific age groups","etiological surveillance of respiratory diseases","death outcomes","AH3N2 virus predominance","protection","southern region of Brazil","vaccination","severe year of H3N2","year of occurrence","different predominant virus strains","etiological data","all-causes","great vulnerability","lower impact","presence of comorbidities","important causes of hospitalization","reduced immune response","time trend study","cross reactivity antibody response","Sentinel Virological Surveillance database","past exposure","weekly positivity","composition","clinical complications","inhabitants","special attention","evident seasonal pattern","timeliness of vaccine campaigns","immunofluorescence tests","preventive","adults","pneumonia","DISCUSSION","medical assistance","cold season","public health measures","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","introduction","people","models","Serfling regression","METHODS","PURPOSE","climate","objective"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children hospitalized for a febrile respiratory disease were included in this prospective cohort study conducted at Bordeaux University\u0027s Children\u0027s Hospital (France) during the influenza epidemic from 2009/11/23 to 2009/12/20. RESULTS: Seventy-three children were included in the study. Viruses were identified by PCR in 52% (38/73) of cases, including 23% (17/73) A(H1N1) virus and 29% (21/73) other viruses, 22% (16/73) of which were syncytial respiratory viruses. There was only one case of co-infection between A(H1N1) virus and another virus from the para-influenza virus or adenovirus or bocavirus pool. No significant difference regarding age, sex, or risk factors in the different viral groups was noted.

Both ACE and ACE2 have catalytic activity that is chloride sensitive and is caused by the presence of the CL1 and CL2 chloride\u2010binding sites in ACE and the CL1 site in ACE2. The chloride regulation of activity is also substrate dependent. Site\u2010directed mutagenesis was employed to elucidate which of the CL1 and CL2 site residues are responsible for chloride sensitivity. The CL1 site residues Arg186, Trp279 and Arg489 of testicular ACE and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169, Trp271 and Lys481 were found to be critical to chloride sensitivity. Arg522 of testicular ACE was also confirmed to be vital to the chloride regulation mediated by the CL2 site. In addition, Arg514 of ACE2 was identified as a residue critical to substrate selectivity, with the R514Q mutant, relative to the wild\u2010type, possessing a fourfold greater selectivity for the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin\u2010(1\u20137) from the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The enhancement of angiotensin II cleavage by R514Q ACE2 was a result of a 2.5\u2010fold increase in V (max) compared with the wild\u2010type. Inhibition of ACE2 was also found to be chloride sensitive, as for testicular ACE, with residues Arg169 and Arg514 of ACE2 identified as influencing the potency of the ACE2\u2010specific inhibitor MLN\u20104760.

Abstract Particular attention is given to lower respiratory tract infections because of their frequency and potential severity. These infections represent a major cause of death worldwide and pneumonia remains the first cause of death from infectious origin in France. Three nosological entities are usually described according to the anatomic localization of the infectious process: acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchopneumonia (if the infection involves the bronchial tree and the lung parenchyma). If bronchial infection occurs within the context of a chronic respiratory tract disease, it is called acute decompensation of chronic lung disease (usually chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The major diagnostic difficulties are to be able to confirm alveolar implication in the infectious process and to determine the pathogenic agent(s) responsible for the clinical pattern. This information is essential for subsequent care depends. Apart from clinical examination, essential in this context, only chest-X-rays can be of any help to confirm alveolar involvement in the disease process. On the contrary, the interest of systematic microbiological confirmation and its value according to various techniques and swab conditions may be questioned for the clinical diagnosis. Microbiological confirmation does not seem essential in every case. The feasibility and relevance of microbiological techniques must be determined before any decision is taken on documentation. The microbiological documentation value depends on its yield and sensitivity profile in identifying the pathogen.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philippart, F.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e677c1df8fa33ca25e28bf98cdfe842e6c6fb72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131155.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X06002344; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X06002344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["the interest","The feasibility","the contrary","the clinical diagnosis","the clinical pattern","the lung parenchyma","in identifying the pathogen","if the infection involves the bronchial tree","to determine the pathogenic agent","The major diagnostic difficulties","The microbiological documentation value depends","pneumonia remains the first cause","to be able to confirm alveolar implication in the infectious process","any help to confirm alveolar involvement in the disease process","usually described according to the anatomic localization","cas d\u0027infections","If bronchial infection occurs within the context","essential in this context","chronic lung disease","major cause","chronic respiratory tract disease","its value according to various techniques","death from infectious origin in France","This information is essential","diagnostic microbiologique","cas de persistance","cas de la possibilit\u00E9","seem essential in every case","Abstract Particular attention is given to lower respiratory tract infections because","systematic microbiological confirmation","Microbiological confirmation does","principales cause de mortalit\u00E9","infections respiratoires basses","These infections represent","usually chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","microbiological techniques must be determined before any decision is taken","premi\u00E8re cause de d\u00E9c\u00E8s","d\u00E9compensation infectieuse","origine infectieuse","agent pathog\u00E8ne","d\u00E9cision de documentation","pr\u00E9sence","participation alv\u00E9olaire","valeur diagnostique","it is called acute decompensation","X-rays can be","Apart from clinical examination","fonction de la localisation infectieuse","swab conditions may be questioned","death worldwide","its yield","acute bronchitis","arbre bronchique","maladie bronchique","subsequent care depends","principales difficult\u00E9s diagnostiques","only chest","sensitivity","bronchopneumonia","their frequency","relevance","contexte","Three nosological entities","responsible","pneumopathies","monde","potential severity","bronchite aigu\u00EB","radiographie thoracique","bronchopathie chronique","processus infectieux","examen physique","seule","cadre","imp\u00E9ratifs","entit\u00E9s nosologiques distinctes","indication majeure","n\u00E9cessit\u00E9 syst\u00E9matique","prise","bronches","r\u00E9alisation","bronchopneumopathie","dehors","faisabilit\u00E9","aptitude","\u00E9vidence","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","doute","certitude","charge th\u00E9rapeutique","profil de sensibilit\u00E9","parenchyme pulmonaire","\u00E9l\u00E9ments","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","agents"],"language":"fr"},

They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.","publish_time":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selvin, Joseph; Lanong, Sheryl; Syiem, Donkupar; De Mandal, Surajit; Kayang, Highland; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Kiran, G.

Without therapy the COVID-19 pandemic is escalating exponentially: from the first reported death in Wuhan China 10th January 2020, it took 91 days for the global death toll to pass 100,000 - then a further 16 days to reach 200,000. A vaccination program will take 1\u20132 years to roll out, once safety and efficacy is proven.

Cell-based approaches include stem cells and exosomes but these will never meet scale of need whilst also carrying risk of viral transmission if contaminated. Countries have introduced Population control with social distancing and lockdown to isolate individuals: this has reduced infectivity rate - \u201CR\u201D - where R denotes the average number of people an infected person will spread the illness to.

Virus entry of HCoV-229E is mediated by its spike (S) protein, where the S1 domain facilitates attachment to host cells and the S2 domain is involved in subsequent fusion of the virus and host membranes. During the fusion process, two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, in the S2 domain assemble into a six-helix membrane-fusion structure termed the fusion core. Here, the complete fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E has been determined at 1.86 \u00C5 resolution, representing the most complete post-fusion conformation thus far among published human alphacoronavirus (\u03B1-HCoV) fusion-core structures. The overall structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core is similar to those of SARS, MERS and HCoV-NL63, but the packing of its 3HR1 core differs from those of SARS and MERS in that it contains more noncanonical \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018da\u2019 layers. Side-by-side electrostatic surface comparisons reveal that the electrostatic surface potentials are opposite in \u03B1-HCoVs and \u03B2-HCoVs at certain positions and that the HCoV-229E surface also appears to be the most hydrophobic among the various HCoVs. In addition to the highly conserved hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2, some polar and electrostatic interactions are also well preserved across different HCoVs. This study adds to the structural profiling of HCoVs to aid in the structure-based design of pan-coronavirus small molecules or peptides to inhibit viral fusion.","publish_time":"2018-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Lei; Meng, Bing; Xiang, Jiangchao; Wilson, Ian A.; Yang, Bei","journal":"Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb57d1d9d929477c14cabe401b967245c70b4715.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6130466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198895/; https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798318008318","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E fusion core","complete fusion-core structure of HCoV","subsequent fusion","viral fusion","fusion process","fusion-core structures","E surface","HCoV-NL63","helix membrane-fusion structure","\u03B1-HCoVs","Virus entry of HCoV","complete post-fusion conformation","3HR1 core","\u03B2-HCoVs","various HCoVs","different HCoVs","electrostatic interactions","S2 domain","overall structure","electrostatic surface comparisons","electrostatic surface potentials","structural profiling of HCoVs","HR2","Human coronavirus","S1 domain","SARS","MERS","structure-based design of pan","conserved hydrophobic interactions","host membranes","coronavirus small molecules","published human alphacoronavirus","mortality","individuals","peptides","mild upper respiratory infections","heathy adults","cells","heptad repeats","weakened immune systems","certain positions","severe complications","protein","attachment","packing","addition","\u00C5 resolution","spike","study","noncanonical","layers"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Seven thousands two hundreds eighty one participants from nine areas in Gyeonggi-do including Pyeongtaek, the origin of the outbreak in 2015 agreed to participate in the survey and the data from 6,739 participants were included in the final analysis. The data on the perceived infection sensitivity were subjected to cluster analysis. The levels of stress, reliability/practice of preventive behaviors, hand washing practice and policy credibility during the outbreak period were analyzed for each cluster. RESULTS: Cluster analysis of infection sensitivity due to the MERS outbreak resulted in classification of participants into four groups: the non-sensitive group (14.5%), social concern group (17.4%), neutral group (29.1%), and overall sensitive group (39.0%). A logistic regression analysis found that the overall sensitive group with high sensitivity had higher stress levels (17.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.77 to 23.00), higher reliability on preventive behaviors (5.81; 95% CI, 4.84 to 6.98), higher practice of preventive behaviors (4.53; 95% CI, 3.83 to 5.37) and higher practice of hand washing (2.71; 95% CI, 2.13 to 3.43) during the outbreak period, compared to the non-sensitive group. CONCLUSIONS: Infection sensitivity of community residents during the MERS outbreak correlated with gender, age, occupation, and health behaviors. When there is an outbreak in the community, there is need to maintain a certain level of sensitivity while reducing excessive stress, as well as promote the practice of preventive behaviors among local residents. In particular, target groups need to be notified and policies need to be established with a consideration of the socio-demographic characteristics of the community.","publish_time":"2016-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Soon Young; Yang, Hee Jeong; Kim, Gawon; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Choi, Bo Youl","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17d92d371f5552921b86de6fb6cd7e65344ddb2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5309729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2016051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28092927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["higher practice of preventive behaviors","MERS outbreak","levels of preventive behaviors","outbreak period","Cluster analysis of infection sensitivity","Infection sensitivity of community residents","non-sensitive group","overall sensitive group","community residents\u2019 infection sensitivity","perceived infection sensitivity","high sensitivity","health behaviors","neutral group","higher stress levels","higher practice of hand washing","hand washing practice","levels of stress","higher reliability","certain level of sensitivity","social concern group","final analysis","classification of participants","excessive stress","logistic regression analysis","data","local residents","target groups","policy credibility","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","age","relationship","hundreds","areas","socio-demographic characteristics","occupation","Pyeongtaek","gender","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","consideration","thousands","Gyeonggi","Korea","confidence interval","study","METHODS","survey","origin","OBJECTIVES","policies"],"language":"en"},

Two influenza outbreaks were reported in two NHs, caused by influenza A(H3N2) strains belonging to cluster 3C.3 and 3C.2a. Although antivirals were available, prophylaxis was not used. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis seems to suggest no multiple introduction into the two NHs reporting the two influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks. A number of factors could have contributed to transmitting influenza in NHs including, the absence of administration of antiviral treatment for prophylaxis of all residents/staff regardless of immunization status because of the poor vaccine match during each outbreak, the intensive contacts with incompletely protected residents and HCWs, and the low adherence of NHs to notification of ILI outbreaks to the health authorities.

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential of a diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, evolution and drug resistance, and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply Oxford Nanopore Technology to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza reads down to a limit of detection of 102-103 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titre and the proportion of influenza reads (p = 4.7\u00D710-5). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza reads for 27/27 samples with high-to-mid viral titres (Cycle threshold (Ct) values \u003C30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titres (Ct values 30-40). No false positive reads were generated from 10 influenza-negative samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% CI 67-93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI 69-100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza titres, we were able to reconstruct \u003E99% complete sequence for all eight gene segments. We also detected Human Coronavirus and generated a near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome from clinical samples. While further optimisation is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza and other respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewandowski, Kuiama; Xu, Yifei; Pullan, Steven T.; Lumley, Sheila F.; Foster, Dona; Sanderson, Nicholas; Vaughan, Alison; Morgan, Marcus; Bright, Nicole; Kavanagh, James; Vipond, Richard; Carroll, Miles; Marriott, Anthony C.; Gooch, Karen E; Andersson, Monique; Jeffery, Katie; Peto, Timothy EA; Crook, Derrick W.; Walker, A Sarah; Matthews, Philippa C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f783a5e029f80516169b19fe6e0dacc1e171f87.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c6ce214454ba61aecdede0c5c9f721dd8425375e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/676155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Oxford Nanopore Technology","Nanopore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza-negative samples","proportion of influenza reads","high influenza titres","clinical samples","pooled samples","genetic analysis of influenza","metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples","Metagenomic viral sequencing","Nanopore sequencing","bacterial reads","mid viral titres","low viral titres","false positive reads","Ct values","Nanopore platform","respiratory viruses","sensitivity","Oxford Nanopore Technology","near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome","complete sequence","pandemic potential","Human Coronavirus","genome copies","diagnostic test","clinical throat swabs","current diagnostic standard","result","large zoonotic reservoir","Cycle threshold","major global public health threat","length virus","pathogenic variants","transmission","insights","strong relationship","sample composition","evolution","drug resistance","approach","promise","diagnosis","increased host","Coverage","gene segments","methods","limit of detection","specificity","optimisation"],"language":"en"},

In preparation for a potential H7N9 epidemic, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of anti-H7N9 drugs with an appropriate model. METHODS: Well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium (HAE) cells were grown at the air\u2013liquid interface, and the H7N9 cell tropism and cytopathic effect were detected by immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The H7N9 replication kinetics and anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human \u03B12b (rhIFN-\u03B12b) and rhIFN-\u03BB1 were compared with different cell lines. The H7N9 viral load and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were quantified by real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: H7N9 could infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells within the three-dimensional (3D) HAE cell culture, which reduced the number of cilia and damaged the airways. The H7N9 replication kinetics differed between traditional cells and 3D HAE cells. Interferon had antiviral activity against H7N9 and alleviated epithelial cell lesions; the antiviral activity of rhIFN-\u03B12b was slightly better than that of rhIFN-\u03BB1. In normal cells, rhIFN-\u03B12b induced a greater amount of ISG expression (MX1, OAS1, IFITM3, and ISG15) compared with rhIFN-\u03BB1, but in 3D HAE cells, this trend was reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Both rhIFN-\u03B12b and rhIFN-\u03BB1 had antiviral activity against H7N9, and this protection was related to the induction of ISGs. The 3D cell culture model is suitable for evaluating interferon antiviral activity because it can demonstrate realistic in vivo-like effects.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ai-jun; Dong, Jie; Yuan, Xin-hui; Bo, Hong; Li, Shu-zhen; Wang, Chao; Duan, Zhao-jun; Zheng, Li-shu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9f6aba70979afa9fe1c10df0bce3909b26bb678.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6448296.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1146-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAE","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N9 influenza","rhIFN-\u03B12b","H7N9 cell tropism","rhIFN-\u03BB1","H7N9 replication kinetics","antiviral activity of rhIFN","H7N9 viral load","potential H7N9 epidemic","D HAE cells","anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human \u03B12b","efficacy of anti-H7N9 drugs","interferon antiviral activity","HAE cell culture","traditional cells","normal cells","D cell culture model","non-ciliated cells","different cell lines","alleviated epithelial cell lesions","ISG expression","human health","interferon-stimulated gene","cytopathic effect","appropriate model","Well-differentiated pseudostratified human airway epithelium","METHODS","OAS1","MX1","liquid interface","IFITM3","immunostaining","ISG15","virus","hematoxylin-eosin","huge threat","real-time PCR assays","number of cilia","preparation","BACKGROUND","protection","trend","airways","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","induction of ISGs","waves of outbreaks","effects"],"language":"en"},

This article reviews how Taiwan strengthened the core capacities at the Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) and the Port of Kaohsiung (PoK) by applying a new, practicable model. DESIGN: An IHR PoE program was initiated for implementing the IHR core capacities at designated PoEs. The main methods of this program were 1) identifying the designated PoEs according to the pre-determined criteria, 2) identifying the competent authority for each health measure, 3) building a close collaborative relationship between stakeholders from the central and PoE level, 4) designing three stages of systematic assessment using the assessment tool published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 5) undertaking action plans targeting the gaps identified by the assessments. RESULTS: Results of the self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment revealed a continuous progressive trend at the TIA (86, 91, and 100%, respectively), and at the PoK (77, 97, and 99.9%, respectively). The results of the follow-up external assessment indicated that both these designated PoEs already conformed to the IHR requirements. These achievements were highly associated with strong collaboration, continuous empowerment, efficient resource integration, and sustained commitments. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that many countries had requested for an extension on the deadline to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements, Taiwan\u0027s experiences can be a source of learning for countries striving to fully implement these requirements. Further, in order to broaden the scope of public health protection into promoting global security, Taiwan will keep its commitments on multisectoral cooperation, human resource capacity building, and maintaining routine and emergency capacities.","publish_time":"2014-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiu, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsieh, Jui-Wei; Wu, Yi-Chun; Chou, Jih-Haw; Chang, Feng-Yee","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dba0cdf3fbecdba11207ba0d7da322fc2a83b798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4104008.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.24516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25037903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health","IHR","World Health Organization","TIA"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["IHR core capacities","designated PoEs","IHR requirements","follow-up external assessment","assessment tool","self-assessment","preliminary external assessment","International Health Regulations","health measure","core capacity requirements","IHR PoE program","RESULTS","stages of systematic assessment","emergency capacities","transmission of international public health risks","World Health Organization","scope of public health protection","designated points of entry","TIA","countries","PoK","human resource capacity building","Taoyuan International Airport","continuous empowerment","sustained commitments","PoE level","efficient resource integration","continuous progressive trend","multisectoral cooperation","stakeholders","Taiwan\u0027s experiences","huge efforts","strong collaboration","global security","close collaborative relationship","critical role","pre-determined criteria","source of learning","Port of Kaohsiung","competent authority","gaps","BACKGROUND","deadline","action plans","practicable model","achievements","extension","main methods","order","article","assessments","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate the Prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Study design The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses in 645 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from children with ARTI from November 2006 to October 2008. All PCR positive products were sequenced. And the demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients. Results Nineteen of 645 (2.95%) specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, and all HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens were distributed in the winter and spring season. The HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 47.37% (9/19). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between groups by age or gender, except between patients with and without underlying diseases. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating in the years 2007 and 2008 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Conclusions HCoV-HKU1 is an uncommon virus existing among Chinese children with ARTI. Children with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to viral infection. Only HCoV-HKU1 genotype B circulated locally.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Yu; Song, Jing-Rong; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Gao, Han-Chun; Yuan, Xin-Hui; Xu, Zi-Qian; Yan, Kun-Long; Zhao, Yang; Xiao, Ni-Guang; Hou, Yun-De; Duan, Zhao-Jun","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/451d4f4aa41f61a5610673688b209da1b168b439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108232.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210002696; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702134/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210002696","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Conclusions HCoV-HKU1","HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens","HCoV-HKU1 genotype B","role of emerging HCoV-HKU1","HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate","ARTI","clinical characteristics of HCoV","Chinese children","Abstract Background Human CoV-HKU1","PCR positive products","common respiratory viruses","acute respiratory tract infection","viral infection","RT-PCR","Lanzhou","underlying diseases","patients","China","detection rate","clinical data","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","nasopharyngeal aspirate","uncommon virus","groups","age","NPA","Study","gender","impact","winter","Prevalence","significant difference","phylogenetic analysis","pneumonia","years","year-old man","spring season","demographic","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

Apart from its well-known antimalarial effects, the drug has interesting biochemical properties that might be applied against some viral infections. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Its best-studied effects are those against HIV replication, which are being tested in clinical trials. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor \u03B1 and interleukin 6, which mediate the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.

Twenty-four field isolates of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) from multiple states in the United States were recovered from 1994 to 2010 to determine the genetic relationships among them. The entire spike (S) gene of each TCoV isolate was amplified and sequenced. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Clustal W program, revealing 90.0 % to 98.4 % sequence identity in the full-length S protein, 77.6 % to 96.6 % in the amino terminus of the S1 subunit (containing one hypervariable region in S1a), and 92.1 % to 99.3 % in the S2 subunit at the deduced amino acid sequence level. The conserved motifs, including two cleavage recognition sequences of the S protein, two heptad repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the Golgi retention signal were identified in all TCoV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length S gene was used to distinguish North American TCoV isolates from French TCoV isolates. Among the North American TCoV isolates, three distinct genetic groups with 100 % bootstrap support were observed. North Carolina isolates formed group I, Texas isolates formed group II, and Minnesota isolates formed Group III. The S genes of 24 TCoV isolates from the United States remained conserved because they contained predominantly synonymous substitutions. The findings of the present study suggest endemic circulation of distinct TCoV genotypes in different geographic locations.

However, more recent studies have demonstrated paracrine effects of administered cells, including stimulation of angiogenesis and modulation of local inflammatory and immune responses in mouse lung disease models. Based on these studies and on safety and initial efficacy data from trials of adult stem cells in other diseases, groundbreaking clinical trials of cell-based therapy have been initiated for pulmonary hypertension and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In parallel, the identity and role of endogenous lung progenitor cells in development and in repair from injury and potential contribution as lung cancer stem cells continue to be elucidated.

Here we describe the cloning and expression of IFN\u03B3 from the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto and the generation of mouse monoclonal and chicken egg yolk antibodies specific to bat IFN\u03B3. Our results demonstrate that P. alecto IFN\u03B3 is conserved with IFN\u03B3 from other species and is induced in bat splenocytes following stimulation with T cell mitogens. P. alecto IFN\u03B3 has antiviral activity on Semliki forest virus in cell lines from P. alecto and the microbat, Tadarida brasiliensis.

FCV is a highly infectious pathogen of cats and typically causes moderate, self-limiting acute oral and upper respiratory tract diseases or chronic oral diseases. In addition, in recent years, virulent, systemic FCV (vs-FCV) strains causing severe systemic diseases with a high mortality rate of up to 67% have been reported in cats. Although FCV vaccines are commercially available, their efficacy is limited due to antigenic diversity of FCV strains and short duration of immunity. In this study, we identified fexaramine as a potent inhibitor of FCV including vs-FCV strains in cell culture and demonstrated that fexaramine is a entry blocker for FCV by using various experiments including time-of-addition studies, generation of resistant viruses in cell culture and the reverse genetics system. A fexaramine resistant FCV mutant has a single amino acid change in the P2 domain of VP1 (the major capsid), and the importance of this mutation for conferring resistance was confirmed using the reverse genetics system. A comparative analysis of viral resistance was also performed using a peptidyl inhibitor (NPI52) targeting FCV 3C-like protease. Finally, the effects of combination treatment of fexaramine and NPI52 against FCV replication and emergence of resistant viruses were investigated in cell culture.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e2c1be088e0e4406e9446e7efc610a6a53d2315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454892/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217306484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217306484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systemic FCV","FCV replication","FCV vaccines","vs-FCV strains","fexaramine resistant FCV mutant","potent inhibitor of FCV","antigenic diversity of FCV strains","cell culture","severe systemic diseases","chronic oral diseases","generation of resistant viruses","emergence of resistant viruses","NPI52","reverse genetics system","effects of combination treatment of fexaramine","upper respiratory tract diseases","addition studies","conferring resistance","peptidyl inhibitor","infectious pathogen of cats","single amino acid change","comparative analysis of viral resistance","P2 domain of VP1","importance","small non-enveloped virus","various experiments","time","short duration of immunity","recent years","high mortality rate","major capsid","entry blocker","efficacy","positive-sense RNA genome","Abstract Feline calicivirus","mutation","protease","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In a large multicentre study, two sputum samples were collected from participants with TB symptoms in reference laboratories in Peru, South Africa, Brazil, and Vietnam. Each sample was tested with TB-LAMP. The reference standard consisted of four direct smears, four cultures, and clinical and radiological findings. Individuals negative on conventional tests were followed up after 8 weeks. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was performed on fresh or frozen samples as a molecular test comparison. RESULTS: A total of 1036 adults with suspected TB were enrolled. Among 375 culture-confirmed TB cases with 750 sputum samples, TB-LAMP detected 75.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.8\u201379.4%), including 97.9% (95% CI 96.4\u201399.4%) of smear-positive TB samples and 46.6% (95% CI 40.6\u201352.7%) of smear-negative TB samples.

However, the direct identification of viral genomes from clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing (NGS) still has its challenges. As a selected viral nucleic acid extraction method may determine the sensitivity and reliability of NGS, it is still valuable to evaluate the extraction efficiency of different extraction kits using clinical specimens directly. RESULTS: In this study, we performed qRT-PCR and viral metagenomic analysis of the extraction efficiency of four commonly used Qiagen extraction kits: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (VRMK), QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (MVSK), RNeasy Mini Kit (RMK), and RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (RPMK), using a mixed respiratory clinical sample without any pre-treatment. This sample contained an adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus A (Flu A), human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), human coronavirus OC43 (OC43), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The quantity and quality of the viral extracts were significantly different among these kits. The highest threshold cycle(Ct)values for ADV and OC43 were obtained by using the RPMK. The MVSK had the lowest Ct values for ADV and PIV3. The RMK revealed the lowest detectability for HMPV and PIV3. The most effective rate of NGS data at 67.47% was observed with the RPMK. The other three kits ranged between 12.1\u201326.79% effectiveness rates for the NGS data. Most importantly, compared to the other three kits the highest proportion of non-host reads was obtained by the RPMK. The MVSK performed best with the lowest Ct value of 20.5 in the extraction of ADV, while the RMK revealed the best extraction efficiency by NGS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of viral nucleic acid extraction efficiency is different between NGS and qRT-PCR analysis. The RPMK was most applicable for the metagenomic analysis of viral RNA and enabled more sensitive identification of the RNA virus genome in respiratory clinical samples. In addition, viral RNA extraction kits were also applicable for metagenomic analysis of the DNA virus. Our results highlighted the importance of nucleic acid extraction kit selection, which has a major impact on the yield and number of viral reads by NGS analysis. Therefore, the choice of extraction method for a given viral pathogen needs to be carefully considered.

The objective of our study is to understand the current status of hospitals preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks in Beijing and to provide basic information for infectious disease prevention and control in hospitals. Methods One hundred fifty-two secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Beijing were surveyed by a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic information and their emergency plans, laboratory diagnosis capacity, medical treatment procedures for infectious diseases, stockpiles of drugs and personal protective equipment, and staff training were collected. Results Responses were received from 134 (88.2%) of the 152 hospitals surveyed. Overall, hospitals reported that the number of physicians and nurses in infectious disease accounted for only 1.8% of the total physicians and 2.5% of the total nurses, and surgery beds accounted for 8.5% of all the fixed beds. Approximately 93.3% of the hospitals surveyed reported that they had an emergency plan, and none of those reported that their laboratories were able to isolate and identify all 8 kinds of common pathogens of infectious diseases: 22.4% of the hospitals had medical treatment procedures for all these infectious diseases, 23.1% had stored specific drugs for treatment, 2.2% had all personal protective equipment, and 30.6% reported that their health care staff had been trained in hospital emergency preparedness for infectious diseases. In general, emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in tertiary care hospitals was better than that in secondary care hospitals; the preparedness at general hospitals was better than that at specialized hospitals; and that at teaching hospitals was better than that at nonteaching hospitals. Conclusion Emergency preparedness for infectious disease at hospitals in Beijing was in an early stage of development during this survey. Comprehensive measures should be developed and implemented to enhance their capacity for infectious disease emergency.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, Zhang; Jian-Shi, Huang; Xiong, He; Peng, Lv; Da-Long, Qiu","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac079fdce85bd5d2d46ca7dec5c4e8a94f6abc3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132672.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655306005244; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655306005244","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["general hospitals","specialized hospitals","nonteaching hospitals","infectious disease emergency","tertiary care hospitals","secondary care hospitals","infectious disease prevention","infectious disease outbreaks","current status of hospitals preparedness","large-scale infectious disease outbreak","hospital emergency preparedness","Conclusion Emergency preparedness","kinds of common pathogens of infectious diseases","emergency plans","Beijing","medical treatment procedures","health care staff","personal protective equipment","total nurses","total physicians","hospital demographic information","basic information","stockpiles of drugs","staff training","specific drugs","number of physicians","surgery beds","fixed beds","laboratory diagnosis capacity","control","early stage of development","survey","study","Data","critical role","Background","standardized questionnaire","Methods","Results Responses","laboratories","Comprehensive measures","objective"],"language":"en"},

Consensus sequences that matched short sequences within the S glycoprotein were identified. The sequence of a tight-binding, mAb-selected peptide suggested the location of a discontinuous epitope within the N-terminal S1 subunit. Several tightly binding phage were amplified and used directly as immunogens in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Partial protection of C57BL/6 mice against a lethal acute virus infection was achieved with a phage preparation that displayed a linear epitope. Protection correlated with the presence of sufficient levels of specific antiviral antibodies recognizing the same immunodominant domain and 13-mer peptide, located within the C-terminal S2 subunit, as the selecting mAb. Thus, the direct use of phage-displayed peptides to evaluate protective antiviral immune responses complements their use to characterize antibody-binding epitopes.

MERS is often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects. We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals. Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and host targets for treatment.

Type I IFNs can influence dendritic cell (DC) activation, maturation, migration, and survival, but also directly enhance natural killer (NK) and T/B cell activity, thus orchestrating various innate and adaptive immune effector functions. Therefore, type I IFNs have long been considered essential in the host defense against virus infections. More recently, it has become clear that depending on the type of virus and the course of infection, production of type I IFN can also lead to immunopathology or immunosuppression. Similarly, in bacterial infections type I IFN production is often associated with detrimental effects for the host. Although most cells in the body are thought to be able to produce type I IFN, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have been termed the natural \u201CIFN producing cells\u201D due to their unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and ability to produce high amounts of type I IFN. Findings from mouse reporter strains and depletion experiments in in vivo infection models have brought new insights and established that the role of pDCs in type I IFN production in vivo is less important than assumed. Production of type I IFN, especially the early synthesized IFN\u03B2, is rather realized by a variety of cell types and cannot be mainly attributed to pDCs. Indeed, the cell populations responsible for type I IFN production vary with the type of pathogen, its tissue tropism, and the route of infection. In this review, we summarize recent findings from in vivo models on the cellular source of type I IFN in different infectious settings, ranging from virus, bacteria, and fungi to eukaryotic parasites.

While producing a global cellular effect, proteasome inhibitors have not triggered the catastrophe articulated initially in terms such as \u201Cbuildup of cellular garbage\u201D. Proteasome inhibitors, in fact, do have a therapeutic window, although in the case of the prototype bortezomib it is small owing to peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression and, as recently reported, cardiotoxicity [1]. Currently, several second-generation molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation to increase this window. An alternative strategy is to target ubiquitin pathway enzymes acting at non-proteasomal sites\u2014E1, E2, and E3, associated with ubiquitin conjugation, and deubiquitylating enzymes (\u201CDUBs\u201D)\u2014that act locally on selected targets rather than on the whole cell. Inhibitors (or activators, in some cases) of these enzymes should be developable as selective antitumor agents with toxicity profiles superior to that of bortezomib. Various therapeutic hypotheses follow from known cellular mechanisms of these target enzymes; most hypotheses relate to cancer, reminiscent of the FDA-approved protein kinase inhibitors now marketed. Since ubiquitin tagging controls the cellular content, activity, or compartmentation of proteins associated with disease, inhibitors or activators of ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation are predicted to have an impact on disease. For practical and empirical reasons, inhibitors of ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been the favored therapeutic avenue. In approximately the time that has elapsed since the approval of bortezomib in 2003, there has been some progress in developing potential anticancer drugs that target various ubiquitin pathway enzymes. An E1 inhibitor and inhibitors of E3 are now in clinical trial, with some objective responses reported. Appropriate assays and/or rational design may uncover improved inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as E2 and DUBs, for further development. Presently, it should become clear whether one or both of the two general strategies for ubiquitin-based drug discovery will lead to truly superior new medicines for cancer and other diseases.

The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM10, PM2.5, BC, benzene, CO, and NOx). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in the TL, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collivignarelli, Maria Cristina; Abb\u00E0, Alessandro; Bertanza, Giorgio; Pedrazzani, Roberta; Ricciardi, Paola; Miino, Marco Carnevale","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/664c8950676efa5900962caf5388484beb94c918.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205654.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720327972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139280; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720327972?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health System"],"locations":["Metropolitan City","Milan"],"keyphrases":["significant increase","significant way","significant decrease","Metropolitan City of Milan","significant reduction of pollutants concentration","air pollutants","subsequent TL","impact","total lockdown","CoViD","adjacent areas","air quality","restriction measures","formation of O3","unprecedented way","rigorous containment measures","higher average concentrations of benzene","pandemic","PM2","vehicular traffic","effect of anthropogenic activities","Italian National Health System","severe limitation of people movements","PM10","time","opportunity","SO2","NO2","appreciable drop","results","rapid spread","application","BC","SaA","Northern Italy","Government","Abstract","paper","NOx"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to evaluate knowledge of IFT among emergency nurses of three Accident and Emergency Departments in Hong Kong. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to registered nurses of the three departments. Data was sought on participants\u2019 characteristics, knowledge on equipment preparation and management of en route adverse events. Four clinical IFT scenarios were set for participants and answers were scored. Measured outcomes were defined as (1) relationships between clinical experience and relevant training in IFT with questionnaire results, (2) staff knowledge of the equipment carried routinely in ambulances and (3) the en route adverse events encountered according to the participants\u2019 past experience. RESULTS: Participants\u2019 test scores ranged from 24 to 37 (out of 40) with a mean of 30.6 (95% confidence interval 29.7\u201331.5). Participants with more clinical experience demonstrated significantly better test scores (p \u003C 0.05). Most participants were familiar with the monitoring devices carried in ambulances but were less familiar with the pharmacologic agents and airway devices available routinely in Hong Kong ambulances. Thirty participants (59%) had encountered en route adverse events in the past. CONCLUSION: Nurses in emergency departments in Hong Kong have good knowledge of IFT. Extensive clinical experience is related to better IFT knowledge. IFT training for nurses should emphasize available ambulance service resources and capabilities.","publish_time":"2008-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeung, K.L.; Yeung, Gladys W.Y.; Chan, Miranda W.S.; Lee, Sara B.C.; Choi, Kenny T.Y.; Lee, Larry L.Y.; Tang, Simon Y.H.; Graham, Colin A.; Chan, Jimmy T.S.","journal":"Int Emerg Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f5610d28b15df43cc92238848aa16af47b19bc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18627800/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2008.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755599X08000566; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755599X08000566","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFT","Emergency Departments"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["better IFT knowledge","IFT training","good knowledge of IFT","emergency nurses","clinical IFT scenarios","adverse events","emergency equipment","Emergency Departments","Hong Kong ambulances","Extensive clinical experience","staff knowledge","participants\u2019 past experience","equipment preparation","registered nurses","Participants\u2019 test scores","better test scores","participants\u2019 characteristics","airway devices available","pre-transport preparation","relevant training","monitoring devices","questionnaire results","Inter-facility transport","available ambulance service resources","Accident","recognition of possible","quality","pharmacologic agents","management","capabilities","INTRODUCTION","relationships","dynamic process","Questionnaires","CONCLUSION","METHODS","Data","answers","study","confidence interval","Measured outcomes","mean"],"language":"en"},

As known, new, and resurgent communicable diseases increase their global impact, the International Health Regulations and the Global Health Security Agenda call for sufficient field epidemiologic capacity in every country to rapidly detect, respond to, and contain public health emergencies, thereby ensuring global health security. To build this capacity, for \u003E35 years the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has worked with countries around the globe to develop Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs). FETP trainees conduct surveillance activities and outbreak investigations in service to ministry of health programs to prevent and control infectious diseases of global health importance such as polio, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. FETP graduates often rise to positions of leadership to direct such programs. By training competent epidemiologists to manage public health events locally and support public health systems nationally, health security is enhanced globally.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Donna S.; Dicker, Richard C.; Fontaine, Robert E.; Boore, Amy L.; Omolo, Jared O.; Ashgar, Rana J.; Baggett, Henry C.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6198c45ade2c9f644ed7556b30e5736439b7e1b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5711325.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2313.170509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health Security Agenda","US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","FETP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health events","public health systems","public health emergencies","ministry of health programs","Global Health Security Agenda","International Health Regulations","control infectious diseases of global health importance","global impact","competent field epidemiologists","Field Epidemiology Training Programs","training competent epidemiologists","emerging zoonotic infectious diseases","sufficient field epidemiologic capacity","resurgent communicable diseases","Disease Control","FETP trainees","FETP graduates","outbreak investigations","malaria","service","AIDS","surveillance activities","cholera","polio","tuberculosis","HIV","Prevention","US Centers","years","globe","countries","country","FETPs","positions of leadership"],"language":"en"},

Methods This was a descriptive quality improvement study conducted in the Texas Children\u0027s Hospital (Houston, TX) pediatric emergency department (ED), covered, open-air parking lot from May 1, 2009, to May 7, 2009. Children aged 18 years or younger were screened for viral respiratory symptoms and sent to designated areas of the ED according to level of acuity, possibility of influenza-like illness, and the anticipated need for laboratory evaluation. Results The mobile pediatric emergency response team experienced 18% of the total ED volume, or a median of 48 patients daily, peaking at 83 patients treated on May 3, 2009. Although few children had positive rapid influenza assay results and the morbidity of disease in the community appeared to be minimal for the majority of children, anxiety about pandemic influenza drove a large number of ED visits, necessitating an increase in surge capacity. Surge capacity was augmented both through utilization of existing institutional resources and by creating a novel area in which to treat patients with potential airborne pathogens. Infection control procedures and patient safety were also maximized through patient cohorting and adaptation of social distancing measures to the ED setting. Conclusion The mobile pediatric emergency response team and screening and triage algorithms were able to safely and effectively identify a group of low-acuity patients who could be rapidly evaluated and discharged, alleviating ED volume and potentially preventing transmission of H1N1 influenza.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Andrea T.; Patel, Binita; DiStefano, Michael C.; Codispoti, Catherine R.; Shook, Joan E.; Demmler-Harrison, Gail J.; Sirbaugh, Paul E.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af673ffbe339cf95c476fcb632efd9acc0ee3de3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124240.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064409014000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837479/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064409014000","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","possibility of influenza","ED setting","mobile pediatric emergency response team","pediatric emergency department","transmission of H1N1 influenza","total ED volume","alleviating ED volume","acuity patients","ill children","majority of children","H1N1 swine influenza outbreak","large number of ED visits","positive rapid influenza assay results","surge capacity","patient cohorting","patient safety","level of acuity","Study objective","descriptive quality improvement study","TX","screening","Houston","illnesses","Texas Children\u0027s Hospital","adaptation of social distancing measures","implementation","triage algorithms","viral respiratory symptoms","morbidity of disease","designated areas","anxiety","Conclusion","utilization of existing institutional resources","anticipated need","Infection control procedures","increase","median","novel area","laboratory evaluation","community","Methods","potential airborne pathogens","years","group of low","open-air parking lot"],"language":"en"},

Our innate immune system and, in particular, the interferon response form the important first line of defence against these viruses. Given their genetic flexibility, these viruses have therefore developed multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response in order to optimize their replication capacity. Already many molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion by \u002BssRNA viruses have been identified. However, research addressing the effect of host innate immune evasion on the pathology caused by viral infections is less prevalent in the literature, though very relevant and interesting. Since interferons have been implicated in inflammatory diseases and immunopathology in addition to their protective role in infection, antagonizing the immune response may have an ambiguous effect on the clinical outcome of the viral disease. Therefore, this review discusses what is currently known about the role of interferons and host immune evasion in the pathogenesis of emerging coronaviruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelemans, Tessa; Kikkert, Marjolein","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb2653d6bccc8ea8da3bb3abef1840d3ba2b9701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6832425.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune response","host immune evasion","innate immune system","molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion","ssRNA viruses","effect of host","interferon response","role of interferons","ambiguous effect","protective role","viral infections","viral disease","pathogenesis of emerging coronaviruses","addition","immunopathology","Positive-sense single-stranded RNA","clinical outcome","order","human pathogens","multiple strategies","literature","inflammatory diseases","alphaviruses","line of defence","public health problem","flaviviruses","replication capacity","genetic flexibility","research","review"],"language":"en"},

However, nurses\u0027 understanding and compliance with these precautions is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess nurses\u0027 knowledge and practices in relation to isolation precautions in Jordan. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. The study took place in 8 hospitals in Jordan. A self-reported questionnaire and an observational checklist were developed based on the CDC (2007) isolation precautions guidelines. Results A total of 247 questionnaires were returned out of 400, for a response rate of 61.7%. The results show that most nurses (90%) have good knowledge of isolation precautions. However, only 65% of nurses reported good compliance with isolation precautions. The results of a t test revealed that nurses with Bachelor\u0027s degrees perform better in knowledge examinations than nurses with 2-year diplomas (P \u003C .001). However, there was no significant difference in knowledge and self-report practices scores based on nurses\u0027 previous training and existence of isolation guidelines in their units or wards (P \u003E .05). The results of the checklists confirm that there is a low compliance with standard isolation practice. In addition, the checklist shows that a high percentage of units and wards do not use isolation signs (46.4%) and posters (34.5%). Conclusions This study revealed that educating nurses about isolation is not enough strategy to improve their compliance. It is important to adapt other strategies, such as supporting nurses by giving them a manageable workload, and providing more supplies and reminders of isolation precautions in the hospitals.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suliman, Mohammad; Aloush, Sami; Aljezawi, Maen; AlBashtawy, Mohammed","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2a85eaad193272ba43b5dc178a1f7b6e8c26069.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132704.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655317310982; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2017.09.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29103636/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317310982","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation precautions guidelines","reminders of isolation precautions","good knowledge of isolation precautions","isolation signs","Background Implementation of isolation precautions","existence of isolation guidelines","standard isolation practice","results","nurses\u0027 knowledge","good compliance","study","knowledge examinations","low compliance","wards","CDC","hospitals","Jordan","nurses\u0027 previous training","self-reported questionnaire","self-report practices scores","observational checklist","high percentage of units","Centers","relation","Bachelor\u0027s degrees","Disease Control","supplies","significant difference","t test","Prevention","year diplomas","Methods","descriptive design","research","manageable workload","place","strategy","clinical evidence","checklists","strategies","Conclusions","total","questionnaires","response rate","posters","addition","aim"],"language":"en"},

Prior infection and passive transfer of neutralizing antibody prevent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the respiratory tract of mice. J. Virol. 78, 3572\u20133577). Ribavirin given at 75mg/kg 4h prior to virus exposure and then given twice daily for 3 days beginning at day 0 was found to increase virus lung titers and extend the length of time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice. Other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors administered near maximum tolerated doses using the same dosing regimen as for ribavirin were found to slightly enhance virus replication in the lungs. In addition, ribavirin treatment seemed also to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 days after cessation of treatment, although after 3 days of treatment ribavirin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected mice, significantly reducing the levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03B1, interleukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These findings suggest that ribavirin may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs. By not inhibiting viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, ribavirin treatment may have provided a continual source of stimulation for the inflammatory response thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection.

The venoms of many different species are rich sources of biologically active components and various therapeutic agents have been characterized including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

This review focuses on AMPs from the venoms of scorpions and examines all classes of AMPs found to date. It gives details of their biological activities with reference to peptide structure. The review examines the mechanism of action of AMPs and with this information, suggests possible mechanisms of action of less well characterised peptides. Finally, the review examines current and future trends of scorpion AMP research, by discussing recent successes obtained through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches.","publish_time":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Patrick L.; Abdel-Rahman, Mohamed A.; Miller, Keith; Strong, Peter N.","journal":"Toxicon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d3b0051618713c434cab71cdd2b85964cbaea48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111748.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041010114001688; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.06.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010114001688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classes of AMPs","review","mechanism of action","antimicrobial peptides","unique mode of action","possible mechanisms of action","new antimicrobial agents","venoms of scorpions","characterised peptides","various therapeutic agents","low resistance rates","active components","future trends of scorpion AMP research","recent successes","rich sources","biological activities","reference","information","potent activity","different species","peptide structure","transcriptomic approaches","urgent requirements","modern medicine","details","need","date","attention"],"language":"en"},

To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated with each subunit, we defined composite motifs that represent context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites. By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that meta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than sequence clusters.

We have investigated the role of these heptad-repeat regions and, specifically, the importance of the putative interhelical a and d position sidechains by using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. All the mutant glycoproteins were expressed and transported to the cell surface. Proteolytic maturation at the subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1-protease (SKI-1/S1P) cleavage site was observed in all but two of the mutants. Among the adequately cleaved mutant glycoproteins, four positions in the N-terminal region (I333, L336, L347 and L350) and two positions in the C-terminal region (R392 and W395) were shown to be important determinants of cell\u2013cell fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that \u03B1-helical coiled-coil structures are likely critical in promoting arenavirus membrane fusion. These findings support the inclusion of the arenavirus GP-C among the Class I viral fusion proteins and suggest pharmacologic and immunologic strategies for targeting arenavirus infection and hemorrhagic fever.","publish_time":"2005-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"York, Joanne; Agnihothram, Sudhakar S.; Romanowski, Victor; Nunberg, Jack H.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d2326c994b2c770150af0739dd4c17ea2488e22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173107.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205005209; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205005209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell fusion","arenavirus membrane fusion","viral fusion proteins","membrane fusion activity of Class","arenavirus GP-C","G2 fusion subunit","C-terminal region","arenavirus infection","positions","regions","cell surface","mutant glycoproteins","N-terminal region","important determinants of cell","Jun\u00EDn virus envelope glycoprotein GP-C","hydrophobic heptad","cleavage site","\u03B1-helical coiled-coil structures","I333","immunologic strategies","d position sidechains","putative interhelical","subtilisin kexin isozyme","L336","L347","alanine","Proteolytic maturation","SKI","S1P","L350","W395","helix bundle structure","R392","inclusion","hemorrhagic fever","results","protease","importance","mutagenesis","findings","role","mutants"],"language":"en"},

Methods We conducted a multi-stage sampling, cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from May to June, in 2014. The main outcome variable was residents\u2019 willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of vaccination willingness. Results Of the 7264 eligible participants, 14.5% of Beijing residents reported that they had not heard of H7N9. Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, and approximately half of them reported \u2018I am afraid of being infected by H7N9\u2019 and \u2018H7N9 vaccine can prevent infections\u2019, and 28.1% reported \u2018my daily life is affected by H7N9\u2019. The variables that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting willingness were being younger adults (aged 18\u201329 years: OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17\u20131.97; aged 30\u201339 years: OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08\u20131.78), being farmers (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.32\u20131.96), being unemployed people (OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.78), living in suburban areas (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.89\u20132.51), having \u22652 children in the family (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.92), perceived risk in China (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15\u20131.48), perceived susceptibility to disease (OR = 3.13; 95% CI: 2.73\u20133.58), perceived negative effect on daily life (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.55), perceived effectiveness of vaccination (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.07\u20132.64), and recent uptake of influenza vaccine (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.92\u20132.66). Conclusions A great number of Beijing residents had doubts about the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting willingness to be vaccinated. Targeted education programs on disease risk as well as vaccine\u2019s effectiveness are needed to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness.","publish_time":"2018-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Shuangsheng; Su, Jianting; Yang, Peng; Zhang, Haiyan; Li, Hongjun; Chu, Yanhui; Hua, Weiyu; Li, Chao; Tang, Yaqing; Wang, Quanyi","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6aeb8940f7cd316ba9493e2c1fbc63d973a6e66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246476/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17317462; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17317462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["future H7N9 vaccine","willingness of vaccination","residents\u2019 willingness","perceived risk","predictors of vaccination willingness","perceived effectiveness of vaccination","disease risk","potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness","vaccine\u2019s effectiveness","perceived susceptibility","higher likelihood of reporting willingness","general adult population","recent uptake of influenza vaccine","China","daily life","years","great number of Beijing residents","cross-sectional survey","multi-stage sampling","doubts","determinants","self-administered anonymous questionnaires","present study","Conclusions","younger adults","Targeted education programs","main outcome variable","eligible participants","Abstract Background","Methods","negative effect","factors","half","Results","infections\u2019","Logistic regression","unemployed people","suburban areas","children","family","variables","farmers"],"language":"en"},

Population-based incidence rates and comprehensive clinical characterizations of disease have not been established. METHODS: We conducted population-based prospective surveillance for HMPV in two U.S. counties among children \u003C5 years hospitalized with ARI or fever for two years. Nasal/throat swabs were tested for HMPV by real-time RT-PCR and genotyped. RESULTS: Forty-two of 1104 (3.8%) children tested positive for HMPV. The overall annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations per 1000 children \u003C5 years was 1.2 (95%CI 0.9\u20131.6). This rate was highest in infants 0\u20135 months (4.9/1000 [95%CI 2.9\u20137.2]), followed by children 6\u201311 months (2.9/1000 [95%CI 1.4\u20134.7]). The annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations was less than respiratory syncytial virus, but similar to influenza and parainfluenzavirus (PIV) 3 in all age groups. The mean age of children hospitalized with HMPV was 6 months. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma were the most common diagnoses in children with HMPV. All four HMPV subgroups were detected during both years at both sites. HPMV was most prominent from March through May.

Gels containing the nonionic polymer hydroxyethyl cellulose were loaded with concentrations of the diphosphate salt of chloroquine (0.3\u201330 mg/g), that were 102- to 104-fold higher than typical in vitro anti-HIV-1 IC50-values of chloroquine (ca. 6 \u03BCg/ml). The gels were clear and homogeneous and displayed an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg, a pH of 4.6 and a viscosity of 1.4 Pa s. Gel characteristics were preserved for at least 3 months at 40 \u00B0C and 75% relative humidity. Importantly, the chloroquine gels exerted a dose-dependent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro (mean IC50 from 23 to 0.4 mg gel/ml) and the intrinsic activity of chloroquine was not affected by formulation factors.

In this study, we present a simple and practical strategy to address these problems by conjugating ENF with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Site-specific attachment of a 2 kDa PEG at the N-terminus of ENF resulted in an ENF\u2212PEG (EP) conjugate with high solubility (\u22653 mg/mL) and long half-life in rats (T 1/2 = 16.1 h). This conjugate showed similar antiviral activity to ENF against various primary HIV-1 isolates (EC50 = 6\u201391 nM). Mechanistic studies suggested the sources of the antiviral potency. The conjugate bound to a functional domain of the HIV gp41 protein in a helical conformation with high affinity (K d = 307 nM), thereby inhibiting the gp41-mediated fusion of viral and host-cell membranes. As PEG conjugation has advanced many bioactive proteins and peptides into clinical applications, the EP conjugate described here represents a potential new treatment for HIV infections that may address the unmet medical needs associated with the current ENF therapy.","publish_time":"2016-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Shuihong; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Zhenxing; Lv, Xun; Gao, George F.; Shao, Yiming; Ma, Liying; Li, Xuebing","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f6ff7d1a5eea48cf17479882b42858d9527472c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240277/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523416304159; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523416304159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ENF","HIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current ENF therapy","EP conjugate","treatment of HIV infections","kDa PEG","PEG conjugation","HIV gp41 protein","various primary HIV","rats","high solubility","high affinity","therapy expensive","antiviral potency","low aqueous solubility","similar antiviral activity","potential new treatment","gp41-mediated fusion of viral","helical conformation","bioactive proteins","clinical applications","peptides","problems","unmet medical needs","poor pharmacokinetic profile","functional domain","N-terminus","host-cell membranes","sources","isolates","EC50","polyethylene glycol","peptide drug","practical strategy","Site-specific attachment","long half-life","inconvenience","Mechanistic studies","Abstract Enfuvirtide","study"],"language":"en"},

They are enhanced by burning of fossil fuels and the emission of huge amounts of CO(2) gas which resulted in greenhouse effect. It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2\u20135 \u00B0C in the next decades. As a result, the earth will exhibit marked climatic changes characterized by extremer weather events in the coming decades, such as the increase in temperature, rainfall, summertime, droughts, more frequent and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes. Epidemiological disease cycle includes host, pathogen and in certain cases intermediate host/vector. A complex mixture of various environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity) determines the suitable habitat/ecological niche for every vector host. The availability of suitable vectors is a precondition for the emergence of vector-borne pathogens. Climate changes and global warming will have catastrophic effects on human, animal and environmental ecosystems. Pathogens, especially neglected tropical disease agents, are expected to emerge and re-emerge in several countries including Europe and North America.

Most of the infectious diseases are caused by drug-resistant microbes; this may lead to a delay in the administration of microbiologically effective therapy (Chen et al., 2017; Del Chierico et al., 2014). Therefore, exhaustive understanding of microbial physiologies, infection and defense systems, and survival strategies is of great interest in order to actively defeat microbial infection. Microbial proteomics provides complete information of microbial physiology and expression and function of the proteins that are involved in infection and also gives a clue in clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy (P\u00E9rez-Llarena and Bou, 2016; Vranakis et al., 2014). Microbial proteomics helps to identify the proteins associated with microbial activity, microbial host-pathogen interactions, and antimicrobial resistant mechanism. Microbial activity of pathogens can be confirmed by using the 2-D gel-based and gel-free method with the combination of MALDI-TOF-LC-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis of microbial host-pathogen interaction reveals valuable information about the virulence of the pathogen and its resistance; it helps in better understanding of the infection and for developing strategies against microbial infections (Cheng et al., 2016).

Especially activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) produce large amounts of 1O2. Via activation of the respiratory burst (NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase) they synthesize hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chloramines (in particular N-chlorotaurine). Chloramines are selective and stable chemical generators of 1O2. In the human organism, 1O2 is both a signal and a weapon with therapeutic potency against very different pathogens, such as microbes, virus, cancer cells and thrombi. Chloramines at blood concentrations between 1 and 2 mmol/L inactivate lipid enveloped virus and chloramines at blood concentrations below 0.5 mmol/L, i.e. at oxidant concentrations that do not affect thrombocytes or hemostasis factors, act antithrombotically by activation of the physiologic PMN mediated fibrinolysis; this thrombolysis is of selective nature, i.e. it does not impair the hemostasis system of the patient allowing the antithrombotic treatment in patients where the current risky thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated. The action of 1O2 might be compared to the signaling and destroying gunfire of soldiers directed against bandits at night, resulting in an autorecruitment of the physiological inflammatory response. Chloramines (such as the mild and untoxic oxidant chloramine T(\u00AE) (N-chloro-p-toluene-sulfonamide)) and their signaling and destroying reaction product 1O2 might be promising new therapeutic agents against a multitude of up to now refractory diseases.","publish_time":"2003-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stief, Thomas W","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fe41c86dc4c8aa3c9c37bb6a0f2a6cb316feb59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157913.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987703000264; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987703000264","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chloramines","action of 1O2","reaction product 1O2","large amounts of 1O2","stable chemical generators of 1O2","blood concentrations","oxidant concentrations","activation","mmol","different cells","C\uE605O","Singlet oxygen","ground state oxygen","Reactive oxygen species","therapeutic potency","antithrombotic treatment","different pathogens","hemostasis factors","selective nature","hemostasis system","cancer cells","important ROS","lipid enveloped virus","new therapeutic agents","particular N-chlorotaurine","physiologic PMN mediated fibrinolysis","current risky thrombolytic treatment","untoxic oxidant chloramine T","patients","myeloperoxidase","thrombolysis","NADPH oxidase","multitude","respiratory burst","microbes","signal","thrombocytes","excited carbonyls","activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes","autorecruitment","molecule","p-toluene","nonradicalic","weapon","NaOCl","hypochlorite","bandits","night","physiological inflammatory response","light","photon","sulfonamide","thrombi","gunfire of soldiers","human organism","refractory diseases"],"language":"en"},

After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents. METHODS: We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arons, Melissa M.; Hatfield, Kelly M.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Kimball, Anne; James, Allison; Jacobs, Jesica R.; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C.; Oakley, Lisa P.; Tanwar, Sukarma; Dyal, Jonathan W.; Harney, Josh; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M.; Methner, Mark; Paul, Prabasaj; Carlson, Christina M.; McLaughlin, Heather P.; Thornburg, Natalie; Tong, Suxiang; Tamin, Azaibi; Tao, Ying; Uehara, Anna; Harcourt, Jennifer; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C.; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Montgomery, Patty; Stone, Nimalie D.; Clark, Thomas A.; Honein, Margaret A.; Duchin, Jeffrey S.; Jernigan, John A.","journal":"N Engl J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e10a00df9101c78210ce70041a806ec18929c08c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/648f6daa459a53c500f563d931870f602c03ff38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329971/; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2008457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Asymptomatic residents","presymptomatic residents","SARS-CoV","half of residents","skilled nursing facility","widespread transmission of SARS","days","positive test results","time of testing","skilled nursing facilities","median time","atypical symptoms","oropharyngeal testing","Infection-control strategies","serial point-prevalence surveys","median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","BACKGROUND","cough","based screening","fever","adequacy of symptom","shortness of breath","viral culture","infections","week","onset","viable virus","clusters","case of Covid","CONCLUSIONS","introduction","intensive care unit","difference","nucleotide","identification","sequencing","METHODS","Samples","sequences","specimens","mortality"],"language":"en"},

We have recently shown that indomethacin activates the double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA)\u2010dependent protein kinase R (PKR) in human colon cancer cells. Because of the important role of PKR in the cellular defence response against viral infection, herein we investigated the effect of indomethacin on PKR activity during infection with the prototype rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus. Indomethacin was found to activate PKR in an interferon\u2010 and dsRNA\u2010independent manner, causing rapid (\u003C 5 min) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor\u20102 \u03B1\u2010subunit (eIF2\u03B1). These events resulted in shutting off viral protein translation and blocking viral replication (IC (50) = 2 \u03BCM) while protecting host cells from virus\u2010induced damage. Indomethacin did not affect eIF2\u03B1 kinases PKR\u2010like endoplasmic reticulum\u2010resident protein kinase (PERK) and general control non\u2010derepressible\u20102 (GCN2) kinase, and was unable to trigger eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation in the presence of PKR inhibitor 2\u2010aminopurine. In addition, small\u2010interfering RNA\u2010mediated PKR gene silencing dampened the antiviral effect in indomethacin\u2010treated cells. The results identify PKR as a critical target for the antiviral activity of indomethacin and indicate that eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation could be a key element in the broad spectrum antiviral activity of the drug.","publish_time":"2015-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amici, Carla; La Frazia, Simone; Brunelli, Claudia; Balsamo, Mirna; Angelini, Mara; Santoro, M.

It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy among them and promoting an effective technique to reuse them. Methods A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and from 25 top cited papers, 15 were selected for relevance and impact. Results Most studies on prior respiratory virus epidemic to date suggest surgical masks not to be inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among health care workers. The use of N95 respirators should be then limited in favor of high-risk situations. Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target. Conclusions Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help facing PPE shortening during a pandemic. Further evidences testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need. The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning: these groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bo\u0161koski, Ivo; Gallo, Camilla; Wallace, Michael B.; Costamagna, Guido","journal":"Gastrointest Endosc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38e049ebd6e732ed54e8524c0d9dd6f14c6aeb00.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353457/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016510720342474?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016510720342474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respirators reuse","use of N95 respirators","N95 respirators decontamination","PPE rational use","successful reuse of respirators","Conclusions Rational use","terms of protective efficacy","terms of efficacy","UVGI","health care systems","health care workers","decontamination techniques","high-risk patients","pandemic issues","viral respiratory agents","personal protective equipment","favor of high-risk situations","prior respiratory virus epidemic","energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation","date","world","possible differences","surgical masks","PubMed","Google Scholar","Scopus","Cochrane database","deep learning","artificial intelligence","groundbreaking modalities","rapid spread","type of respirator","careful consideration","time","abrupt outbreak of COVID","studies","appropriate types","literature search","consumption","implementation","Abstract Background","cited papers","definitive answer","unmet need","evidences","biological target","relevance","production","Methods","effective technique","impact","reduction"],"language":"en"},

Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of S1 genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The hypervariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the S1 gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3\u0027 end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for recombination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wang; Junker, Dave; Hock, Lisa; Ebiary, Elham; Collisson, Ellen W.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/020d76b46fd89983f3092d4e16e2d32c9a76df9c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170294901325; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170294901325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","IBV"],"locations":["Europe","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Dutch strains","Iowa strains","additional American strains","Mass","American group","European groups","hypervariable region","distinct strains of infectious bronchitis virus","published nucleotide sequence of S1 genes of strains","European strain","distinct groups","Dutch group","identity","HVR","S1 gene of PP14","putative recombination events","corresponding gene","evolution of IBV","divergent sharing","used mechanism responsible","deletions","Holte","insertions","USA","report","broad genetic background","similar shifts","point mutations","homology","SE17","Japan","Gray","large number","sites","serotype","amino acid residue","Comparisons","sequences","coronavirus variation","hot-spot","minor cross","end","Ark"],"language":"en"},

It belongs to the tetraspanin family whose members form dynamic clusters with numerous partner proteins and with one another, forming tetraspanin\u2010enriched areas in the plasma membrane. In our study, we combined single\u2010molecule microscopy and biochemistry experiments to investigate the clustering and membrane behaviour of CD81 in the context of cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, a natural inhibitor of HCV entry. Interestingly, we found that EWI\u20102wint reduces the global diffusion of CD81 molecules due to a decrease of the diffusion rate of mobile CD81molecules and an increase in the proportion of confined molecules. Indeed, we demonstrated that EWI\u20102wint promotes CD81 clustering and confinement in CD81\u2010enriched areas. In addition, we showed that EWI\u20102wint influences the colocalization of CD81 with Claudin\u20101 \u2013 a co\u2010receptor required for HCV entry. Together, our results indicate that a change in membrane partitioning of CD81 occurs in the presence of EWI\u20102wint.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures. METHODS: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. RESULTS: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R \u003E 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number R \u003C 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines. The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020. After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

Immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. The microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. However, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. Potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four Danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. Furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for E. coli, C. perfringens and C. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. However, Enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. Furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. These bacteria were identified as E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. These bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.","publish_time":"2014-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonach, Beata; Boye, Mette; Stockmarr, Anders; Jensen, Tim K\u00E5re","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a11b3479a9f0e004870ecefa643c4c311c6066cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3995547.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-68; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neonatal piglets","outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea","non-diarrheic piglets","pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea","diagnosis of diarrhea","mortality of piglets","suckling piglets","groups of piglets","possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea","Enterococcus","increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases","adherent bacteria","well-known enteric pathogens","common pathogens","pathogenic bacteria","intestinal mucosa","mentioned pathogens","adherent non-ETEC","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","well-known enteric agents","pig farms","presence","study","RESULTS","established casual agents","Danish farms","established microbiota","Clostridium perfringens type C","pig industry","increased morbidity","fixed intestinal tissue samples","detection of common","prevalence of fluorescence signals specific","multifactorial condition","Giardia","lack","Cryptosporidium","rotavirus","coronavirus","birth","oligonucleotide probes","economic losses","simultaneous colonization","infection","Cystoisospora suis","Immature immune system","situ hybridization","focus","research","enteritis","Strongyloides ransomi","recent years","histopathological changes","histological lesions","role of","BACKGROUND","decades","primary aim","CONCLUSIONS","association","microorganisms"],"language":"en"},

Methods Fifty-eight adult patients diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis were evaluated from September 2011 through June 2012. A control group of 61 adult patients without allergy was included. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect respiratory viruses in nasal lavage samples. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 25 of 58 patients (43.1%) with perennial allergic rhinitis, but in only 15 of 61 control patients (24.6%). In virus-positive samples, multiple viruses were detected in 9 of 25 patients (36.0%) with perennial allergic rhinitis but in only 2 of 15 control patients (12.5%). Rhinovirus was the most common virus in patients without allergy and those with allergic rhinitis. There were significant differences in the detection rates of overall and multiple respiratory viruses and rhinovirus between the 2 groups (P \u003C .05). However, in patients with allergic rhinitis, there was no statistically significant association between the detection of respiratory viruses and symptom scores.

Immunological mechanisms in the eye must be tightly regulated to ensure externally mediated injury and infection or internally mediated autoimmunity do not exceed self-defence tolerance. Vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) and their receptors exist in the mammalian eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process and the retina and may have a role in protecting these normally immune privileged sites. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP pathway. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival hence vascular compromise will have serious consequences. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the blood retina barrier (BRB) may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them. Protection from BRB breakdown may be linked to nitric oxide (NO) effects and actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cAMP production. Induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology. PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation. Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened. Importantly for therapeutic contexts cAMP effects are maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors which could be used in VN autoimmune disorders. A compelling case may exist to undertake a therapeutic trial of VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other agents in autoimmune retinopathies resulting from possible VN autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Staines, Donald R.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/903f8d72ea961ab2c4c0bad918fe78f6aaedf9cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130865.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987707002964; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987707002964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VN receptors","retinal injury","retinal survival","retinal viability","Retinal vasculitis","retinal pathology","Additional effects of VN compromise","VN autoimmune disorders","possible VN autoimmunity","PACAP","therapeutic trial of VN replacement","cultured retinal neurons","PDE inhibitors","vascular compromise","mediated autoimmunity","inflammatory responses","influences of inflammatory mediators","therapeutic contexts cAMP effects","autoimmune retinopathies","actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors","glutamate toxicity","VNs","mediated injury","systemic inflammatory diseases","role","mammalian eye","inflammation","prevention of autoimmune retinopathy","blood retina barrier","number of therapeutic pathways","ciliary body","ciliary process","Vasoactive neuropeptides","serious consequences","cyclase polypeptide","cAMP production","vasoactive intestinal peptide","serious ocular disease","sound blood supply","Summary Immune privilege","immune privileged sites","significant detrimental impact","treatment","strong association","VIP","iris","cornea","pituitary","blindness","retinohypothalamic tract","agents","G protein","neurotoxicity","important implications","blinding condition","cell apoptosis","physiologic mechanism","sclera","neurodegeneration","endothelial barriers","class","hypothesis","chain of events","infection","cyclic AMP pathway","nitric oxide","unopposed vasoconstriction","breakdown","Proof","GPCRs","self-defence tolerance","manner","Immunological mechanisms","compelling case","Protection","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Such an introduction through travelling led to the emergence of a MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea in May 2015, which caused more than 140 confirmed human cases in less than a month. Using 70 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates, including the most recent sequences for the Korean and Chinese isolates, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the complete genome and the individual protein coding regions. The Korean MERS-CoV strain clustered in the previously established Hafr-Al-Batin-1_2013 clade together with two Saudi Arabian and one Chinese strain sampled in 2015. Although these four strains remained monophyletic in the entire protein-coding region, this clade showed different phylogenetic relationships across the genome, indicating a shared unique recombination pattern that is different from previously reported putative recombination strains.

It is unclear, however, whether cellular mRNA turnover pathways are engaged to assist in this process. In Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus this phenotype is enacted by the host shutoff factor SOX. Here we show that SOX-induced mRNA turnover is a two-step process, in which mRNAs are first cleaved internally by SOX itself then degraded by the cellular exonuclease Xrn1. SOX therefore bypasses the regulatory steps of deadenylation and decapping normally required for Xrn1 activation. SOX is likely recruited to translating mRNAs, as it cosediments with translation initiation complexes and depletes polysomes. Cleaved mRNA intermediates accumulate in the 40S fraction, indicating that recognition occurs at an early stage of translation. This is the first example of a viral protein commandeering cellular mRNA turnover pathways to destroy host mRNAs, and suggests that Xrn1 is poised to deplete messages undergoing translation in mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2011-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Covarrubias, Sergio; Gaglia, Marta M.; Kumar, G.

The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morrison, Brian J.; Roman, Jessica A.; Luke, Thomas C.; Nagabhushana, Nishith; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Williams, Maya; Sun, Peifang","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55842395e936997104291e3243df85c7ffdffec9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113754.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417302525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417302525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624584/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","HAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza plasma","influenza treatment","influenza infections","sustained NK cell activation","sustained NK cell degranulation","NK cells","antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation assay","effector cell degranulation","seasonal influenza vaccine","high HAI titers","hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses","antibody therapies","viral infection","influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin","antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity","prime ADCC","marker of ADCC","plasma samples","limited assessment of protection","entire breadth of antibody responses","non-radioactive assay","opsonized viral antigen","concentration of neutralizing antibodies","surface of infected Raji target cells","potential utility","following receipt","biomarker","vital role","current determinant","surrogate CD107a expression","therapy","positive correlation","study","Previous reports"],"language":"en"},

Altogether our results indicate that a recombinant trimeric S protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in vivo and warrant concern in the safety evaluation of a human vaccine against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2007-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kam, Yiu Wing; Kien, Fran\u00E7ois; Roberts, Anjeanette; Cheung, Yan Chung; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Vogel, Leatrice; Chu, Shui Ling; Tse, Jane; Guarner, Jeannette; Zaki, Sherif R.; Subbarao, Kanta; Peiris, Malik; Nal, B\u00E9atrice; Altmeyer, Ralf","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1015d416b34e81158ed814fcae420fd72ebceca4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115629.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06009534; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06009534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralized SARS-CoV infection","ADE of virus entry","novel cell entry mechanism of SARS","recombinant trimeric S protein","recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer","capacity of anti-S antibodies","human vaccine","immunized animals","Vaccinated animals","efficacious protective immune response","antibody-dependent enhancement","ACE2 receptor","Fc\u03B3RII-dependent","human B cell lines","specific serum","enhancement of replication","Abstract Vaccine-induced antibodies","case of feline infectious peritonitis virus","ACE2-independent fashion","Serum IgG blocked binding","triSpike","hepatitis","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","signs of enhanced lung pathology","warrant concern","viral load","safety evaluation","mucosal immunoglobulins","infections","neutralizing","lungs","coronaviruses","results","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide.

The virus replication cycle generates new viral genomes and proteins in sufficient quantities to ensure propagation of the viral genome; this requires that the extracellular viral genome is protected from enzymatic degradation and can be introduced into further target cells for further rounds of replication. The initial recognition between virus and host is more complex than originally supposed and may involve more than one cellular receptor. A critical first intracellular step is the generation of viral mRNA by one of a limited number of strategies first described by David Baltimore. Lacking ribosomes, viruses have no means of producing protein and are reliant on the host cell for protein synthesis. Viral proteins are often modified by host cell glycosylation during or after virus assembly. Temporal regulation of intracellular events is critical in all but the very simplest of viruses, and some form of suppression of the host innate immune response is common to nearly all human viruses. Infected cells often produce non-infectious particles with incomplete genomes, and these defective interfering particles may play a role in pathogenesis. Understanding these processes will open up a range of targets for the development of novel therapies.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burrell, Christopher J.; Howard, Colin R.; Murphy, Frederick A.","journal":"Fenner and White\u0027s Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/418f3fc7ac3a652b7f09ad016fcf598e27a9e241.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173592.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751560000047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751560000047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["David Baltimore"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral proteins","virus replication cycle","virus assembly","virus diseases","new viral genomes","extracellular viral genome","generation of viral mRNA","host cell glycosylation","rounds of replication","human viruses","simplest of viruses","proper understanding","incomplete genomes","non-infectious particles","molecular events","intracellular step","Temporal regulation of intracellular events","protein synthesis","Infected cells","target cells","defective interfering particles","sufficient quantities","means","control","propagation","immune response","form of suppression","limited number of strategies","role","range of targets","enzymatic degradation","development of novel therapies","Lacking ribosomes","Abstract","initial recognition","David Baltimore","pathogenesis","cellular receptor","processes"],"language":"en"},

The majority displayed a moderate attitude toward hand hygiene (52.1%), while only a few reported a poor attitude (13.1%). Approximately 68.7%, 29.8%, and 1.5% of the respondents reported moderate, good, and poor practice of hand hygiene, respectively. Having a good attitude toward hand hygiene, being male, being aware that hand hygiene is an effective intervention in preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), attendance at hand hygiene trainings and seminars, and being in the lower academic level of nursing education were identified as predictors of better hand hygiene practice. The importance of ensuring a positive attitude toward hand hygiene and improving awareness of hand hygiene is emphasized, as are educational interventions.

The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients\u2019 stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hui; Li, Hong-Bao; Lyu, Jian-Rui; Lei, Xiao-Ming; Li, Wei; Wu, Gang; Lyu, Jun; Dai, Zhi-Ming","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecfc7e03c5ae929185123b1e77b8a9316e3ad728.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302381?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311451/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Associated"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","clinical symptoms","suspected patients","possible mechanism of digestive symptoms","ACE2 expression patterns","High expression of ACE2","nCoV-infected patients","incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms","ACE2 mRNA","surface cells","digestive tract","goblet cells","small intestine","intestinal immune cells","small intestinal enterocytes","activation of gastrointestinal inflammation","clinical data","notable proportion of COVID","coronavirus disease","patients\u2019 stool samples","novel coronavirus","inflammation susceptibility","assessment of disease status","severe acute respiratory syndrome","early diagnosis","relationship","different human organs","major known functional receptor","published studies","death","necessity","amplification","invasion","protein","presence","fever","online datasets","systemic manifestations","results","unknown significance","China","diarrhea","Wuhan","countries","study","attention"],"language":"en"},

From a review of the events as publicly reported, we find, as suggested by garbage can theory, that politicians\u2019 and administrators\u2019 responses to the SARS outbreak were a combination of competing rationalities and overlapping agendas.

The small airways (bronchioles with inner diameters \u003C2 mm), located at the transitional zone between larger conducting airways and the pulmonary acinus, have been overlooked as major contributors to clinical syndromes of respiratory disease in cats. Because the trigger for many bronchiolar disorders is environmental and humans live in a shared environment with similar susceptibility, understanding these diseases in pet cats has relevance to One Health. Thoracic radiography, the major imaging modality used in the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory disease in cats, has low utility in detection of bronchiolar disease. Computed tomography (CT) with paired inspiratory and expiratory scans can detect pathology centered on small airways. In humans, treatment of bronchiolar disorders is not well established because of heterogeneous presentations and often late definitive diagnosis. A review of the human and veterinary medical literature will serve as the basis for a proposed classification scheme in cats. A case series of cats with CT or histopathologic evidence of bronchiolar lesions or both, either as a primary disorder or secondary to extension from large airway disease or interstitial lung disease, will be presented. Future multi\u2010institutional and multidisciplinary discussions among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will help refine and develop this classification scheme to promote early and specific recognition and optimize treatment.","publish_time":"2019-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reinero, Carol R.; Masseau, Isabelle; Grobman, Megan; Vientos\u2010Plotts, Aida; Williams, Kurt","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79e75fc82b515edcb68d6c8a6b83d630e3b21193.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6524100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982233/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of bronchiolar disease","pet cats","secondary bronchiolar disorders","treatment of bronchiolar disorders","case series of cats","diagnostic evaluation of respiratory disease","small airways","large airway disease","interstitial lung disease","proposed classification scheme","clinical syndromes of respiratory disease","histopathologic evidence of bronchiolar lesions","literature review","humans","larger conducting airways","veterinary medical literature","major contributors","primary disorder","case examples","key diagnostic tests","major imaging modality","Veterinary Medicine article","extension","low utility","clinicians","multidisciplinary discussions","support","expiratory scans","diseases","pathology","basis","similar susceptibility","heterogeneous presentations","shared environment","pulmonary acinus","specific recognition","late definitive diagnosis","radiologists","Thoracic radiography","putative causes","transitional zone","relevance","bronchioles","inner diameters","Computed tomography","Perspectives","Health","trigger","pathologists"],"language":"en"},

The analysis points thus to the influence of different evolutive constraints in these two close groups.","publish_time":"2016-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"KIN, Nathalie; Miszczak, Fabien; Diancourt, Laure; Caro, Val\u00E9rie; Moutou, Fran\u00E7ois; Vabret, Astrid; Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc19f974722f3845f323c607ba028bd93af6ec73.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d2991417c8034521957cb689fbace5d46aa29b16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106199.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969241/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816300776; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816300776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Normandy","America","Asia","Europe","France"],"keyphrases":["BCoVs","Sub-cluster C","French HCoV-OC43s","main sub-clusters","attenuated BCoV strains","complete genome sequences available","sequence data","influence of different evolutive constraints","monophyletic status","world","prototype","relative genetic stability","respiratory infections","GenBank","vaccine","Normandy","samples","France","close groups","cattle","phylogenetic analyses","current study","Bovine coronaviruses","numerous recombination","America","analysis points","genotyping method","year period","Asia","time","Europe","region"],"language":"en"},

Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg \u201Cwindow stage\u201D, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The \u201Csandwich\u201D therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these \u201Csandwich\u201D-treated mice.

In the developed world, some pandemic preparedness plans have already been examined from an ethical viewpoint. This paper assesses the attention given to ethics issues by the Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza (NISPPI). METHODS: We critically analyzed the Ghana NISPPI\u2019s sensitivity to ethics issues to determine how well it reflects ethical commitments and principles identified in our review of global pandemic preparedness literature, existing pandemic plans, and relevant ethics frameworks. RESULTS: This paper reveals that important ethical issues have not been addressed in the Ghana NISPPI. Several important ethical issues are unanticipated, unacknowledged, and unplanned for. These include guidelines on allocation of scarce resources, the duties of healthcare workers, ethics-sensitive operational guidelines/protocols, and compensation programs. The NISPPI also pays scant attention to use of vaccines and antivirals, border issues and cooperation with neighboring countries, justification for delineated actions, and outbreak simulations. Feedback and communication plans are nebulous, while leadership, coordination, and budgeting are quite detailed. With respect to presentation, the NISPPI\u2019s text is organized around five thematic areas. While each area implicates ethical issues, NISPPI treatment of these areas consistently fails to address them. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration of ethics by the NISPPI. We contend that, while the plan\u2019s content and fundamental assumptions provide support for implementation of the delineated public health actions, its consideration of ethical issues is poor. Deficiencies include a failure to incorporate guidelines that ensure fair distribution of scarce resources and a lack of justification for delineated procedures. Until these deficiencies are recognized and addressed, Ghana runs the risk of rolling out unjust and ethically indefensible actions with real negative effects in the event of a pandemic. Soliciting inputs from the public and consultation with ethicists during the next revision of the NISPPI will be useful in addressing these issues.","publish_time":"2015-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laar, Amos; DeBruin, Debra","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be86d94be6483de622f67e0c098684e4982c0441.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4427965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25947354/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-015-0025-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ghana National Integrated","NISPPI"],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["ethics issues","consideration of ethical issues","important ethical issues","border issues","ethical approach","ethical commitments","ethical viewpoint","Pandemic Influenza","NISPPI treatment","pandemic preparedness plans","existing pandemic plans","delineated actions","ethics-sensitive operational guidelines","relevant ethics frameworks","Ghana NISPPI\u2019s sensitivity","delineated public health actions","review of global pandemic preparedness literature","indefensible actions","lack of justification","lack of consideration","communication plans","delineated procedures","paper","Deficiencies","allocation of scarce resources","Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan","fair distribution of scarce resources","influenza pandemics","NISPPI\u2019s text","scant attention","thematic areas","support","implementation","neighboring countries","duties of healthcare workers","cooperation","protocols","real negative effects","fundamental assumptions","leadership","vaccines","antivirals","coordination","plan\u2019s content","consultation","event","revision","principles","planning","developed world","compensation programs","outbreak simulations","budgeting","respect","presentation","ethicists","Feedback","analysis","commentators","failure","inputs","CONCLUSIONS","risk","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In the present work, we have elucidated the mechanism of binding of two inhibitors, namely \u03B1-ketoamide and Z31792168, to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We calculated the total binding free energy (\u0394Gbind) of both inhibitors and further decomposed \u0394Gbind into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. Our calculations reveal that \u03B1-ketoamide is more potent (\u0394Gbind= - 9.05 kcal/mol) compared to Z31792168 (\u0394Gbind= - 3.25 kcal/mol) against COVID-19 3CLpro. The increase in \u0394Gbind for \u03B1-ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CLpro. Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CLpro-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy. Finally, we have compared \u0394Gbind of these two inhibitors with the anti-HIV retroviral drugs, such as lopinavir and darunavir. It is observed that \u03B1-ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir. In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to \u03B1-ketoamide. On the other hand, in the case of darunavir, a decrease in the favorable intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contributes to lower affinity compared to \u03B1-ketoamide. Our study might help in designing rational anti-coronaviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sk, Md Fulbabu; Roy, Rajarshi; Jonniya, Nisha Amarnath; Poddar, Sayan; Kar, Parimal","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1768149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1-ketoamide relative","decomposed \u0394Gbind","CLpro-ligand binding","Waals interactions","inhibitors","lower binding affinity","total binding free energy","mechanism of binding","Z31792168","van","free energy calculations","case of lopinavir","case of darunavir","SARS-CoV","lower affinity","decrease","main protease","kcal","increase","COVID","Molecular Mechanics","rational anti-coronaviral drugs","anti-HIV retroviral drugs","all-atom molecular dynamics simulations","Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area","complex formation","various forces","coronavirus disease","decomposition","recent outbreak of novel","PBSA","Mpro","important residues","method","study","hand","present work","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge= 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death=28). All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values. The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively. As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3\u002B T-cell, CD4\u002B T-cell, CD8\u002B T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (\u003C500), CD3\u002BT-cell (\u003C200), CD4\u002B T-cell (\u003C100), CD8\u002B T-cell (\u003C100) and B-cell (\u003C50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19. The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3\u002B T-cell, CD4\u002B T-cell, CD8\u002B T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively. CONCLUSION: We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"XU, Bo; FAN, Cun-yu; WANG, An-lu; ZOU, Yi-long; YU, Yi-han; HE, Cong; XIA, Wen-guang; ZHANG, Ji-xian; MIAO, Qing","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34bb7c0b70a65346092067f7c0983de1f92ef5e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166040.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302231; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302231?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["T-cell","T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte","counts of T lymphocyte","associations of T lymphocyte subsets","hospital death of lymphocyte","significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets","significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets","B-cell","decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets","median lymphocyte","hospital adult patients","hospital death of CIVID","severity of COVID","mild-ill patients","confirmed COVID","treatment of COVID","early diagnosis of COVID","CD3","CD4","CD8","increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients","warning values","Lower counts","ongoing outbreak of COVID","Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese","significant threats","early intervention","early warning of high risks of mortality","CRP","median concentrations of SAA","normal values","discharge","single-center observational study","higher risks","clinical practice","non-survivors","severity of illness","admission","Western medicine","univariate logistic regression","laboratory information","Receiver Operator Characteristic","possible biomarkers","odds ratios","Wuhan","retrospective","light","confidence intervals","virus infection","ROC","curves","SARS","CIs","China","Demographic","IMPORTANCE","findings","fold","world","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Air medical movement of individuals with potential infectious disease poses unique challenges and threats to crews and receiving personnel. The US Department of Health and Human Services air medical evacuation teams of the National Disaster Medical System directly supported 39 flights, moving over 2,000 individuals. Infection control precautions focused on source and engineering controls, personal protective equipment, safe work practices to limit contamination, and containment of the area of potential contamination. Source control to limit transmission distance was used by requiring all passengers to wear masks (surgical masks for persons under investigation and N95 for known positives). Engineering controls used plastic sheeting to segregate and treat patients who developed symptoms while airborne. Crews used Tyvek (Dupont Richmond, VA) suits with booties and a hood, a double layer of gloves, and either a powered air-purifying respirator or an N95 mask with a face shield. For those outside the 6-ft range, an N95 mask and gloves were worn. Safe work practices were used, which included mandatory aircraft surface decontamination, airflow exchanges, and designated lavatories. Although most patients transported were stable, to the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest repatriation of potentially contagious patients in history without infection of any transporting US Department of Health and Human Services air medical evacuation crews.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cornelius, Brian; Cornelius, Angela; Crisafi, Leah; Collins, Christine; McCarthy, Stacy; Foster, Corrine; Shannon, Heather; Bennett, Ray; Brown, Steven; Rodriguez, Kristy; Bachini, Steven","journal":"Air Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/059b03bcbe47339da558031d8e62271582d2ea2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204761.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067991X20300766; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2020.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067991X20300766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Department of Health and Human Services","VA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human Services air medical evacuation crews","Air medical movement of individuals","Human Services air medical evacuation teams","powered air","N95 mask","transporting US Department of Health","engineering controls","safe work practices","Source control","contagious patients","National Disaster Medical System","potential infectious disease","health care systems","area of potential contamination","Infection control precautions","unique challenges","surgical masks","double layer of gloves","Abstract Recent coronavirus disease","personal protective equipment","airflow exchanges","investigation","persons","history","threats","mandatory aircraft surface decontamination","Dupont Richmond","booties","suits","hood","COVID","containment","largest repatriation","Tyvek","passengers","events","flights","plastic sheeting","respirator","designated lavatories","known positives","transmission distance","ft range","knowledge","face shield","best","symptoms","personnel"],"language":"en"},

Since diabetes is a risk factor for many infectious diseases, this increase probably adds to the large infectious disease burden in tropical countries. We reviewed the literature to investigate the interface between diabetes and infections in tropical countries, including the WHO-defined neglected tropical diseases. Although solid data are sparse, patients with diabetes living in tropical countries most likely face increased risks of common and health-care-associated infections, as well as infected foot ulcers, which often lead to amputation. There is strong evidence that diabetes increases the severity of some endemic infections such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, and dengue virus infection. Some HIV and antiparasitic drugs might induce diabetes, whereas helminth infections appear to afford some protection against future diabetes. But there are no or very scarce data for most tropical infections and for possible biological mechanisms underlying associations with diabetes. The rise in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases puts a heavy toll on health systems in tropical countries. On the other hand, complications common to both diabetes and some tropical infections might provide an opportunity for shared services\u2014for example, for eye health (trachoma and onchocerciasis), ulcer care (leprosy), or renal support (schistosomiasis). More research about the interaction of diabetes and infections in tropical countries is needed, and the infectious disease burden in these countries is another reason to step up global efforts to improve prevention and care for diabetes.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Crevel, Reinout; van de Vijver, Steven; Moore, David A J","journal":"Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54af3d15bb29e95558c214ebe5d7e3631cff25c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-8587(16)30081-x; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221385871630081X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221385871630081X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tropical infections","Tropical countries","interaction of diabetes","future diabetes","neglected tropical diseases","endemic infections","associated infections","helminth infections","health-care","infectious diseases","eye health","health systems","ulcer care","large infectious disease burden","non-communicable diseases","substantial rise","complications common","solid data","scarce data","increased risks of common","heavy toll","example","melioidosis","onchocerciasis","trachoma","possible biological mechanisms","patients","leprosy","tuberculosis","opportunity","severity","shared services","global efforts","associations","reason","prevention","protection","risk factor","dengue virus infection","interface","renal support","antiparasitic drugs","infected foot ulcers","HIV","strong evidence","hand","type","schistosomiasis","literature","research","amputation"],"language":"en"},

These RNA viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In addition, swine and avian influenza viruses, together with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, represent significant pandemic threats to the general population. In this review, we describe the current medical need resulting from respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses, which justifies drug discovery efforts to identify new therapeutic agents. The RNA polymerase of respiratory viruses represents an attractive target for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs acting as inhibitors of RNA chain synthesis. Here, we present the molecular, biochemical, and structural fundamentals of the polymerase of the four major families of RNA respiratory viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae/Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We summarize past and current efforts to develop nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents against respiratory virus infections.

Chitosan is a natural, low-cost, and nontoxic elicitor that can trigger plant defense responses with the concomitant enhancement in phytochemical biosynthesis. In this work, the elicitation of Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures by chitosan was conducted to enhance the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. In comparison with control (2.31 \u00B1 0.29 mg/g DW), a 7.08-fold enhancement of total flavonoids (16.35 \u00B1 0.88 mg/g DW) was achieved in 24 day-old I. tinctoria hairy root cultures elicited by 150 mg/L chitosan for 36 h. Interestingly, the multiple hydroxyl-substituted \uFB02avonoids (rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and isoliquiritigenin) were noticed to increase significantly in chitosan-elicited I. tinctoria hairy root cultures. Moreover, the transcription of associated genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was significantly up-regulated underlying chitosan elicitation, among which chalcone synthase and flavonoid 3\u2032-hydroxylase might play an important role in flavonoid enhancement. Additionally, extracts from chitosan-elicited I. tinctoria hairy root cultures exhibited higher antioxidant activities with lower IC50 values as compared with control. Overall, a cost-effective strategy via the simple chitosan elicitation is provided here to enhance the production of high-added value flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, which paves the way toward the successful commercialization of this in vitro culture system in the future.","publish_time":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Jiao; Gai, Qing-Yan; Wang, Xin; Qin, Qi-Ping; Wang, Zi-Ying; Liu, Jing; Fu, Yu-Jie","journal":"Industrial Crops and Products","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e9f863b665cf922156b7669d0ae9f6dfb70a147.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288267/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669018306575; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669018306575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.07.056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tinctoria hairy root cultures","chitosan-elicited","underlying chitosan elicitation","simple chitosan elicitation","flavonoid enhancement","elicitation of Isatis tinctoria","phytochemical enhancement","concomitant enhancement","Abstract Elicitation","fold enhancement of total flavonoids","value flavonoids","phytochemical biosynthesis","flavonoid biosynthesis pathway","active flavonoids","control","g DW","plant cell","cost-effective elicitors","cost-effective strategy","culture system","production of high","plant defense responses","organ culture technology","higher antioxidant activities","lower IC50 values","rutin","nontoxic elicitor","quercetin","limitation of commercial application","multiple hydroxyl-substituted \uFB02avonoids","chalcone synthase","transcription of associated genes","isorhamnetin","successful commercialization","hydroxylase","important role","work","extracts","isoliquiritigenin","future","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Among these, cryptosporidiosis is an emerging waterborne zoonoses and one of the important causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea.

In the present study, faecal samples from 100 diarrhoeic calves randomly picked up out of 17 outbreaks of bovine calf diarrhoea in periurban Ludhiana, Punjab in Northern India were subjected to conventional (microscopy, modified Zeihl\u2013Neelsen (mZN) staining) and immunological and molecular techniques (faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR) for detection of primary Cryptosporidium parvum infection as well as other frequently reported concurrent pathogens, viz. rotavirus and coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Eimeria spp. The faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR revealed 35% prevalence of C. parvum in contrast to 25% by mZN staining with a relatively higher prevalence (66\u00B77%) in younger (8\u201314-day-old) calves. The detection rate of the other enteropathogens associated with C. parvum was 45\u00B771% for C. perfringens followed by Salmonella spp (40\u00B70%), rotavirus (36\u00B70%), coronavirus (16\u00B70%), E. coli (12\u00B70%) and Eimeria spp (4\u00B70%) The sensitivity for detection of C. parvum by ELISA and mZN staining in comparison to PCR was 97\u00B714% and 72\u00B772%, respectively. An important finding of the study was that C. parvum alone was found in only 10% of the diarrhoeic faecal samples, whereas, majority of the samples (90%) showed mixed infections ranging from a combination of two to five agents.

The contribution of filter penetration and faceseal leakage to total inward leakage (TIL) of submicron-size bioaerosols is not well studied. To address this issue, TIL values for two N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) models and two surgical mask (SM) models sealed to a manikin were measured at 8 L and 40 L breathing minute volumes with different artificial leak sizes. TIL values for different size (20\u2013800 nm, electrical mobility diameter) NaCl particles representing submicron-size bioaerosols were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Efficiency of filtering devices was assessed by measuring the penetration against NaCl aerosol similar to the method used for NIOSH particulate filter certification. Results showed that the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) was ~45 nm for both N95 FFR models and one of the two SM models, and ~350 nm for the other SM model at sealed condition with no leaks as well as with different leak sizes. TIL values increased with increasing leak sizes and breathing minute volumes. Relatively, higher efficiency N95 and SM models showed lower TIL values. Filter efficiency of FFRs and SMs influenced the TIL at different flow rates and leak sizes. Overall, the data indicate that good fitting higher-efficiency FFRs may offer higher protection against submicron-size bioaerosols.","publish_time":"2013-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rengasamy, Samy; Eimer, Benjamin C.; Szalajda, Jonathan","journal":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6e2c8e5c1c021433a0cdde2de04bd7971eb74f4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fcfd568efdcf55232aaedd2b48991d58d32653aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4589201.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275016/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4589201?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2013.866715","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SM models","different size","different leak sizes","faceseal leakage","contribution of filter penetration","Filter efficiency of FFRs","submicron-size bioaerosols","lower TIL values","penetration of particles","N95 FFR models","higher efficiency N95","different artificial leak sizes","higher protection","function of particle penetration","nm","filter media","increasing leak sizes","penetrating particle size","faceseal leaks","particulate respirator","inward leakage","Efficiency of filtering devices","N95 filtering facepiece respirator","NIOSH particulate filter certification","good fitting higher-efficiency FFRs","NaCl particles","different flow rates","breathing minute volumes","Respiratory protection","compromises protection","scanning mobility particle sizer","sealed condition","NaCl aerosol similar","electrical mobility diameter","method","SMs","surgical mask","MPPS","data","Results","issue","manikin"],"language":"en"},

Although it shows a high mortality rate in humans, currently there is no licensed therapeutic. During the recent epidemic in West Africa, it was demonstrated that administration of antimalarial medication containing amodiaquine significantly lowered mortality rate of patients infected with the virus. Here, in order to improve its antiviral activity, a series of amodiaquine derivatives were synthesized and tested for Ebola virus infection. We found that multiple compounds were more potent than amodiaquine. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the two independent parts, which are the alkyl chains extending from the aminomethyl group and a halogen bonded to the quinoline ring, were keys for enhancing antiviral potency without increasing toxicity. When these modifications were combined, the antiviral efficacy could be further improved with the selectivity indexes being over 10-times higher than amodiaquine. Mechanistic evaluation demonstrated that the potent derivatives blocked host cell entry of Ebola virus, like the parental amodiaquine. Taken together, our work identified novel potent amodiaquine derivatives, which will aid in further development of effective antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakurai, Yasuteru; Sakakibara, Norikazu; Toyama, Masaaki; Baba, Masanori; Davey, Robert A.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4030750a9cd52eaeee7ffe919731f982021f0af6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218305357; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218305357; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["parental amodiaquine","series of amodiaquine derivatives","novel potent amodiaquine derivatives","antiviral activity","Ebola virus infection","Abstract Ebola virus disease","antiviral potency","antiviral efficacy","potent derivatives blocked host cell entry of Ebola virus","development of effective antiviral therapeutics","mortality rate of patients","high mortality rate","severe disease","structure-activity relationship analysis","alkyl chains","administration of antimalarial medication","halogen","aminomethyl group","independent parts","keys","humans","work","West Africa","quinoline ring","times higher","Mechanistic evaluation","recent epidemic","pathogenic Ebolaviruses","multiple compounds","selectivity indexes","modifications","toxicity","order"],"language":"en"},

At present, only insufficient information is available on currently circulating PEDV strains in Europe and their impact on the European swine industry. In this case report, we present epidemic outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in three farms in South-Western Germany. CASE PRESENTATION: Epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea affecting pigs of all age groups were reported in three farms, one fattening farm and two piglet producing farms, in South-Western Germany between May and November 2014. In the fattening farm yellowish, watery diarrhea without evidence of mucus or blood was associated with a massive reduction of feed consumption. Severity of clinical signs and mortality in young suckling pigs varied significantly between the two affected sow farms. While mortality in suckling piglets reached almost 70 % in one sow herd, no increase in suckling piglet mortality was observed in the second sow farm. In all three cases, PEDV was confirmed in feces and small intestines by RT-qPCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on full-length PEDV genomes revealed high identity among strains from all three herds. Moreover, the German strains showed very high nucleotide identity (99.4 %) with a variant of PEDV (OH851) that was isolated in the United States in January 2014. This strain with insertions and deletions in the S-gene (so called INDEL strains) was reported to show lower virulence. Slightly lower identities were found with other strains from the US and Asia. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic information on the distribution of PEDV strains in Europe is severely lacking. In this case report we demonstrate that acute outbreaks of PEDV occurred in southern Germany in 2014. Current strains were clearly different from isolates found in the 1980s and were closely related to a PEDV variant found in the US in 2014. Moreover, the present case report indicates that variant strains of PEDV, containing insertions and deletions in the S gene, which were reported to be of lower virulence, might be able to cause high mortality in suckling piglets.","publish_time":"2015-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stadler, Julia; Zoels, Susanne; Fux, Robert; Hanke, Dennis; Pohlmann, Anne; Blome, Sandra; Weissenb\u00F6ck, Herbert; Weissenbacher-Lang, Christiane; Ritzmann, Mathias; Ladinig, Andrea","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5688011525aeb581afabe204b64d4da24257aff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4487554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0454-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26135732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Europe","Germany","United States","Asia"],"keyphrases":["variant strains of PEDV","distribution of PEDV strains","variant of PEDV","PEDV variant","acute outbreaks of PEDV","German strains","Current strains","INDEL strains","Epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea","full-length PEDV genomes","epidemic outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea","high mortality","suckling piglet mortality","present case report","suckling piglets","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","affected sow farms","watery diarrhea","high identity","CASE PRESENTATION","South-Western Germany","S-gene","S gene","lower virulence","young suckling pigs","high nucleotide identity","insertions","Phylogenetic information","deletions","fattening farm yellowish","southern Germany","Asia","sow herd","lower identities","Phylogenetic analyses","insufficient information","impact","blood","feces","evidence of mucus","years","increase","Severity of clinical signs","devastating enteric diseases","small intestines","isolates","countries","age groups","massive reduction of feed consumption","RT-qPCR","European swine industry","CONCLUSION","cases","herds","OH851","United States","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

As phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism involved in most cellular processes, kinases represent a target of choice to identify host factors required for viral replication. A kinase and phosphatase small interfering RNA (siRNA) high-content screening was performed on a fluorescent protein-recombinant field isolate (Tha RABV). We identified 57 high-confidence key host factors important for RABV replication with a readout set at 18 h postinfection and 73 with a readout set at 36 h postinfection, including 24 common factors at all stages of the infection. Amongst them, gene clusters of the most prominent pathways were determined. Up to 15 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and effectors, including MKK7 (associated with Jun N-terminal protein kinase [JNK] signalization) and DUSP5, as well as 17 phosphatidylinositol (PI)-related proteins, including PIP5K1C and MTM1, were found to be involved in the later stage of RABV infection. The importance of these pathways was further validated, as small molecules Ro 31-8820 and PD 198306 inhibited RABV replication in human neurons. IMPORTANCE Rabies virus relies on cellular machinery for its replication while simultaneously evading the host immune response. Despite their importance, little is known about the key host factors required for rabies virus infection. Here, we focused on the human kinome, at the core of many cellular pathways, to unveil a new understanding of the rabies virus infectious cycle and to discover new potential therapeutic targets in a small interfering RNA screening. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol metabolism were identified as prominent factors involved in rabies virus infection, and those findings were further confirmed in human neurons. While bringing a new insight into rabies virus biology, we also provide a new list of host factors involved in rabies virus infection.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Besson, Benoit; Kim, Seonhee; Kim, Taehee; Ko, Yoonae; Lee, Sangchul; Larrous, Florence; Song, Jihwan; Shum, David; Grailhe, Regis; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb04b7111c59c623bd68cf0441f18ccfcddb5b40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6531879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118297/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00047-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RABV","PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rabies virus infection","IMPORTANCE Rabies virus","rabies virus biology","host-virus interactions","rabies virus infectious cycle","new list of host factors","prominent factors","common factors","inhibited RABV replication","host immune response","high-confidence key host factors important","Tha RABV","later stage of RABV infection","cellular pathways","new understanding","mitogen-activated protein kinases","new insight","viral replication","prominent pathways","human neurons","mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway","small interfering RNA screening","N-terminal protein kinase","phosphatase small interfering RNA","cellular processes","cellular machinery","readout","h postinfection","human kinome","new potential therapeutic targets","high-content screening","key regulatory mechanism","small molecules Ro","fluorescent protein-recombinant field isolate","phosphatidylinositol metabolism","siRNA","JNK","MAPKs","PD","related proteins","signalization","target of choice","findings","effectors","core","capacity","PIP5K1C","MTM1","MKK7","DUSP5","phosphorylation","gene clusters","stages"],"language":"en"},

A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. Setting: The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Participants: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. Interventions: TCZ was administered to 21 patients. The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. Results: There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years). Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin). No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration. This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC. Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels.

METHODS: From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 182 adult patients presented with symptoms of ARI and admitted to the hospital were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were collected by retrospective analysis of the patient\u0027s chart. RESULTS: A virus was identified in 106 (58.5%) of the patients. The most commonly detected virus was influenza virus (41.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (13.8%), human metapneumovirus (13.0%), parainfluenza viruses (12.2%), rhinoviruses (11.4%), adenovirus and coronaviruses with equal frequencies (3.3%), and enterovirus (1.6%).

This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013\u20132016 outbreak and rose to high frequency.

Tetracyclines were found to be highly effective against various pathogens including rickettsiae, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, thus becoming the first class of broad spectrum antibiotics. Many other interesting properties, unrelated to their antibiotic activity, have been identified for tetracyclines which have led to widely divergent experimental and clinical uses. For example, tetracyclines are also an effective anti-malarial drug. Minocycline, which can readily cross cell membranes, is known to be a potent anti-apoptotic agent. Another tetracycline, doxycycline is known to exert anti-protease activities. Doxycycline can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases which contribute to tissue destruction activities in diseases such as periodontitis. A large body of literature has provided additional evidence for the \u201Cbeneficial\u201D actions of tetracyclines, including their ability to act as reactive oxygen species scavengers and anti-inflammatory agents.

Insufficient information about viral activity increases the difficulty of forecasting the disease burden and thus hampers official preparation efforts. Here we identified potential meteorological factors that drove the seasonal variations in influenza infections in a subtropical city, Hong Kong. We fitted the meteorological data and influenza mortality data from 2002 to 2009 in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model. From the results, air temperature was a common significant driver of seasonal patterns and cold temperature was associated with an increase in transmission intensity for most of the influenza epidemics. Except 2004, the fitted models with significant meteorological factors could account for more than 10% of the variance in additional to the null model.

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm(3)) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as \u201Cspeech superemitters,\u201D consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asadi, Sima; Wexler, Anthony S.; Cappa, Christopher D.; Barreda, Santiago; Bouvier, Nicole M.; Ristenpart, William D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11dcdcd827d9e2a609a7396a335d6c9891d99c28.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8954feaa230060999c4f698c1582ffadfd79b0b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6382806.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38808-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30787335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal speech","large quantities of particles","speech superemitters","normal human speech","airborne infectious disease transmission","phenomenon of speech superemission","outbreaks of airborne infectious disease","probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission","small fraction of individuals","eye","variety of communicable respiratory pathogens","visible droplets","sneezing","Mechanistic hypotheses","rate of particle emission","dramatic expiratory events","Spanish","language","unknown physiological factors","role of coughing","high amplitudes","Mandarin","English","results","order of magnitude","loudness","existence of superspreaders","phonic structures","Arabic","vocalization","data","peers","second"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to analyse early and late pathological responses in the respiratory tract after infection with the European PRRSV subtype 3 strain Lena in comparison to two European PRRSV subtype 1 strains: Belgium A and Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). For each virus strain, groups of twelve pigs were inoculated, and four pigs per group were euthanized at days 3, 7 and 35 post-infection (p.i.) for consecutive examination. Infection with strain Lena resulted in a more severe disease than with the subtype 1 strains, an inflammatory response within the first week of infection with expression of IL-1\u03B1 in the lung and lymph node, and an influx of neutrophils and monocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Infection with strain Belgium A or LV resulted in mild or no pathology within the first week of infection, but inflammatory cell influx in the lung interstititium was increased at the end of the experiment at day 35 p.i. At five weeks p.i., all strains induced a higher percentage of cytotoxic T cells and higher levels of IFN-\u03B3 producing cells in BALF. This might have contributed to clearance of virus. In general, subtype 3 strain Lena induced a stronger early inflammatory response which led to more severe clinical disease and pathology. On the other hand, this may have supported an enhanced or faster clearance of virus in tissues, compared to subtype 1 strains.","publish_time":"2014-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weesendorp, Eefke; Rebel, Johanna M.J.; Popma-De Graaf, Ditta J.; Fijten, Helmi P.D.; Stockhofe-Zurwieden, Norbert","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/138545124afef6e411580b5d4583ea75519ac629.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117439.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514004337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25301281/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514004337; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.09.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lena"],"organizations":["European PRRSV","BALF","LV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus strain","strain Lena","week of infection","strain Belgium","post-infection","European PRRSV subtype","PRRS virus","faster clearance of virus","emergence of virulent strains","inflammatory cell influx","stronger early inflammatory response","severe disease","BALF","pigs","pathology","severe clinical disease","respiratory tract","respiratory syndrome","influx of neutrophils","lung interstititium","higher percentage of cytotoxic T cells","higher levels of IFN","comparison","monocytes","late pathological responses","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","tissues","high mutation rate","lymph node","expression of IL","Lelystad-Ter Huurne","end","days","study","groups","consecutive examination","experiment","weeks","objective","hand"],"language":"en"},

To explain and predict behavioural patterns, the article takes into account the following moderating variables: the kind of affectedness, mode of regional and interregional cooperation, the degree of institutionalisation and the role of international actors. The independent variable is the crisis itself. It replaces goal formulation for action and interaction during periods of normalcy. The succeeding paragraphs argue that a transnational crisis may trigger integrative dynamics and institutional change, but, that the mode of regional and interregional cooperation and the degree of institutionalisation matter in the long run and are the essential factors in differentiating the cooperative dynamics. These two variables are vital elements contributing to the institutional design of a regional organisation. In the end, the article views the institutional design to be the central and constant determinant of integrative behaviour both in times of and in absence of crises.","publish_time":"2011-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maier-Knapp, Naila","journal":"Asia Eur J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d341af92468985313c2c6b709717cc15a4573c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104606.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10308-011-0289-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Association of Southeast Asian Nation"],"locations":["European Union","East Asia"],"keyphrases":["mode of regional","interregional integrative dynamics","article","behaviour of regional organisations","interregional cooperation","institutional design","cooperative dynamics","institutional change","Association of Southeast Asian Nation\u2019s regional","constant determinant of integrative behaviour","degree of institutionalisation matter","following moderating variables","transnational crisis","response","avian influenza outbreak","kind of affectedness","long run","interaction","essential factors","times","account","European Union\u2019s","institutionalist perspective","vital elements","goal formulation","periods of normalcy","role of international actors","collaborative efforts","years","succeeding paragraphs","behavioural patterns","absence of crises","independent variable"],"language":"en"},

Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor. Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection. Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV. Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response. A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids. Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Josset, Laurence; Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Sova, Pavel; Carter, Victoria S.; Yount, Boyd L.; Graham, Rachel L.; Baric, Ralph S.; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4edda548e89522b4df20e723e29c63f309857b10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3663187.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00165-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23631916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MHC"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-EMC","SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","CoV family","distinct host responses","host transcriptome","distinct host gene expression responses","adaptive host response","viruses","novel human coronavirus","important impact","antigen presentation pathway","similar activation of pattern recognition receptors","human lung epithelial cell line","causative agent","potential antiviral compounds","severe acute respiratory syndrome","minimal transcriptomic changes","kinase inhibitors","cells","massive dysregulation","illness","greater extent","therapeutic strategies","h postinfection","interleukin","computational screen","major histocompatibility complex","MHC","emergent virus","Middle East","glucocorticoids","pathogenesis","ability","Calu","unique set"],"language":"en"},

Pathogen\u2010reduction technologies have been successfully implemented by plasma fractionators resulting in no transmission of human immunodeficiency, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B viruses by US\u2010licensed plasma derivatives since 1987. Fractionation technologies cannot be used to treat cellular blood components. Although blood donor screening, deferral and disease testing have drastically reduced the incidence of transfusion\u2010transmitted diseases, the threat of new or re\u2010emerging pathogens remains. Of particular concern is the silent emergence of a new agent with a prolonged latent period in which asymptomatic infected carriers would donate and spread infection. The ultimate goal of pathogen\u2010inactivation is to reduce transmission of potential pathogens without significantly compromising the therapeutic efficacy of the cellular and protein constituents of blood.

Animal models are useful in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis. Because of various limitations in current laboratory animal models, it is essential to develop new alternative animal models for influenza virus research aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human. METHOD: We investigated the replicative efficiency of influenza H1N1 virus (classic strain (Influenza A/PR/8/34), seasonal influenza isolate (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/02/09) and swine-origin human influenza virus (A/Guangzhou/GIRD/07/09)) at Day1,2,4,6 and 9 p.i. using TCID(50) and qPCR assay in tree shrew model. Body temperature was monitored in the morning and evening for 3 days before infection and for 14 days. Seroconversion was detected by determining the neutralizing antibody titers against the challenge viruses in the pre- and exposure serum samples collected before infection and at 14 days p.i., respectively. Lungs and tracheas of tree shews were collected at day 14 post p.i. for histopathological analysis. Lectinhistochemistry analysis was conducted to identify the distribution of SA\u03B12,3 Gal and SA\u03B12,6 Gal receptors in the lung and trachea. RESULTS: The infected tree shrew displayed mild or moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms and pathological changes in respiratory tracts. The human H1N1 influenza virus may replicate in the upper respiratory tract of tree shrews. Analysis of the receptors distribution in the respiratory tract of tree shrews by lectinhistochemistry showed that sialic acid (SA)\u03B12,6-Gal receptors were widely distributed in the trachea and nasal mucosa, whereas (SA)\u03B12,3-Gal receptor was the main receptor in the lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, tree shrew seemed to mimic well influenza virus infection in humans. We propose that tree shrews could be a useful alternative mammalian model to study pathogenesis of influenza H1N1 virus.","publish_time":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Zi-feng; Zhao, Jin; Zhu, Yu-tong; Wang, Yu-tao; Liu, Rong; Zhao, Sui-shan; Li, Run-feng; Yang, Chun-guang; Li, Ji-qiang; Zhong, Nan-shan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa07cb83c9ec268f4be524c374659bc3584fca6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3639867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23575279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","influenza virus research","human H1N1 influenza virus","study of influenza virus pathogenesis","influenza pandemics","study pathogenesis of influenza H1N1 virus","replicative efficiency of influenza H1N1 virus","swine-origin human influenza virus","seasonal influenza isolate","tree shrew model","tracheas of tree","infected tree shrew","Gal receptors","upper respiratory tract of tree shrews","days","respiratory symptoms","respiratory tracts","receptors distribution","Lectinhistochemistry analysis","new alternative animal models","current laboratory animal models","Guangzhou","distribution of SA\u03B12","GIRD","histopathological analysis","useful alternative mammalian model","main receptor","lung tissue","challenge viruses","pathological changes","classic strain","sialic acid","exposure serum samples","various limitations","qPCR assay","PR","neutralizing antibody titers","morning","significant morbidity","host factors","nasal mucosa","post","evening","findings","RESULTS","humans","Body temperature","mortality","TCID","METHOD","Lungs","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Seroconversion","Day1"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein we demonstrate how the knowledge space of infectious diseases can be computationally represented and quantified, and tracked over time. The knowledge space is explored by mapping of the infectious disease literature, looking at dynamics of literature deposition, zooming in from pathogen to genome level and searching for new associations. Syndromic signatures for different pathogens can be created to enable a new and clinically focussed reclassification of the microbial world. Examples of syndrome and pathogen networks illustrate how multilevel network representations of the relationships between infectious syndromes, pathogens and pathogen genomes can illuminate unexpected biological similarities in disease pathogenesis and epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new approach based on text and data mining can support the discovery of previously hidden associations between diseases and microbial pathogens, clinically relevant reclassification of pathogenic microorganisms and accelerate the translational research enterprise.","publish_time":"2010-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sintchenko, Vitali; Anthony, Stephen; Phan, Xuan-Hieu; Lin, Frank; Coiera, Enrico W.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bda762e027453e4c025cbc73b0ceef6f3d17f45f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2835740.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20224767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious syndromes","infectious disease syndromes","infectious disease literature","microbial pathogens","knowledge space of infectious diseases","various infectious agents","different pathogens","new associations","pathogen genomes","pathogen networks","disease pathogenesis","microbial genome databases","dynamics of relationships","microbial world","new approach","dynamics of literature deposition","processes of knowledge synthesis","based publications","genome level","focussed reclassification","hidden associations","Computational discovery","online repositories of text","relevant reclassification of pathogenic microorganisms","unexpected biological similarities","multilevel network representations","order","PubMed database","mapping","data mining","attempt","epidemiology","translational research enterprise","Examples of syndrome","greater role","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","Syndromic signatures","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","manuscripts","BACKGROUND","significant proportion","time","study"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffer, developed for membrane hybridization, could be used to decrease hybridization time for ISH. Tissue from swine with an enteric disease produced by a swine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was used as a model to standardize hybridization conditions for a rapid ISH technique. Small intestinal sections from pigs experimentally and naturally infected with TGEV were hybridized for various times at 52\u00B0C and 70\u00B0C with a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe in a standard hybridization or a REH buffer. Viral RNA was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe; however, the signal was stronger with the REH buffer. With the fluorescein-labelled probe, viral RNA was detected in virus-infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the REH buffer. Signal intensity was greater with the REH buffer than with the standard hybridization buffer when compared at each hybridization time and hybridization temperature using both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes. With the REH buffer, hybridization signal intensity was greater at 70\u00B0C than at 52\u00B0C for both probes. The best results were obtained when small intestinal sections were hybridized at 70\u00B0C for 2 h using a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled probe diluted in the REH buffer. The fluorescein-labelled RNA probe with REH buffer resulted in a minimal non-specific signal when compared with the radiolabelled probe.

They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. METHODS: By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. RESULTS: It was found that the clustered incidence of children\u0027s families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. CONCLUSION: There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China\u0027s experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhen-Dong, Yang; Gao-Jun, Zhou; Run-Ming, Jin; Zhi-Sheng, Liu; Zong-Qi, Dong; Xiong, Xie; Guo-Wei, Song","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73ea7164a763613fe768df2764a50636cffe508c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187854.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302413; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302413?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["control of COVID","faster recovery of sick children","adults","clinical features of COVID","control experience of Chinese pediatricians","asymptomatic infections","epidemic prevention","first-hand clinical data","virus nucleic acid","cases of critical illness","mild cases account","clustered incidence of children\u0027s families","China\u0027s experience","digestive tract nucleic acid tests","dynamic transmission feature","hidden source of transmission","difficulties","milder conditions","laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts","recognition","kindergartens","anal swab","early identification","pediatric fever clinic","treatment of coronavirus disease","analysis","chest CT findings","large sample","schools","English literature","concealed morbidity characteristics","accounting","better prognosis","screening","presentations","stool samples","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","line","world","CONCLUSION","Efforts","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, it is likely that this emergency will not disappear soon. No health system, with its present resources and work flow is ready to deal with a full-blown wave of this pandemic. Rapid acquisition of specific new skills may be fundamental in delivering appropriate health care for our patients. COVID-19 infection is classically diagnosed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and radiological investigations (X-ray or high-resolution computerized tomography). These techniques are not without limitations. Ultrasound has been suggested as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing the lungs in patients with suspected pneumonia. Obstetricians and gynecologists are usually familiar with the use of ultrasound. Lung ultrasound can show specific signs of interstitial pneumonia, which is characteristic of COVID-19 pulmonary infection. We believe that extensive and rapid training of healthcare providers on the application of ultrasound in the detection of characteristic pulmonary signs of COVID-19 infection, in addition to proper care and handling of their ultrasound machines, is feasible and may be critical in order to provide appropriate management especially of the obstetric patient in the coming period. We present a systematic approach to lung examination, simplified to encourage its adoption by obstetricians and gynecologists, together with an example of a recent pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection, in which lung ultrasound was useful in the management.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Youssef, Aly; Serra, Carla; Pilu, Gianluigi","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10afaad43ddf5ea999f923f8826e18f7cfe8a6c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305391?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305391; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lung ultrasound","characteristic of COVID","application of ultrasound","ultrasound machines","use of ultrasound","pulmonary infection","current COVID","health system","detection of characteristic pulmonary signs of COVID","appropriate health care","appropriate management","patients","lung examination","gynecologists","pandemic","Obstetricians","specific signs of interstitial pneumonia","proper care","present resources","suspected pneumonia","Rapid acquisition of specific new skills","rapid training of healthcare providers","radiological investigations","real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","X-ray","lungs","obstetric patient","handling","addition","high-resolution computerized tomography","recent pregnant woman","example","work flow","order","challenge","accurate tool","coming period","full-blown wave","systematic approach","adoption","globe","techniques","limitations","emergency"],"language":"en"},

We performed a cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) on preventive measures of Influenza A (H1N1) involving 322 patients attending Klinik Kesihatan Jinjang, a primary health care clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from May 10 to 26, 2010 using a face to face interview with a structured pre-tested questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were females (56.8%), Malays (43.2%) aged between 18-27 years old (28.9%). There were significant association between knowledge on the complication of H1N1, effectiveness of the treatment, preventive measures of Influenza A (H1N1) and race (p\u003C0.001) and educational level (p\u003C0.001). There were also significant associations between attitude scores of these patients and their gender (p=0.03), and educational level (p=0.001).

In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Global Disease Detection [GDD] program began collaborating with China to enhance China\u2019s risk communication capacity to address gaps in the SARS communication response. This article describes tangible improvements in China\u2019s public health emergency risk communication capacity between the SARS and H7N9 outbreaks; documents U.S. CDC GDD cooperative technical assistance during 2006\u20132017; and shares lessons learnt to benefit other countries and contribute to enhance global health security. METHOD: A questionnaire based on the WHO Joint External Evaluation tool [Risk Communication section] was developed. A key communications official from the China National Health Commission [NHC] completed the questionnaire retrospectively to reflect China\u2019s capacity to manage communication response before, during and after the outbreaks of SARS in 2003, influenza H1N1 in 2009, and influenza H7N9 in 2013. A literature search was also conducted in English and Chinese to further substantiate the results of the questionnaire completed by NHC. RESULTS: China demonstrated significantly improved risk communication capacities of pre-event, during event and post event responses to H7N9 when compared to the SARS response. China NHC improved its response through preparedness, availability of dedicated staff and resources for risk communication, internal clearance mechanisms, standard operating procedures with national response parties external to NHC, rumor management, communication with international agencies and consistent messaging with healthcare and private sectors. Correspondingly, the perceived level of trust that the public had in the NHC following outbreaks rose between the SARS and H7N9 response. CONCLUSION: Risk communication capacities in China have increased during the ten years between the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H7N9 outbreak of 2013. Long-term risk communication capacity building efforts in bilateral collaborations are uncommon. The U.S. CDC GDD project was one of the first such collaborations worldwide. The lessons learned from this project may benefit lower and middle-income countries as they build their national emergency risk communication capacity.

LF is typically mild but it can cause severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever and multi-organ failure. A current outbreak of LASV in Nigeria has seen greater than 300 cases with a case fatality rate of 22%. Currently, there are limited treatment options and no vaccine candidates are approved to prevent LASV infection. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has identified LASV as an emerging pathogen of high consequence and this has resulted in a push for several preclinical vaccine candidates to be advanced toward clinical trials. Here, we discuss several important aspects of LASV infection including immunobiology, immune evasion, and correlates of protection against LF, which have been identified through animal models and human infections. In addition, we discuss several vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in animal models that could be advanced toward clinical trials. The increased fatality rate seen in the recent LASV outbreak in Nigeria highlights the importance of developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against LF. The spike in LASV cases seen in West Africa has the potential for increased mortality and human-to-human transmission, making the development and testing of effective vaccines for LASV critical.","publish_time":"2018-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warner, Bryce M; Safronetz, David; Stein, Derek R","journal":"Drug Des Devel Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34dbc74805291ff544a0944fd54d1e4f1a470080.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6097522.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30147299/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s147276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LASV"],"locations":["West Africa","Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["LASV cases","LASV critical","LF","recent LASV outbreak","current outbreak of LASV","important aspects of LASV infection","preclinical vaccine candidates","effective treatment","Nigeria","Lassa fever","human transmission","increased fatality rate","human infections","animal models","clinical trials","case fatality rate","hemorrhagic fever","increased mortality","Lassa virus","West African countries","testing of effective vaccines","limited treatment options","immunobiology","immune evasion","importance","arenavirus endemic","development","potential","severe disease","correlates of protection","prevention strategies","multi-organ failure","Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","emerging pathogen of high consequence","rodent","efficacy","Coalition","push","spike","addition"],"language":"en"},

While filoviruses infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are refractory to EBOV infection. This could be explained by a single amino acid change in the filovirus receptor, NPC1, which greatly reduces the affinity of EBOV-NPC1 interaction. We found signatures of positive selection in bat NPC1 concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon helvum cells. Our work identifies NPC1 as a genetic determinant of filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some NPC1 variations reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence. A single viral mutation afforded escape from receptor control, revealing a pathway for compensatory viral evolution and a potential avenue for expansion of filovirus host range in nature.

Swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 15 respiratory viruses and subtypes. Results. At least 1 virus was detected in 382 (84%) of 455 new-onset illnesses with multiple viruses identified in 212 (46%). The proportion of subject swabs with multiple viruses detected changed as respiratory illnesses progressed from week to week, as did the prevalence of individual viruses. Children with multiple viruses detected at the time of illness onset had less frequent fever (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35, 0.90), however, these children more often had illness symptoms lasting over 7 days (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.20, 3.14).

The virus utilized a protein of the carcinoembryonic antigen family as its receptor. In contrast to TGEV, MHV-A59 was released preferentially from the basolateral plasma membrane domain, as evidenced by the accumulation of viral proteins and infectivity in the basolateral culture fluid as well as by electron microscopical observations in the mouse, MHV initially replicates in the nasal epithelium before being disseminated throughout the body; the basolateral release of MHV from epithelial cells into the animal\u0027s circulation may be the first step in the establishment of a systemic infection.","publish_time":"1995-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossen, J.W.A.; Voorhout, W.

Among active-duty and other Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries, EIDAR research is largely focused on evaluating the incidence, risk factors, and acute- and long-term health effects of military-relevant EIDs, especially those caused by high-consequence pathogens or are responsible for outbreaks among US military populations. The EIDAR efforts also address Force Health Protection concerns associated with antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship practices within the MHS. METHODS: The EIDAR studies utilize the approach of: (1) Preparing for emergent conditions to systematically collect clinical specimens and data and conduct clinical trials to assist the military with a scientifically appropriate response; and (2) Evaluating burden of emergent military-relevant infectious diseases and assessing risks for exposure and development of post-infectious complications and overall impact on military readiness. RESULTS: In response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, the IDCRP partnered with the National Institutes of Health in developing a multicenter, randomized safety and efficacy study of investigational therapeutics in Ebola patients. Subsequently, the EIDAR team developed a protocol to serve as a contingency plan (EpICC-EID) to allow clinical research activities to occur during future outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory infections among MHS patients. The EIDAR portfolio recently expanded to include studies to understand exposure risks and impact on military readiness for a diversity of EIDs, such as seroincidence of non-Lyme disease borreliosis and Coccidioides fungal infections among high-risk military populations. The team also launched a new prospective study in response to the recent Zika epidemic to conduct surveillance for Zika and other related viruses among MHS beneficiaries in Puerto Rico. Another new study will prospectively follow U.S. Marines via an online health assessment survey to assess long-term health effects following the largest DoD Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli outbreak at the U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot-San Diego. In cooperation with the Trauma-Related Infections Research Area, the EIDAR Research Area is also involved with the Multidrug-Resistant and Virulent Organisms Trauma Infections Initiative, which is a collaborative effort across DoD laboratories to characterize bacterial and fungal isolates infecting combat-related extremity wounds and link lab findings to clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the EIDAR team has developed an Antimicrobial Resistance and Stewardship Collaborative Clinical Research Consortium, comprised of Infectious Disease and Pharmacy specialists. CONCLUSIONS: The EIDAR Research Area is responsive to military-relevant infectious disease threats that are also frequently global public health concerns. Several new EIDAR efforts are underway that will provide Combatant Command Surgeons, Infectious Diseases Service Chiefs, and other Force Health Protection stakeholders with epidemiological information to mitigate the impact of EIDs and antimicrobial resistance on the health of U.S. military service members and their dependents.","publish_time":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lanteri, Charlotte; Mende, Katrin; Kortepeter, Mark","journal":"Mil Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/934e35d624b2fbdb349084551b7e00e0d58b0021.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6802279.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program","DoD","MHS","Force Health Protection","National Institutes of Health","U.S. Marines","DoD Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia","U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot-San Diego","Trauma-Related Infections Research Area","EIDAR Research Area","Virulent Organisms Trauma Infections Initiative","Antimicrobial Resistance","Combatant Command Surgeons, Infectious Diseases Service Chiefs"],"locations":["West Africa","Puerto Rico","U.S."],"keyphrases":["health of","EIDAR Research Area","Military Health System","EIDAR team","Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program\u2019s","long-term health effects of military","EIDAR studies","military-relevant infectious disease threats","clinical research capability","clinical research activities","EIDAR portfolio","US military readiness","US military populations","new EIDAR efforts","burden of emergent military-relevant infectious diseases","military service members","high-risk military populations","Antimicrobial Resistance","Trauma-Related Infections Research Area","Stewardship Collaborative Clinical Research Consortium","clinical specimens","clinical outcomes","clinical trials","Force Health Protection concerns","National Institutes of Health","Infectious Diseases Service Chiefs","Force Health Protection stakeholders","global public health concerns","online health assessment survey","impact of EIDs","relevant EIDs","MHS beneficiaries","MHS patients","new study","development of post-infectious complications","antimicrobial stewardship practices","Coccidioides fungal infections","new prospective study","severe acute respiratory infections","related viruses","IDCRP","DoD laboratories","overall impact","exposure risks","Ebola patients","diversity of EIDs","appropriate response","Virulent Organisms Trauma Infections Initiative","seroincidence of non-Lyme disease borreliosis","recent Zika epidemic","Ebola virus epidemic","fungal isolates","combat-related extremity wounds","largest DoD Shiga Toxin","efficacy study of investigational therapeutics","EpICC-EID","collaborative effort","emergent conditions","future outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever","link lab findings","Escherichia coli outbreak","Combatant Command Surgeons","epidemiological information","Marine Corps Recruit Depot-San Diego","Department of Defense","randomized safety","surveillance","Marines","Multidrug-Resistant","West Africa","Puerto Rico","contingency plan","high-consequence pathogens","protocol","data","INTRODUCTION","risk factors","active-duty","dependents","cooperation","Pharmacy specialists","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","approach"],"language":"en"},

Studies carried out with experimental infections report that at least in certain conditions, this infection may spread to the lower respiratory tract as the virus acts on the respiratory epithelium. In vitro experiments with cells from the immune system and lower respiratory tract suggest that the mechanisms of action are directly linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence shows that rhinoviruses may stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines. They may also stimulate the cholinergic and non-cholinergic nervous system, increasing the production of ICAM-1 and may give rise to a T-lymphocyte non-specific response or to T-lymphocyte replication in direct relation with viral infection. In addition, greater production of cysteinyl leukotrienes has been observed in the secretions of patients with bronchospasm Experimental infection with Rhinovirus increases clinical symptomatology and bronchial hyperreactivity. The latter is associated with increased eosinophils and cationic proteins in sputum The above findings suggest that multiple cellular pathways are involved in the induction of exacerbations of asthma induced by the virus.

Since 2003 MBDS has pioneered a unique model for local cross-border cooperation. This study examines stakeholders\u2019 perspectives of these MBDS experiences, based on a survey of local managers and semi-structured interviews with MBDS leaders and the central coordinator. RESULTS: Fifteen managers from 12 of 20 paired cross-border sites completed a written survey. They all monitor most or all of the 17 diseases agreed upon for MBDS surveillance information sharing. Fourteen agreed or strongly agreed with statements about the core MBDS values of cooperation, mutual trust, and transparency, and their own contributions to national and regional disease control (average score of 4.4 of 5.0). Respondents felt they implemented well to very well activities related to surveillance reporting (average scores 3.4 to 3.9 of 4.0), using computers for their work (3.9/4.0), and using surveillance data for action (3.8/4.0). Respondents reported that they did worst in implementing research (2.1/4.0) and somewhat poorly for local laboratory testing (2.9/4.0) and local coordination with cross-border counterparts (2.9/4.0), although all 15 maintain a list with contact information for these counterparts and many know their counterparts. Implementation of specified activities within their collective regional action plan was uneven across the cross-border sites. Most respondents reported positive lessons learned about local cooperation, information sharing and joint problem solving, based on trusting relationships with their cross-border counterparts. They recommend expansion of cross-border sites within MBDS and consideration of the cross-border cooperation model by other sub-regional networks. CONCLUSIONS: MBDS has over a decade of experience with its model of local cross-border cooperation in disease surveillance and control. Frontline managers have documented success with this model, strongly support it and recommend its expansion within and beyond the MBDS network. The MBDS cross-border cooperation model is standing the test of time as a solid approach to building and sustaining the public health capabilities needed for disease surveillance and control from the local to national and global levels.

The fact that the regions of sequence for primer hybridization in the described method have remained sufficiently conserved since the AMPV and HMPV diverged, should give the best chance of continued detection of current subgroups and of potential unknown or future emerging MPV strains.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemaitre, E.; All\u00E9e, C.; Vabret, A.; Eterradossi, N.; Brown, PA.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26bca70200beba798f52a32b42dac01ad160ab8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341730558X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.10.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341730558X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NF","HMPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AMPV subgroups","specific subgroups","detection of avian","detection levels","individual subgroups","best chance of continued detection of current subgroups","real time RT-PCRs","low limits of detection","HMPV","described method","conserved fragment of sequence","Abstract Current molecular methods","regions of sequence","design of durable molecular diagnostic test","broad range SYBR Green","future emerging MPV strains","rate of change","challenge","primer hybridization","human metapneumovirus","N open reading frame","\u03BCL","norm","copies","genome sequences","NF U47","virus species","RNA viruses","different areas","validation","MPVs","fact"],"language":"en"},

The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity among nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous and rationale lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of extensive rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here can be updated and revised novel S1 sequences should become available.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valastro, Viviana; Holmes, Edward C.; Britton, Paul; Fusaro, Alice; Jackwood, Mark W.; Cattoli, Giovanni; Monne, Isabella","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ce753b839a8001030d5f70cb9d6e5e2099df01c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172980.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816300466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883378/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816300466; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.02.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV sequences","phylogenetic structure of IBV","assignment of IBV strains","viral nomenclature","phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic history","sequence classification","complete nucleotide sequences","future studies of IBV epidemiology","distinct viral types","distinct viral lineages","revised novel S1 sequences","inference of phylogenetic relationships","amino acid sequences","classification scheme","rationale lineage nomenclature","S1 gene","repeatable phylogeny-based classification system","Infectious bronchitis virus","number of inter-lineage recombinants","similarity","severe economic losses","evolution","contagious disease","heterogeneous genetic group designations","wide variety","global poultry industry","causative agent","appropriate criterion","IBVs","confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes","measures","extensive rate variation","turn","genotypes","method","consensus","comparisons","adoption"],"language":"en"},

Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather can possibly slowdown the global pandemic, which has already affected over 1.6 million people worldwide. Clarification of such relationships in the worst affected country, the US, can be immensely beneficial to understand the role of weather in transmission of the disease in the highly populated countries, such as India. We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1\u2013Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)). Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range. We validated the results for 10-day intervals against monthly observations, and also worldwide trends. The results were used to predict Indian regions which would be vulnerable to weather based spread in upcoming months of 2020. COVID-19 spread in the US is significant for states with 4 \u003C AH \u003C 6 g/m3 and number of new cases \u003E 10,000, irrespective of the chosen time intervals for study parameters. These trends are consistent with worldwide observations, but do not correlate well with India so far possibly due the total cases reported per interval \u003C 10,000. The results clarify the relationship between weather parameters and COVID-19 spread. The vulnerable weather parameters will help classify the risky geographic areas in different countries. Specifically, with further reporting of new cases in India, prediction of states with high risk of weather based spread will be apparent.","publish_time":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Sonal; Raghuwanshi, Gourav Singh; Chanda, Arnab","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d84a4552bee07108037ab11eea9f3671c7980ac9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138860; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334160/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323779","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["spread","vulnerable weather parameters","warm weather","role of weather","effect of weather","high risk of weather","number of new cases","reporting of new cases","corresponding weather information","US states","total cases","COVID","results","Distribution modeling of new cases","daily data of new cases","vulnerable AH range","worldwide observations","worldwide trends","prediction of states","study parameters","monthly observations","day intervals","different countries","populated countries","chosen time intervals","worst affected country","temperature","risky geographic areas","m3","relationships","slowdown","absolute humidity","disease","global pandemic","Indian regions","upcoming months","transmission","Clarification","studies","people"],"language":"en"},

Production of antimicrobial compounds targeting intestinal pathogens, general immune stimulation, and colonization resistance are among these mechanisms.

The obtained compounds have also been subjected to antiviral screening against a panel of (\u002B)ssRNA viruses.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u0160\u00E1la, Michal; K\u00F6gler, Martin; Pla\u010Dkov\u00E1, Pavla; Mejdrov\u00E1, Ivana; H\u0159ebabeck\u00FD, Hubert; Proch\u00E1zkov\u00E1, Eli\u0161ka; Strunin, Dmytro; Lee, Gary; Birkus, Gabriel; Weber, Jan; Mertl\u00EDkov\u00E1-Kaiserov\u00E1, Helena; Nencka, Radim","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/706b1c8434300a1a41f466587aeba907a8138a17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127540.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X16303638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27090557/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X16303638","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loss of PI4K III\u03B2 inhibitory activity","activity relationship study of novel PI4K III\u03B2 inhibitors","docking study","purine derivative","extensive structure","antiviral screening","purine scaffold","extensive modification","potent screening hit T","interaction","suitable starting point","HEV1","substituted phenyl rings","enzyme","necessary space","remote residues","small substituent","thorough investigation of positions","panel","results","solution","ssRNA viruses","empirical observations","cavity","obtained compounds"],"language":"en"},

The disease, originally termed \u201Catypical pneumonia,\u201D was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of the SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections was most likely originated from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets being considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to have prevented further outbreaks in the region. Further epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV, and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data accumulated indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus\u2013host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter will focus on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Zhengli; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c51d7ba112bd3921570f12d32e0bb50aa74c3a90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149542.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123848901000273; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123848901000273","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","evolution of SARS","intermediate hosts of SARS","events of SARS outbreaks","large number of SARS","likely natural reservoir of SARS","massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data","humans","disease investigation","SL-CoVs","human hosts","masked palm civets","Subsequent investigation","infected wildlife animals","Large-scale culling of civets","bats","human infections","key determinant of interspecies transmission","investigation of unknown viruses","human infection cases","virus susceptibility","key role","dramatic changes","S protein","major zoonotic infectious disease","unrecognized coronavirus","live animal markets","minor changes of amino acid","strong selection pressure","importance of modern molecular epidemiology","different outbreak phases","accompanying response activities","host interaction","residues","screening","urgent need","coronaviruses","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","source","genetics","epidemiological studies","Detailed analysis","deaths","century","spike glycoprotein","Guangdong Province","China","important carrier","months","atypical pneumonia","causative agent","countries","chapter","region"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, HR2 is both the target for novel antiviral therapies and, as an isolated peptide, presents a potential antiviral therapeutic. The structure of HR2, as determined by NMR spectroscopy in the presence of the co-solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE), is a trimer of parallel helices, whereas the structure of HR2, as determined by X-ray crystallography, is a tetramer of anti-parallel helices. In this work, we added a nitroxide spin label to the N-terminal region of HR2 and used paramagnetic relaxation enhancement to assess the orientation of the HR2 helices under different solution conditions. We find that the relaxation effects are consistent with an orientation corresponding to a trimer of parallel helices in both the presence and absence of TFE. This work suggests that the different orientation and oligomerization states observed by NMR and X-ray are due to the 11 additional residues present at the N-terminus of the NMR construct.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Celigoy, Jessica; Ramirez, Benjamin; Caffrey, Michael","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ca32d17a439a70ea3cce23ad878dec54db73320.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3302656.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pro.736; https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21922588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR","TFE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HR2 helices","structure of HR2","trimer of parallel helices","different orientation","N-terminal region of HR2","tetramer of anti-parallel helices","presence","NMR spectroscopy","NMR construct","work","N-terminus","X-ray crystallography","relaxation effects","absence of TFE","paramagnetic relaxation enhancement","novel antiviral therapies","different solution conditions","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","envelope heptad","isolated peptide","oligomerization states","nitroxide spin label","co-solvent trifluoroethanol","additional residues present","critical role","target","viral entry"],"language":"en"},

Fragile health systems can become overwhelmed during public health crises, further exacerbating the human, economic, and political toll. Important work has been done to describe the general attributes of a health system resilient to these crises, and the next step will be to identify the specific capacities that health systems need to develop and maintain to achieve resiliency. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify recurring themes and capacities needed for health system resiliency to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards and any existing implementation frameworks that highlight these capacities. We also sought to identify the overlap of the identified themes and capacities with those highlighted in the World Health Organization\u2019s Joint External Evaluation. Sources of evidence included PubMed, Web of Science, OAIster, and the websites of relevant major public health organizations. RESULTS: We identified 16 themes of health system resilience, including: the need to develop plans for altered standards of care during emergencies, the need to develop plans for post-event recovery, and a commitment to quality improvement. Most of the literature described the general attributes of a resilient health system; no implementation frameworks were identified that could translate these elements into specific capacities that health system actors can employ to improve resilience to outbreaks and natural hazards in a variety of settings. CONCLUSIONS: An implementation-oriented health system resilience framework could help translate the important components of a health system identified in this review into specific capacities that actors in the health system could work to develop to improve resilience to public health crises. However, there remains a need to further refine the concept of resilience so that health systems can simultaneously achieve sustainable transformations in healthcare practice and health service delivery as well as improve their preparedness for emergencies.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nuzzo, Jennifer B.; Meyer, Diane; Snyder, Michael; Ravi, Sanjana J.; Lapascu, Ana; Souleles, Jon; Andrada, Carolina I.; Bishai, David","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3518ccc719fac30ad9a95930985cb000a0018ae5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6798426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623594/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7707-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health system resilient","health system actors","health system resiliency","themes of health system resilience","public health crises","Fragile health systems","health service delivery","implementation-oriented health system resilience framework","critical importance of resilient health systems","specific capacities","websites of relevant major public health organizations","need","World Health Organization\u2019s Joint External Evaluation","identified themes","concept of resilience","natural hazards","existing implementation frameworks","plans","general attributes","recurring themes","literature","emergencies","Important work","scoping review","important components","infectious disease outbreaks","sustainable transformations","healthcare practice","commitment","PubMed","Web of Science","OAIster","post-event recovery","altered standards of care","human","elements","Sources of evidence","wake","political toll","variety of settings","CONCLUSIONS","overlap","Ebola outbreak","quality improvement","preparedness","METHODS","step","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0\u00B0C to 30.1\u00B0C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4\u00B0C to 23.0\u00B0C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byass, Peter","journal":"Global health action","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404043/; https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2020.1760490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","weather data","confirmed cases","overall COVID","outbreak of COVID","grid cells","China","weather conditions","cell population","incident cases","lower incidence","Open-access COVID","case data","summer weather","Weather parameters","clustering of cells","Adjusted incidence rate ratios","maximum solar radiation","cell-week","geo-located cases","minimum daily temperature","single confirmed case","population density","Poisson model","Poisson regression model of cell","Weekly means of maximum daily temperature","weeks","total precipitation","longitude grid","pandemic","rich data source","ecological factors","ecological determinants","appreciable associations","drier conditions","preceding week","Methods","importance","understanding","Results","exposure","day incubation period","MJm","relation","new infection","dependent variable","cause","relevance","effect","Objectives","Conclusion","latitude","epidemic","Background"],"language":"en"},

MHC class I and class II genes encode antigen-presenting molecules expressed on the cell surface. To counteract the high variability of pathogens, the MHC evolved into a region of considerable heterogeneity in its organization, number and extent of polymorphism. Studies of MHCs in different model species contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of immunity, diseases and their evolution. Camels are economically important domestic animals and interesting biomodels. Three species of Old World camels have been recognized: the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and the wild camel (Camelus ferus). Despite their importance, little is known about the MHC genomic region, its organization and diversity in camels. The objectives of this study were to identify, map and characterize the MHC region of Old World camelids, with special attention to genetic variation at selected class MHC II loci. RESULTS: Physical mapping located the MHC region to the chromosome 20 in Camelus dromedarius. Cytogenetic and comparative analyses of whole genome sequences showed that the order of the three major sub-regions is \u201CCentromere - Class II \u2013 Class III \u2013 Class I\u201D. DRA, DRB, DQA and DQB exon 2 sequences encoding the antigen binding site of the corresponding class II antigen presenting molecules showed high degree of sequence similarity and extensive allele sharing across the three species. Unexpectedly low extent of polymorphism with low numbers of alleles and haplotypes was observed in all species, despite different geographic origins of the camels analyzed. The DRA locus was found to be polymorphic, with three alleles shared by all three species. DRA and DQA sequences retrieved from ancient DNA samples of Camelus dromedarius suggested that additional polymorphism might exist. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence that camels possess an MHC comparable to other mammalian species in terms of its genomic localization, organization and sequence similarity. We described ancient variation at the DRA locus, monomorphic in most species. The extent of molecular diversity of MHC class II genes seems to be substantially lower in Old World camels than in other mammalian species.

YmdB, a member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of RNase III activity; however, the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined. YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition. RESULTS: The expression of \u003E2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated, of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly, YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first global profile of target genes modulated by YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in E. coli, and the data reveal a novel, hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for YmdB in biofilm modulation.","publish_time":"2013-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Taeyeon; Lee, Juyeon; Kim, Kwang-sun","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1465b112750748b01edc7837f005803a6e87658.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4222554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YmdB-induced RNase","YmdB overexpression","coli genes","YmdB induction","inhibition","biofilm formation","related genes","hundreds of genes","biofilm inhibitor","biofilm modulation","Escherichia coli","trans-acting regulators of RNase","activity","global profile of target genes","unrecognized regulatory role","specific bacterial cellular processes","gene targets","known stress response regulator","RpoS","microarray analysis","novel","member","significance","macrodomain protein family","data","Ribonuclease","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a reservoir of a virus closely related to SARS CoV and this may be the likely precursor from which the human-adapted SARS CoV emerged. Small mammals such as \u2018civet-cats\u2019 (Paguma larvata) within live animal markets in southern China serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoonotic transmission occurred. The viral spike protein is necessary and sufficient for inducing protective antibody responses and has been a key target in the development of candidate vaccines.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peiris, J.S.M.; Poon, L.L.M.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95ffb882b7eae5dc75b22ac17e1a4de945ecde3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149687.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104007809; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104007809","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS CoV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission of SARS","SARS coronavirus","human transmission","human-adapted SARS CoV","SARS outbreak","respiratory viral infections","virus transmission","new human disease","efficient human","zoonotic transmission","severe viral pneumonia","low viral load","upper respiratory tract","animal coronavirus","viral spike protein","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","presence of underlying respiratory diseases","live animal markets","southern China","likely interface","likely precursor","days of illness","mild liver dysfunction","multiple organ systems","patient isolation","public health measures of case detection","main clinical manifestation","diarrhea","lymphopenia","Paguma larvata","common extra-pulmonary manifestations","key target","civet-cats\u2019","amplifiers of infection","protective antibody responses","stage","community","development of candidate vaccines","prognosis","Small mammals","fortuitous feature","Guangdong Province","Bats","reservoir","months"],"language":"en"},

Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify HRV, and the HRV-positive samples were used for sequencing analysis and to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. HRV was identified in 198 samples (42.2%), and the VP4/VP2 region was successfully amplified in 151 (76.3%). HRV-A was identified in 78 samples (51.6%), HRV-B in 14 (9.3%) and HRV-C in 59 (39.1%). Forty-seven (31.1%) of the children with HRV infection were aged \u003C1 year, 71 (47.0%) were aged 1-3 years, and 33 (21.9%) were aged \u22654 years. Blast and phylogenetic analyses showed that the HRV strains were closely related to a total of 66 reference genotypes, corresponding to 29 HRV-A, 9 HRV-B and 28 HRV-C strains. Nucleotide variability was 37% between HRV-A and HRV-B, 37.3% between HRV-A and HRV-C, and 39.9% between HRV-B and HRV-C. A number of sequences clustered with known serotypes and, within these clusters, there were strains circulating during several seasons. The most frequently detected genotypes were HRV-A78 (n=17), HRV-A12 (n=9) and HRV-C2 (n=5). This study shows that, although it is mainly associated with HRV-A, pediatric CAP can also be diagnosed in subjects infected by HRV-C and, more rarely, by HRV-B. Moreover, a large number of genotypes may be involved in causing pediatric CAP and can be different from year to year. Although the prolonged circulation of the same genotypes can sometimes be associated with a number of CAP episodes in different years.","publish_time":"2013-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daleno, Cristina; Piralla, Antonio; Scala, Alessia; Senatore, Laura; Principi, Nicola; Esposito, Susanna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42446a902145ff6dfa00320a68597ce665006772.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3833952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24260436/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-B","HRV strains","HRV-A78","HRV infection","HRV-A12","HRV-C2","HRV-C strains","HRV-positive samples","pediatric CAP","number of CAP episodes","large number of genotypes","reference genotypes","detected genotypes","different years","Italian children","number of sequences","different human rhinovirus","phylogenetic analyses","phylogenetic tree","prolonged circulation","early spring seasons","species","Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","consecutive winter","RT-PCR","confirmed community","sequencing analysis","known serotypes","pneumonia","hospital","nasopharyngeal swab","clusters","total","subjects","VP4","VP2 region","Blast","Nucleotide variability","order","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods We conducted prospective population-based surveillance in 2 US counties among children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory illness or fever from October 2001 through September 2003. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and tested for HRVs, as determined by means of RT-PCR and then characterized by means of partial sequencing. Results Of 1052 children enrolled and tested during the 2-year period, 167 (16%) had HRVs detected. Of 147 samples successfully sequenced, 64 were group A HRVs, 6 were group B HRVs, and 77 were HRVCs. Children with HRVCs were significantly more likely than those with group A HRVs to have underlying high-risk conditions, such as asthma (42% vs 23%, P = .023) and to have had a discharge diagnosis of asthma (55% vs 36%, P = .022). Conclusions Overall, HRVCs were detected in 7% of children hospitalized for fever or respiratory conditions and constituted almost half of all rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations, suggesting that this novel group causes a substantial burden of pediatric disease.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, E.

In this study, reverse transcription iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) was developed to facilitate point-of-need diagnosis of CDV infection. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection 95%) of the established CDV RT-iiPCR was about 11 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA per reaction. CDV RT-iiPCR generated positive signals from CDV, but not Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus 2, canine influenza virus (subtype H3N8), canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus. To evaluate accuracy of the established reaction in canine distemper clinical diagnosis, 110 specimens from dogs, raccoons, and foxes suspected with CDV infection were tested simultaneously by CDV RT-iiPCR and real-time RT-PCR. CDV RT-iiPCR demonstrated excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), compared to real-time RT-PCR.

The extent to which reduction in growth performance is related to these increased requirements is unclear. To evaluate this relationship, an experiment (2 \u00D7 2 \u00D7 2 factorial arrangement) was performed with 612 male pigs (9 per pen) kept under low sanitary conditions (LSC) or high sanitary conditions (HSC) and offered ad libitum access to either a normal CP concentration diet (NP; 17, 15, and 15% CP for the starter, grower, and finisher phase, respectively) or a low CP concentration diet (LP; 20% CP reduced relative to NP for each phase), each of which containing a basal AA profile (AA-B) or a supplemented AA profile (AA-S). The supplemented diet type contained 20% more Met, Thr, and Trp relative to Lys on an apparent ileal digestible basis compared with the basal diet type. Pigs were followed for a complete fattening period and slaughtered at a targeted pen weight of 110 kg. Haptoglobin concentrations in serum (0.92 g/L for LSC and 0.78 g/L for HSC) and IgG antibody titers against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (3.53 for LSC and 3.08 for HSC) collected in the starter, grower, and finisher phases and pleuritis scores at slaughter (0.51 for LSC and 0.20 for HSC) were greater for LSC pigs compared with HSC pigs (P \u2264 0.01), illustrating that sanitary conditions affected health conditions. The ADG and G:F were greater for HSC pigs compared with LSC pigs (P \u2264 0.01). The number of white blood cells (WBC) was higher in (AA-S)\u2013fed pigs compared with (AA-B)\u2013fed pigs when kept at LSC but not at HSC [SS (sanitary conditions) \u00D7 AA interaction, P = 0.04]. Pigs fed NP had a lower number of WBC compared with pigs fed LP (P = 0.02). The number of platelets in pigs fed AA-S diets was higher compared with pigs fed AA-B diets (P \u2264 0.01). A 20% reduction in dietary supplementation of Met, Thr, and Trp relative to Lys decreased G:F more in LSC pigs than in HSC pigs (interaction, P = 0.03), illustrating that dietary requirements for these AA differ depending on sanitary conditions. This study, performed under practical conditions, shows that AA requirements are dependent on sanitary conditions. Furthermore, supplementation of diets with particular AA may improve performance, especially under poor hygienic conditions. Dietary protein concentration as well as Met, Thr, and Trp supplementation can modify immune status, which may influence resistance to subclinical and clinical diseases.","publish_time":"2016-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Meer, Y.; Lammers, A.; Jansman, A.

The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 \u00D7 101 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay.

Genomic signature-based identification techniques have the advantage of being precise, highly sensitive, and relatively fast in comparison to biochemical typing methods and protein signatures. Classic biochemical typing methods were developed long before knowledge of DNA and resulted in dozens of tests that are used to roughly characterize the major known pathogens. Genomic signatures can be intended for many different purposes and applied at multiple different resolutions. Organism signatures are intended to uniquely identify the organisms involved. Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vectors that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components into the genome being modified.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slezak, Tom; Gardner, Shea; Allen, Jonathan; Vitalis, Elizabeth; Torres, Marisa; Torres, Clinton; Jaing, Crystal","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88ee8a63427422c89a01061e86807f4ac8148681.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149865.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123820068000293; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820068000293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Genomic signatures","identification of signatures","protein signatures","Mechanism signatures","Organism signatures","Method signatures present","genomic DNA","potential genetic engineering","genome","independent of organisms","specific organisms","evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering","Genomic signature-based identification techniques","Classic biochemical typing methods","major known pathogens","particular genes","foreign genes","different purposes","knowledge of DNA","important mechanisms","bacterial vectors","primary reason","secondary reason","multiple different resolutions","comparison","antibiotic resistance","functional properties","virulence","advantage","issues","best thought","dimension","chapter","microbial forensic goals","biodefense","related components","host range","Publisher Summary","traces","RNA","dozens of tests","millennia"],"language":"en"},

Cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory disease involves significant inflammation and excessive oxidative stress, and exposure to air pollutants can magnify the lung damage. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the short-term variation in the concentration of air pollutants in metropolitan S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil, and the occurrence of respiratory exacerbations in children and adolescents with CF. Methods A longitudinal panel of repeated measurements was obtained from 103 patients attending the outpatient center of our institution from September 6, 2006 through September 4, 2007. Daily concentrations of inhaled particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (O3), carbon monoxide, and meteorologic variables, such as the minimum temperature and relative humidity, were evaluated. The generalized estimation equation model for binomial distribution was used to assess the impact of these measurements on the occurrence of acute respiratory exacerbations. Results In total, 103 patients with CF (median age, 8.9 years) made 408 visits, with a mean \u00B1 SD of 4 \u00B1 1.74 visits per patient (range, 2-9). A respiratory disease exacerbation was diagnosed on 142 visits (38.4%). An interquartile range increase in the O3 concentration (45.62 \u03BCg/m3) had a positive, delayed (2 days after exposure) effect on the risk of a respiratory exacerbation (relative risk = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.14-3.02).

Inevitable overcrowding during the pilgrims\u0027 stay greatly increases the risk of acquiring and spreading infectious diseases, especially respiratory diseases. Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for all relevant papers published prior to February 2018 that evaluated the prevalence of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections, including pneumonia, among Hajj pilgrims, as well as their influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status. Results A total of 61 papers were included in the review. Both cohort- and hospital-based studies provide complementary data, and both are therefore necessary to provide a complete picture of the total burden of respiratory diseases during the Hajj. Respiratory symptoms have been common among Hajj pilgrims over the last 15 years. In cohorts of pilgrims, cough ranged from 1.9% to 91.5%. However, the prevalence rates of the most common symptoms (cough, sore throat, and subjective fever) of influenza-like illness (ILI) varied widely across the included studies. These studies have shown variable results, with overall rates of ILI ranging from 8% to 78.2%. These differences might result from differences in study design, study period, and rates of vaccination against seasonal influenza that ranged from 1.1% to 100% among study participants. Moreover, the definition of ILI was inconsistent across studies. In hospitalized Hajj pilgrims, the prevalence of pneumonia, that remains a major concern in critically ill patients, ranged from 0.2% to 54.8%. Conclusions Large multinational follow-up studies are recommended for clinic-based syndromic surveillance, in conjunction with microbiological surveillance. Matched cohorts ensure better comparability across studies. However, study design and data collection procedures should be standardized to facilitate reporting and to achieve comparability between studies. Furthermore, the definition of ILI, and of most common symptoms used to define respiratory infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection), need to be precisely defined and consistently used. Future studies need to address potential effect of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine in the context of the Hajj pilgrimage.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benkouiten, Samir; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Memish, Ziad A.; Albarrak, Ali; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8547d28ef48705d3c5a914947cededb03689d14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110718.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893918302734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528743/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893918302734; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.12.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus"],"locations":["Islamic Hajj","Mecca"],"keyphrases":["Respiratory symptoms","included studies","Future studies","hospitalized Hajj pilgrims","hospital-based studies","common symptoms","prevalence of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections","study design","total burden of respiratory diseases","prevalence rates","Islamic Hajj pilgrimage","cohorts of pilgrims","definition of ILI","overall rates of ILI","study period","rates of vaccination","prevalence of pneumonia","seasonal influenza","study participants","Conclusions Large multinational follow-up studies","upper respiratory tract infection","potential effect of influenza","infectious diseases","cough","differences","pneumococcal vaccination status","pneumococcal vaccine","complementary data","syndromic surveillance","microbiological surveillance","better comparability","Matched cohorts","variable results","relevant papers","data collection procedures","Mecca","sore throat","Scopus databases","subjective fever","context","world\u0027s largest annual mass gatherings","complete picture","Abstract Background","MEDLINE","PubMed","major concern","conjunction","pilgrims\u0027","ill patients","Method","risk","reporting","illness","Inevitable overcrowding","years","review"],"language":"en"},

However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported. Objective The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity. Methods A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were \u201CChikungunya\u201D AND \u201CDiabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma\u201D. Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. Results Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4- to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p\u003C0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p =0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes. Conclusion Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection. These findings may be relevant in developing public health measures and practices targeting CHIKV patients with comorbidities to avert the severe outcome of the infectious disease.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badawi, Alaa; Ryoo, Seung Gwan; Vasileva, Denitsa; Yaghoubi, Sahar","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f1a42a65b20b1ba6e211e411f459cd8ea1af14b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110669.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277382/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217303302; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.12.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217303302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV patients","CHIKV infection","severe CHIKV cases","severe outcome of CHIKV","cardiac diseases","severe infection outcome","CI","non-severe cases","higher risk of severe infection","higher proportion of diabetes","Cardiovascular Diseases","risk of severe disease complications","significant increased prevalence of diabetes","overall prevalence of comorbidities","prevalence of chronic comorbidities","frequency of comorbidities","asthma","Coronary Artery Diseases","Conclusion Hypertension","disease severity","obesity","infectious disease","chikungunya virus","search strategy","meta-analysis","Search terms","Meta-analyses","co-existing medical conditions","public health measures","Stroke","practices","years of age","Abstract Background Epidemiologic evidence","present study","systematic review","possible contributions","Objective","aim","online databases","Diabetic subjects","estimates","Results","younger counterparts","prevalent comorbidity","findings","Methods","articles"],"language":"en"},

As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission. OBJECTIVE: Scoping review of literature examining microbial\u0027s presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings. METHODS: A search (PubMed\u0026GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005\u2013December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings. CONCLUSIONS: While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olsen, Matthew; Campos, Mariana; Lohning, Anna; Jones, Peter; Legget, John; Bannach-Brown, Alexandra; McKirdy, Simon; Alghafri, Rashed; Tajouri, Lotti","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07c3abe452fc506dac95dfb918aaec8e1a89c814.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187827.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301721?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301721; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["possible role of mobile phones","HC settings","community settings","English language studies","microbial organisms","microbial transmission","community samples","microbial identification","presence of fungi","presence of bacteria","general community","transmission of microbial infections","Scoping review of literature","microbial\u0027s presence","numerous identified organisms present","health care","Staphylococcus aureus","RNA viruses","possible breeding grounds","potential global public health risk","Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci","Acinetobacter","epidemics","work","Trojan horse","search","PubMed","COVID","issue of SARS","Methicillin-resistant","pandemics","OBJECTIVE","specific microorganisms","species","Escherichia coli","METHODS","GoogleScholar","modern society","study","Bacillus","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","total","sampling","BACKGROUND","countries"],"language":"en"},

This HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay is simple and rapid, and amplification can be completed within 35min under isothermal conditions at 60\u00B0C. The 100% detection limit of HIV-1 RT-LAMP was determined using a standard strain (WHO HIV-1 [97/656]) in octuplicate and found to be 120 copies/ml. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated for use for clinical diagnosis using plasma samples collected from 57 HIV-1-infected and 40 uninfected individuals in Cameroon, where highly divergent HIV-1 strains are prevalent. Of the 57 samples from infected individuals, 56 harbored group-M HIV-1 strains, such as subtypes A, B, G, F2, and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) _01, _02, _09, _11, _13; all were RT-LAMP positive. One sample harboring group-O HIV-1 and the 40 HIV-1-uninfected samples were RT-LAMP negative. These findings indicate that HIV-1 RT-LAMP can detect HIV-1 group-M RNA from plasma samples rapidly and with high sensitivity and specificity. These data also suggest that this RT-LAMP assay can be useful for confirming HIV diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosaka, Norimitsu; Ndembi, Nicaise; Ishizaki, Azumi; Kageyama, Seiji; Numazaki, Kei; Ichimura, Hiroshi","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bc4d92dcd27012532757bc3b0c55b8dff1319b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112927.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409000020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19186193/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.01.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409000020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

This retrospective study assessed Aspergillus fumigatus real time qPCR (MycoGENIE\u00AE) in BAL to diagnose IA and identify azole-resistant strains. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data from 114 hematology patients (69% HSCT recipients; 29% on mould active agents) from years 2012-2017 were collected; and 123 BAL samples were tested with qPCR (cutoff: Ct \u003C 40) and galactomannan (GM, Platelia\u00AE, cutoff: 0.5 ODI).

Proven IA was diagnosed in two cases (1.6%), probable in 28 (22.8%), possible in 27 (22%), atypical in 14 (11.4%). qPCR was positive in 39 samples (31.7%). Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR for proven/probable IA (vs no-IA; atypical-IA excluded) were 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23\u201359) and 69% (95%CI: 55\u201381), respectively.

We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 0.00002 mol m\u22122), a low reduction in CO (\u003C0.03 mol m\u22122), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1\u20130.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February\u2013March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m\u22123 across a large part of the globe during April\u2013July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread.

However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The purpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling. Methods Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient\u0027s symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar. Results The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased. Conclusion To early end of the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus such as social distancing and mask wearing are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through efforts by the quarantine authorities.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Sunhwa Choi; Ki, Moran","journal":"Epidemiology and health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea","Daegu"],"keyphrases":["total number of patients","number of confirmed patients","Daegu","isolating patients","estimated R","transmission period","reproduction number","Korean outbreak","COVID","NGP","efforts","estimated initial R","effect of preventive measures","epidemic","peak","days","main area of outbreak","transmission rate decreases","early end","effectiveness of preventive measures","Hubei Province","mathematical modeling","North Gyeongsang Province","Methods Deterministic mathematical model","mask wearing","social distancing","novel coronavirus disease","SEIHR","spread","Results","patient\u0027s symptom onset date","public","participation","Objectives","quarantine authorities","policy","Conclusion","size","value","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Hematology and serum biochemistry have never been studied in captive or free\u2010ranging populations of Sechuran foxes (Lycalopex sechurae). OBJECTIVES: The purposes of the study were to determine hematologic and serum biochemical RI in Sechuran foxes and to explore differences in these variables related to sex and overall life circumstances. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 15 free\u2010ranging and 15 captive Sechuran foxes. Hematology variables were assessed by blood smear examination and automated analyzer methodology. Serum biochemical analysis was performed by automated analyzer methodology. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable. Data obtained from free\u2010ranging and captive groups were statistically compared and RIs were calculated. RESULTS: Captive Sechuran foxes had significantly (P \u003C .05) higher MCH, MCHC, and eosinophil counts and significantly lower band neutrophil counts than free\u2010ranging foxes. Free\u2010ranging Sechuran foxes had significantly (P \u003C .05) higher serum lipase and globulins and significantly lower albumin, total bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin than captive foxes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there are hematologic and serum biochemical differences between captive and free\u2010ranging Sechuran fox populations. Hence, such differences should be considered when using these variables to assess the health status of this species.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lescano, Jes\u00FAs; Quevedo, Miryam; Villalobos, Marina; Gavidia, Cesar M.","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dc36e185924fb9514e1ef0e7f2558757df2c35c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29364544/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12568","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["captive foxes","captive Sechuran foxes","populations of Sechuran foxes","serum biochemical differences","captive groups","Serum biochemical analysis","serum biochemical RI","serum biochemistry","Sechuran fox populations","serum biochemical reference values","higher serum lipase","analytic differences","analytic methods","Hematology variables","automated analyzer methodology","methods of capture","wildlife populations","lower albumin","total bilirubin","indirect bilirubin","overall management","lower band neutrophil counts","Blood samples","higher MCH","blood smear examination","composition of animal groups","overall life circumstances","captivity","eosinophil","diet","globulins","restraint","sex","preanalytic","significant variations","study","BACKGROUND","Lycalopex sechurae","MCHC","health status","RESULTS","Descriptive statistics","species","OBJECTIVES","purposes","findings","RIs","CONCLUSIONS","Data"],"language":"en"},

During February 5-March 17, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received and transmitted contact information for 11,574 international travelers to 51 of 61 local health jurisdictions at a cost of 1,694 hours of CDPH personnel time. If resources permitted, local health jurisdictions contacted travelers, interviewed them, and oversaw 14 days of quarantine, self-monitoring, or both, based on CDC risk assessment criteria for COVID-19. Challenges encountered during follow-up included errors in the recording of contact information and variation in the availability of resources in local health jurisdictions to address the substantial workload. Among COVID-19 patients reported to CDPH, three matched persons previously reported as travelers to CDPH. Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California. Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations. State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myers, Jennifer F; Snyder, Robert E; Porse, Charsey Cole; Tecle, Selam; Lowenthal, Phil; Danforth, Mary E; Powers, Edward; Kamali, Amanda; Jain, Seema; Fritz, Curtis L; Chai, Shua J","journal":"MMWR.

During the past 50 y, tremendous advances in both clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans have been observed. The major factor contributing to zinc deficiency is high phytate-containing cereal protein intake in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion subjects may be zinc deficient. Conditioned deficiency of zinc has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, and other chronic illnesses. Major clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live beyond the age of 25 y, and they died because of intercurrent infections. In 1963, we knew of only 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know of \u003E300 enzymes and \u003E1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells participate in signaling events. Zinc has been very successfully used as a therapeutic modality for the management of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson\u2019s disease, the common cold and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry type of macular degeneration and is very effective in decreasing the incidence of infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prasad, Ananda S.","journal":"Advances in Nutrition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58de68bda888e34568a34ed8f23997b3dbedb775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3649098.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3945/an.112.003210; https://academic.oup.com/advances/article-pdf/4/2/176/23736058/176.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wilson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["zinc deficiency","essentiality of zinc","Conditioned deficiency of zinc","zinc-deficient dwarfs","intracellular free zinc","basic sciences of zinc metabolism","humans","sickle cell disease","liver disease","Wilson\u2019s disease","chronic renal disease","patients","cell-mediated immunity","enzymes","activities","messenger of immune cells","Major clinical problems","immune dysfunction","chronic illnesses","major factor","cereal protein intake","high phytate","growth retardation","age-related dry type of macular degeneration","management of acute diarrhea","children","prevention of blindness","tremendous advances","malabsorption syndrome","developing world","antioxidant","Middle East","therapeutic modality","incidence of infection","cognitive impairment","transcription factors","elderly","anti-inflammatory agent","subjects","intercurrent infections","events"],"language":"en"},

The presence of bacteria induces an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes. There is a direct relationship between the degree of impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, the density of bacteria in mucus and the number of leukocytes in the sputum. Purulent sputum is a good marker of a high bacterial load. Eventually, if the number of leukocytes is high, their normal activity could decrease the effectiveness of the drainage system, increase the bronchial obstruction and probably damage the lung parenchyma. Whenever the density of bacteria in the bronchial lumen is \u2265 10(6) CFU/mL, there is a high probability that the degree of inflammatory response will lead to a vicious cycle which in turn tends to sustain the process. This situation can arise during the clinical course of any acute exacerbation of CB, independently of its aetiology, provided the episode is sufficiently severe and/or prolonged. Fluoroquinolones of the third and fourth generation are bactericidal against most microorganisms usually related to acute exacerbations of CB. Their diffusion to bronchial mucus is adequate. When used in short (5-day) treatment they reduce the bacterial load in a higher proportion than is achieved by \u03B2lactam or macrolide antibiotics given orally. Although the clinical cure rate is similar to that obtained with other antibiotics, the time between exacerbations could be increased.","publish_time":"2015-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mensa, J.; Trilla, A.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d8ef8845a3bc5696ff3aad2063793e36145701c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/53b7087c5519fd69c606a2d3de52e9b6b7799945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128137.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14613215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14613215","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchial obstruction","bronchial mucus","mucocilliary drainage system","high bacterial load","density of bacteria","bronchial lumen","number of leukocytes","acute exacerbations of CB","bacterial colonisation of bronchial secretion","degree of inflammatory response","effectiveness","acute exacerbation of CB","high probability","presence of bacteria","lead","degree of impairment","airflow obstruction","clinical course","Purulent sputum","macrolide antibiotics","clinical cure rate","good marker","chronic bronchitis","\u03B2lactam","pathological changes","microorganisms","treatment","higher proportion","normal activity","vicious cycle","generation","turn","direct relationship","day","diffusion","lung parenchyma","episode","situation","aetiology","time","Fluoroquinolones","process","CFU"],"language":"en"},

Sited entirely within the laboratory, the network is not connected to a modem. Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.","publish_time":"1993-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stokes, K.Jerry; Morris, David J.; Klapper, Paul E.; Semple, A.David; Crosdale, Elaine; Corbitt, Gerald","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a5e416e18ae6d340462821fed30176e12aa4a03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0166093493901136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093493901136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new patient records","replacement of hard","records of clinical information","patient names","duplicate records","patient confidentiality","results reporting","specimen request cards","specimen request forms","subsequent retrieval of specimen","system protection","event of hard disc failure","on-line access","searches","result information","hospital data bases","original clinical information","large diagnostic virology laboratory","automatic generation of laboratory worksheets","network of personal computers","restricted access","personal identifiers","human immunodeficiency virus test results","magnetic tape","daily streaming","availability","surname","long-term storage","sex","date of birth","entry","file server","Future goals","development","modem","clinician","Retention"],"language":"en"},

We assessed if clinical characteristics and blood inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia. METHODS: Western Australian children (\u226417 years) hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were recruited and clinical symptoms and management data were collected. C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell counts (WCC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were measured as part of routine care. Clinical characteristics and biomarker levels were compared between cases with definite bacterial pneumonia (clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural fluid), presumed viral pneumonia (presence of \u22651 virus in nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia), and other pneumonia cases (pneumonia in the absence of criteria for either definite bacterial or presumed viral pneumonia). The area-under-curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for varying biomarker levels were used to characterise their utility for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia. For biomarkers with AUC \u003E 0.8 (fair discriminator), Youden index was measured to determine the optimal cut-off threshold, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative) were calculated. We investigated whether better discrimination could be achieved by combining biomarker values with the presence/absence of symptoms. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 pneumonia cases were enrolled: 30 with definite bacterial pneumonia, 118 with presumed viral pneumonia and 82 other pneumonia cases. Differences in clinical signs and symptoms across the groups were noted; more definite bacterial pneumonia cases required intravenous fluid and oxygen supplementation than presumed viral or other pneumonia cases. CRP, WCC and ANC were substantially higher in definite bacterial cases. For a CRP threshold of 72 mg/L, the AUC of ROC was 0.82 for discriminating definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonia. Combining the CRP with either the presence of fever (\u226538(\u03BF)C) or the absence of rhinorrhea improved the discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Combining elevated CRP with the presence or absence of clinical signs/ symptoms differentiates definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia better than CRP alone. Further studies are required to explore combination of biomarkers and symptoms for use as definitive diagnostic tool.

They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen- and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood.

Most of these infections, with the exception of rhinovirus as well as adenovirus and parainfluenza virus in tropical areas, are seasonal variable and occur before and after HCT. Infectious disease management includes sampling of respiratory specimens from nasopharyngeal washes or swabs as well as sputum and tracheal or tracheobronchial lavages. These are subjected to improved diagnostic tools including multiplex PCR assays that are routinely used allowing for expedient detection of all respiratory viruses. Disease progression along with high mortality is frequently associated with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus infections.

For wild canids, seroprevalence of antibodies to canine parvovirus, canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus and Toxoplasma gondii was 100 (21/21), 33 (7/21), 5 (1/19) and 68 (13/19) percent, respectively. Antibodies against canine distemper virus, Neospora caninum or Babesia spp. were not found. We tested domestic dogs for antibodies to canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and Babesia spp., and seroprevalences were 59 (41/70), 66 (46/70), and 42 (40/70) percent, respectively, with significantly higher prevalence in domestic dogs for CDV (P \u003C 0.001) and Babesia spp. (P = 0.002), and in wild canids for CPV (P \u003C 0.001). We report for the first time evidence of exposure to canine coronavirus in wild hoary foxes, and Platynossomun sp. infection in wild maned wolves. Maned wolves are more exposed to helminths than crab-eating foxes, with a higher prevalence of Trichuridae and Ancylostomidae in the area. The most common ectoparasites were Amblyomma cajennense, A. tigrinum, and Pulex irritans.

Their name refers to their unique morphological features: an elongated bacilliform core with two rounded ends is surrounded by a membrane that may either tightly adhere to or \u201Cshrink-wrap\u201D it, without respecting the capsid\u0027s rod shape; in the first instance, straight or curved rhabdovirus-like particles are formed, whereas in the latter a biconcave disk results. Torovirus history is brief: the first representative, Berne virus (BEV), was isolated in Berne, Switzerland, in 1972 from a rectal swab taken from a horse with diarrhea 1 week before it died. BEV is the only equine torovirus isolate that replicates in cell culture; since most molecular data have been obtained with this isolate, BEV has been acknowledged as the torovirus prototype. Recognition of toroviruses as a new group of potentially pathogenic viruses came seven years after the discovery of BEV, when morphologically similar particles were discovered by electron microscopy (EM) in stool specimens from calves with severe diarrhea in a dairy herd in Breda, Iowa. Despite repeated attempts, BRV has not been adapted to the growth in cell or tissue culture, a problem which has hampered its biochemical, bio-physical, and molecular characterization. However, its pathogenesis and pathology have been studied in the experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves, showing that BRV infections may cause gastroenteritis. Recently, Vanopdenbosch et al. reported the isolation of a torovirus-like virus from the respiratory tract of calves with pneumonia, suggesting that both enterotropic and pneumotropic bovine toroviruses exist. Besides the established toroviruses of horses and cattle, torovirus-like particles (TVLPs) have been found by EM in different animal species; torovirus antibodies appear to be widespread in higher vertebrates, indicating that these viruses infect a broad range of animal hosts. The possibility of a torovirus infecting humans was first reported in 1984 and has become more likely in view of the recent data. This chapter is intended to update the information about toroviruses, and to describe the similarities and differences with the related coronaviruses.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koopmans, Marion; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1db3a936236ab5a5c4fec52b591e7beb64a82f08.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708600500; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708600500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BEV"],"organizations":["Recognition"],"locations":["Switzerland","Iowa"],"keyphrases":["torovirus antibodies","equine torovirus","Torovirus history","torovirus prototype","torovirus infecting humans","Recognition of toroviruses","discovery of BEV","Publisher Summary Toroviruses","established toroviruses of horses","pneumotropic bovine toroviruses","pathogenic viruses","cell culture","respiratory tract of calves","similar particles","BRV infections","Berne virus","molecular data","isolate","infected gnotobiotic calves","group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses","new group","severe diarrhea","generalized infections","tissue culture","recent data","molecular characterization","different animal species","broad range of animal hosts","elongated bacilliform core","stool specimens","dairy herd","electron microscopy","instance","rounded ends","representative","cattle","unique morphological features","bio-physical","Breda","curved rhabdovirus","problem","similarities","enterotropic","pneumonia","years","replicates","higher vertebrates","differences","related coronaviruses","Iowa","rectal swab","view","animals","growth","isolation","possibility","TVLPs","capsid\u0027s rod shape","biconcave disk results","membrane","repeated attempts","Switzerland","week","gastroenteritis","information","pathogenesis","pathology","chapter","Vanopdenbosch","shrink-wrap"],"language":"en"},

Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff\u2019s spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotemporal clusters were identified for a group of cities (n = 10) in Riyadh province between 2014 and 2016. A monthly spatiotemporal cluster included Jeddah, Makkah and Taif cities, with the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV infection cluster occurring between April and May 2014.

The therapeutic strategies like targeting the viral genome emphasize the promising approach to target COVID-19. Additionally, blocking the receptor, ACE2 via the neutralizing antibodies for viral escape that prevents it from entering into the cells provides another therapeutic regimen.

Other risk factors including flock size, flock type, flock age, chicken breed and vaccination frequency were also assessed. METHODS: The study group comprised 17 flocks from 14 farms. Data relating to the factors investigated were requested on a regular basis. The Haugh unit data were used to grade eggs as good or poor based on the age and flock at the time of data collection. Cloacal swabs were collected from 20 chickens in each flock approximately every 6 weeks. RESULTS: IBV was detected from a majority of the flocks and in 68% of cases the IBV strain detected was an A\u2010vaccine\u2010related field strain. Three variant strains were detected. Detection of IBV in a flock, the farm type and flock size were identified as potential risk factors for the production of eggs with poor Haugh units. CONCLUSION: IBV is prevalent in Australian layer flocks, but infection was primarily subclinical.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes diarrhea in piglets with an age-dependent decrease of severity. RESULTS: We used 60 weaned piglets that were divided into three groups to evaluate the effect of different Zn levels added to a conventional diet (50 mg Zn/kg diet, Zn(low), control group). The other groups received the diet supplemented with ZnO at final concentrations of 150 mg Zn/kg diet (Zn(med)), or 2,500 mg/kg diet (Zn(high)). Oral challenge infection with TGEV was performed when the pigs had been fed for 1 week with the respective diet. Half of the piglets of each group were sacrificed at day 1 and 18 after challenge infection. Fecal consistency was improved and body weights increased in the Zn(high) group when compared to the other groups, but no direct effect of Zn concentrations in the diet on fecal TGEV shedding and mucosal immune responses was detectable. However, in the Zn(high) group, we found a prevention of villus atrophy and decreased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of jejunal epithelium. Furthermore, pigs receiving high Zn diet showed a down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), Zn transporter SLC39A4 (ZIP4), but up-regulation of metallothionein-1 (MT1), as well as the Zn transporters SLC30A1 (ZnT1) and SLC30A5 (ZnT5). In addition, forskolin-induced chloride secretion and epithelial resistance were controlled at a physiological level in the Zn(high) but not the other groups. Finally, in the Zn(high) group, we documented an earlier and higher systemic TGEV-specific serum antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high dietary Zn could provide enhanced protection in the intestinal tract and stimulate the systemic humoral immune response against TGEV infection.","publish_time":"2014-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chai, Weidong; Zakrzewski, Silke S; G\u00FCnzel, Dorothee; Pieper, Robert; Wang, Zhenya; Twardziok, Sven; Janczyk, Pawel; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Burwinkel, Michael","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3f4cd3e21b32b677d50fda144e8eed9ee44df8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3986850.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high Zn diet","high dietary Zn","Zn transporter SLC39A4","Zn transporters SLC30A1","direct effect of Zn concentrations","effect of different Zn levels","TGEV infection","conventional diet","respective diet","groups","fecal TGEV","virus infection","control group","Oral challenge infection","protective effect","weaned piglets","RESULTS","pigs","higher systemic TGEV-specific serum antibody response","systemic humoral immune response","intestinal tract","final concentrations","Fecal consistency","intestinal diseases","regulation of interferon","incidence of diarrhea","regulation of metallothionein","mucosal immune responses","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","decreased caspase","epithelial resistance","OAS","forskolin-induced chloride secretion","enhanced protection","oligoadenylate synthetase","IFN","ZnT1","mechanisms","prevention of villus atrophy","body weights","physiological level","SLC30A5","mediated apoptosis of jejunal epithelium","addition","age-dependent decrease of severity","animals","ZIP4","ZnO","BACKGROUND","Zinc","supplementation","week","day","ZnT5","MT1","CONCLUSIONS","Half"],"language":"en"},

Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all \u03B1-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase \u03B2-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life. In addition, HEPN domains have been recruited to perform essential functions, in particular in eukaryotic rRNA processing. These findings are expected to stimulate experiments that could shed light on diverse cellular processes across the three domains of life.

However, clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. METHODS: We identified all paramyxovirus RTIDs in allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2010 and 2014. Baseline characteristics of patients, treatment, and outcome of each episode were analyzed; ie, moderate, severe, and very severe immunodeficiency (verySID) according to HCT \u22646 months, T- or B-cell depletion \u22643 months, graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or hypo-gammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at \u003E100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P \u2264 .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Paramyxovirus RTID remains a major concern in allogeneic HCT patients fulfilling SID and verySID, emphasizing that efficacious and safe antiviral treatments are urgently needed.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spahr, Yasmin; Tschudin-Sutter, Sarah; Baettig, Veronika; Compagno, Francesca; Tamm, Michael; Halter, J\u00F6rg; Gerull, Sabine; Passweg, Jakob; Hirsch, Hans H; Khanna, Nina","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8991fb0bcc563dc28c736e05639bc604f611e84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5952916.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780847/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy077","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RTID","SID","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RTID episodes","Lower RTID","SID patients","allogeneic HCT patients","affected patients","verySID","Baseline characteristics of patients","allogeneic HCT recipients","RSV","MPV","percent","days post-HCT","months","paramyxovirus RTIDs","higher mortality","outcome","Overall mortality","PIV","Paramyxoviruses","allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","host disease","severe immunodeficiency","significant respiratory tract infectious disease","B-cell depletion","major concern","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","lymphopenia","graft","intensive care unit transfer","frequency","neutropenia","BACKGROUND","hospitalization","clinical data","human metapneumovirus","safe antiviral treatments","Oral ribavirin","intravenous immunoglobulin","CONCLUSION","hypo-gammaglobulinemia","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Despite increased viral replication, pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in immunosuppressed animals. The observation that the virus was less pathogenic in these animals suggests that disease has an immunopathogenic component and shows that inflammatory responses elicited by the virus contribute to disease.","publish_time":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prescott, Joseph; Falzarano, Darryl; de Wit, Emmie; Hardcastle, Kath; Feldmann, Friederike; Haddock, Elaine; Scott, Dana; Feldmann, Heinz; Munster, Vincent Jacobus","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87d23553b1e4abc9f23750121d6259b10da73387.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5816332.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483914/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV shedding","respiratory tissues","CoV replication","viral replication","Immunosuppressed macaques","non-immunosuppressed animals","respiratory tract","viral shedding","mechanisms of disease","Disease severity","higher levels of MERS","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral RNA","rhesus macaque model of mild MERS","immune response","immune statues","patient health status","immunocompromised status fare worse","chronic diseases","people","lungs","pathogenicity","relation","immunopathogenic component","role","inflammatory responses","pathology","days","case fatality rate","observation","confirmed cases"],"language":"en"},

Hib vaccination was introduced throughout Vietnam in July 2010 without catch-up. In an observational, population based surveillance study we estimated the impact of routine Hib vaccination on all cause radiologically confirmed childhood pneumonia in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Materials and methods In 2007 active hospital based surveillance was established in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province. Nasopharyngeal samples and chest radiographs are taken routinely from all children diagnosed with acute respiratory illness on admission. For admissions between 02/2007 and 03/2012 chest radiographs were interpreted for the presence of WHO primary endpoint pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed by PCR for the presence of Influenza A or B, RSV and rhinovirus. We employed Poisson regression to estimate the impact of Hib vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia (RCP) while statistically accounting for potential differences in viral circulation in the post vaccination era which could have biased the estimate. Results Of 3151 cases admitted during the study period, 166 had RCP and major viruses were detected in 1601. The adjusted annual incidence of RCP in children younger than 5 years declined by 39% (12\u201358%) after introduction of Hib vaccination. This decline was most pronounced in children less than 2 years old, adjusted IRR: 0.52 (0.33\u20130.81), and no significant impact was observed in the 2\u20134 years old who were not eligible for vaccination, adjusted IRR: 0.96 (0.52\u20131.72). Discussion We present early evidence that the burden of Hib associated RCP in Nha Trang before vaccination was substantial and that shortly after introduction to the routine childhood immunisation scheme vaccination has substantially reduced that burden.","publish_time":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flasche, Stefan; Takahashi, Kensuke; Vu, Dinh Thiem; Suzuki, Motoi; Nguyen, Thi Hien-Anh; Le, HuuTho; Hashizume, Masahiro; Dang, Duc Anh; Edmond, Karen; Ariyoshi, Koya; Mulholland, E.

This infectious single-stranded, positive (\u002B) sense RNA virus enters the host by binding to dipeptidyl-peptide receptors. Since no vaccine is yet available for MERS-COV, rapid case identification, isolation, and infection prevention strategies must be used to combat the spreading of MERS-COV infection. Additionally, there is a desperate need for vaccines and antiviral strategies. METHODS: The present study used immuno-informatics and computational approaches to identify conserved B- and T cell epitopes for the MERS-COV spike (S) protein that may perform a significant role in eliciting the resistance response to MERS-COV infection. RESULTS: Many conserved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes and discontinuous and linear B-cell epitopes were predicted for the MERS-COV S protein, and their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B7 allele were estimated. Among B-cell epitopes, QLQMGFGITVQYGT displayed the highest antigenicity-score, and was immensely immunogenic. Among T-cell epitopes, MHC class-I peptide YKLQPLTFL and MHC class-II peptide YCILEPRSG were identified as highly antigenic. Furthermore, docking analyses revealed that the predicted peptides engaged in strong bonding with the HLA-B7 allele. CONCLUSION: The present study identified several MERS-COV S protein epitopes that are conserved among various isolates from different countries. The putative antigenic epitopes may prove effective as novel vaccines for eradication and combating of MERS-COV infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tahir ul Qamar, Muhammad; Saleem, Saman; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Bari, Amna; Anwar, Farooq; Alqahtani, Safar","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6839065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31703698/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-019-2116-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS-COV infection","MERS-COV S protein epitopes","MERS-COV spike","T cell epitopes","T-cell epitopes","spreading of MERS","linear B-cell epitopes","putative antigenic epitopes","conserved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes","conserved B","infection prevention strategies","MHC class","peptide YKLQPLTFL","present study","peptide YCILEPRSG","HLA-B7 allele","dipeptidyl-peptide receptors","developing countries","novel vaccines","different countries","antiviral strategies","predicted peptides","highest antigenicity-score","isolation","kidney infections","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","computational approaches","human leukocyte antigen","rapid case identification","binding","host","immuno-informatics","QLQMGFGITVQYGT","resistance response","main cause of lung","Saudi Arabia","strong bonding","BACKGROUND","interactions","eradication","sense RNA virus","various isolates","significant role","desperate need","South Korea","METHODS","RESULTS","analyses","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Carbohydrates are prominently displayed on the surface of cell membranes and expressed by virtually all secretory proteins in bodily fluids. This is achieved by the events of posttranslational protein modification called glycosylation. Importantly, expression of cellular glycans, in the form of either glycoproteins or glycolipids, is differentially regulated. Cell display of precise complex carbohydrates is characteristically associated with the stages or steps of embryonic development, cell differentiation, as well as transformation of normal cells to abnormally differentiated tumor or cancer cells. Sugar moieties are also abundantly expressed on the outer surfaces of the majority of viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Many sugar structures are pathogen specific, which makes them important molecular targets for pathogen recognition, diagnosis of infectious diseases, and vaccine development. Exploring the biological information content in carbohydrates is one of the current focuses of postgenomic research and technology development. Biophysical, biochemical, and immunological methods have proven very valuable in studying carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate and carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions. Many well established immunochemical methods have been applied to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of carbohydrate\u2013antibody and carbohydrate\u2013lectin interactions. A pressing need is, thus, the establishment of high-throughput technologies to enable the large-scale, multiplex analysis of carbohydrates and their cellular receptors.

In order to eradicate an infectious disease, a method of prevention with low social cost is the most effective way. While we wait for new therapies and a vaccine, we are proposing a solution based on the existing knowledge in biomedical sciences. Here we propose to use low doses of hydroxychloroquine (50-100 mg daily orally) and intranasal interferon alpha-2b (IFN \u03B1-2b) spray (0.5 X 106 IU twice daily) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19. Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN \u03B1-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19. Since the two act on two different mechanisms, we strongly believe that the two could have additive effects in prophylaxis against COVID-19.

Moreover, during the early period of infection, the MrNV signals were highly co-localized with CAV1 signals of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway. The use of genistein as an inhibitor of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway significantly reduced MrNV and CAV1 co-localization, and also reduced the levels of MrNV infection in Sf9 cells as shown by PCR and ELISA.

DsRNA in the form of synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC) induced expression of iNOS and iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity through activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein\u03B2 (C/EBP\u03B2).

Little is known about how conventional as well as advanced treatments of sewage, such as ozonation, reduce the environmental spread of viruses. Analyses for viruses were therefore conducted for three weeks in influent, after conventional treatment, after additional ozonation, and after passing an open dam system at a full-scale treatment plant in Knivsta, Sweden. Viruses were concentrated by adsorption to a positively charged filter, from which they were eluted and pelleted by ultracentrifugation, with a recovery of about 10%. Ion Torrent sequencing was used to analyze influent, leading to the identification of at least 327 viral species, most of which belonged to 25 families with some having unclear classification. Real-time PCR was used to test for 21 human-related viruses in inlet, conventionally treated, and ozone-treated sewage and outlet waters. The viruses identified in influent and further analyzed were adenovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, hepatitis E virus, astrovirus, pecovirus, picobirnavirus, parvovirus, and gokushovirus. Conventional treatment reduced viral concentrations by one to four log10, with the exception of adenovirus and parvovirus, for which the removal was less efficient. Ozone treatment led to a further reduction by one to two log10, but less for adenovirus. This study showed that the amount of all viruses was reduced by conventional sewage treatment. Further ozonation reduced the amounts of several viruses to undetectable levels, indicating that this is a promising technique for reducing the transmission of many pathogenic human viruses.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hao; Sikora, Per; Rutgersson, Carolin; Lindh, Magnus; Brodin, Tomas; Bj\u00F6rlenius, Berndt; Larsson, D.

This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single\u2010center pediatric LT cohort (2000\u20102016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height\u2010for\u2010age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low\u2010fat or medium\u2010chain triglyceride\u2013rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non\u2010CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow\u2010up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected.

Cholesterol is a critical structural component of lipid rafts. Although the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has restricted cell tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, a non-macrophage cell MARC-145 was susceptible to PRRSV because of the expression of virus receptor CD163 on the cell surface, therefore MARC-145 cells is used as model cell for PRRSV studies. In order to determine if cholesterol is involved in PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells, we used three pharmacological agents: methyl-\u03B2 cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD), mevinolin, and filipin complex to deplete cholesterol in MARC-145. Although these agents act by different mechanisms, they all significantly inhibited PRRSV infection. The inhibition could be prevented by addition of exogenous cholesterol. Cell membrane cholesterol depletion after virus infection had no effect on PRRSV production and cholesterol depletion pre-infection did not reduce the virus attachment, suggesting cholesterol is involved in virus entry. Further results showed that cholesterol depletion did not change expression levels of the PRRSV receptor CD163 in MARC-145, had no effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but disturbed lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis. Collectively, these studies suggest that cholesterol is critical for PRRSV entry, which is likely to be mediated by a lipid-raft-dependent pathway.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Li; Zhang, Yuan-peng; Yu, Ya-ling; Sun, Ming-xia; Li, Chen; Chen, Pu-yan; Mao, Xiang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec10ff5f29f51a24b59105e8784612b65bc622c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21986526/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X11017244; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.109; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X11017244","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MARC"],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV entry","PRRSV studies","virus infection","PRRSV production","Cell membrane cholesterol depletion","inhibited PRRSV infection","cholesterol depletion pre-infection","PRRSV receptor CD163","addition of exogenous cholesterol","virus entry","non-macrophage cell MARC","cell surface","cells","model cell","virus attachment","expression of virus receptor CD163","respiratory syndrome virus","restricted cell tropism","disturbed lipid-raft","Abstract Lipid rafts","effect","critical structural component of lipid rafts","dependent endocytosis","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","macrophage lineage","expression levels","pharmacological agents","dependent pathway","important role","monocyte","methyl-\u03B2 cyclodextrin","M\u03B2CD","mevinolin","filipin complex","life cycle","different mechanisms","viruses","results","inhibition","order"],"language":"en"},

A key intervention in preventing NC is elimination of taeniasis by chemotherapy. Currently, two safe and effective taenicides, namely niclosamide and praziquantel, are available. Both are on WHO Essential Drug list, but are often inaccessible in T. solium endemic areas. Natural remedies, still widely used in some endemic areas, are frequently carcinogenic or highly toxic and as such should be discontinued. Chemotherapeutic intervention to control T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, whilst theoretically feasible, has several practical obstacles. These include poor public awareness, problems with diagnosing Taenia carriers, poor availability of taenicides where needed and low priority afforded to the control of NC. These can be overcome, respectively, by effective health education, wider use of newly developed coproantigen tests, strengthening of health services infrastructure and essential drugs distribution, and increasing the priority given to prevention of NC, as a leading cause of epilepsy in T. solium endemic areas. Information is accumulating on rational approaches to population-based short-term chemotherapeutic control measures. These are: widely available modern diagnostic tools and taenicides, treatment of any case of taeniasis, confirmed or probable, focus-oriented chemotherapy, irrespective of Taenia species implicated, improved sanitation, cooperation of veterinary and medical services, linkage with programs against epilepsy and cooperation of better educated communities. Now, it remains to take an advantage of existing tools and experience.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawlowski, Zbigniew S.","journal":"Parasitology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3282f9e092533e3005dff805771534d1e2021576.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108384.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383576905001194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576905001194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Taenia solium endemic areas","solium taeniasis","control of NC","effective taenicides","prevention of NC","health services infrastructure","Taenia species","effective health education","poor availability of taenicides","elimination of taeniasis","case of taeniasis","Chemotherapeutic intervention","serious public health problem","short-term chemotherapeutic control measures","diagnosing Taenia carriers","poor public awareness","medical services","cooperation of veterinary","available modern diagnostic tools","low priority","key intervention","leading cause of epilepsy","essential drugs distribution","focus-oriented chemotherapy","advantage of existing tools","Essential Drug list","cooperation of better educated communities","wider use","problems","developed coproantigen tests","population","programs","linkage","treatment","improved sanitation","niclosamide","immigrants","rational approaches","praziquantel","experience","international travelers","Abstract Neurocysticercosis","practical obstacles","Information","Natural remedies"],"language":"en"},

The first evidence that viruses could usurp the Ub system came from the DNA tumor viruses and Adenoviruses, each of which use Ub to dysregulate the host cell cycle (Scheffner et al., 1990; Querido et al., 2001). Today, the list of viruses that utilize Ub includes members from almost every viral class, encompassing both RNA and DNA viruses. Among these, there are examples of Ub usage at every stage of the viral life cycle, involving both ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination.

For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced \u201Cfrom without\u201D by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids.

An understanding of the infectious processes affecting this area and how to diagnose them accurately is important. 17 Visits to physicians for symptomatic complaints related to possible infections of the oral cavity are a common occurrence. Not only is it important to accurately determine the entity causing an infectious syndrome so that appropriate therapy may be given, it is also important because these interactions with the healthcare system likely result in a large amount of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. For example, a recent report by Mainous et al 41 found that 60% of over 2000 patients seeking medical care were given at least one of 19 different antimicrobial agents for acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold). Less than 2% had an accompanying bacterial sinusitis or otitis. Because the symptomatic complaints the authors described are nearly all secondary to viral infections, such antibiotic prescribing is not beneficial. Similarly, although chronic cough is often treated with antimicrobial agents, 90% is caused by smoking, postnasal drip, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic bronchitis. 50 None of these latter conditions are usually responsive to antimicrobial therapy. Data collected in the United States between 1980 and 1994 for persons presenting with a complaint of cough found that antibiotic prescription rose from 59% of visits in 1980 to 70% in 1994. 44 Interestingly, clinical characteristics did not appear to be the major influence in such prescriptions. 44 Infections related to the oral cavity are important from two very different perspectives. First, when they occur within the oral cavity, the result frequently is significant morbidity (pain), such as with pharyngitis, stomatitis, and even dental caries. The intraoral infectious syndromes and their management are diverse. For example, dental caries is a major medical and economic problem, typically associated with infection by Streptococcus mutans 17 ; however, specific microbiologic evaluation is rarely done or needed for caries. Pharyngitis is also common, but only a very few inciting microbes require specific treatment. Other local infections, such as candidiasis (thrush), actinomycosis, and sexually transmitted diseases, occur less frequently, but all require therapy. Second, an infectious disease from mouth origin can present at a distant site, resulting in both morbidity and mortality. These range from sinusitis, where the connection to the oral cavity is direct, to infections like endocarditis, where oral microbes travel through the vascular system to reach their final site of infection. The infectious diseases associated with the oral cavity have their own unique, often mixed, microbiology, making culture detection of a specific organism linked to a given episode of infection frequently complicated. Because infections in this area most often arise from normally resident flora, it is important to first understand what microbes are often found here. Nonhemolytic streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, Corynebacterium spp (aerobic diphtheroids), Neisseria spp (other than N. meningitidis or N. gonorrhoeae), spirochetes, Lactobacillus, and Veillonella spp are nonpathogenic organisms frequently present. Additionally, \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, N. meningitidis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycoplasma spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Fusobacterium spp, Mycobacterium spp other than tuberculosis (MOTT), Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp, Klebsiella ozaenae, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides spp, Actinomyces spp, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Candida albicans, filamentous fungi, and even Cryptococcus neoformans may be recovered from the oral cavity as pathogens or commensals. The best diagnostic approach is to begin with a careful history and physical examination, followed by specific laboratory testing, to detect the suspected pathogens. The purpose of this article is to highlight the likely pathogens responsible for oral cavity infections, and to suggest ways to integrate the clinical and laboratory diagnosis to establish an accurate microbiologic diagnosis for these infectious diseases.","publish_time":"1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peterson, Lance R.; Thomson, Richard B.","journal":"Infectious Disease Clinics of North America","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb33e6a05be765ade1bcd0ed71c793360212ea98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135049.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891552005701082; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891552005701082","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Moraxella","Eikenella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["oral cavity","oral microbes travel","possible infections","viral infections","local infections","infectious diseases","complaints of cough","infectious processes","antimicrobial therapy","chronic cough","symptomatic complaints","dental caries","intraoral infectious syndromes","different antimicrobial agents","given episode of infection","Corynebacterium spp","Veillonella spp","Neisseria spp","specific organism","complaint of cough","specific treatment","antibiotic prescription","unnecessary antibiotic prescribing","final site of infection","inciting microbes","example","common occurrence","result","appropriate therapy","Visits","specific microbiologic evaluation","vascular system","healthcare system","distant site","major influence","significant morbidity","chronic bronchitis","medical care","different perspectives","transmitted diseases","accompanying bacterial sinusitis","micrococci","coagulase-negative staphylococci","asthma","gastroesophageal reflux","aerobic diphtheroids","acute nasopharyngitis","postnasal drip","culture detection","spirochetes","Lactobacillus","connection","endocarditis","nonpathogenic organisms","mouth origin","economic problem","microbiology","Nonhemolytic streptococci","actinomycosis","recent report","meningitidis","management","candidiasis","pain","physicians","Mainous et","Streptococcus mutans","initial areas","gonorrhoeae","smoking","otitis","persons","thrush","sore throat","authors","conditions","interactions","stomatitis","entity","United States","resident flora","Data","patients","prescriptions","range","understanding","clinical characteristics","mortality","Peptostreptococcus spp","Mycoplasma spp","Pseudomonas spp","Actinomyces spp","Mycobacterium spp","Bacteroides spp","Fusobacterium spp","Acinetobacter spp","laboratory diagnosis","suspected pathogens","oral cavity infections","likely pathogens responsible","Haemophilus influenzae","Haemophilus parainfluenzae","viridans streptococci","\u03B2-hemolytic streptococci","accurate microbiologic diagnosis","specific laboratory testing","Moraxella catarrhalis","HSV","Staphylococcus aureus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Corynebacterium diphtheriae","herpes simplex virus","Eikenella","Klebsiella ozaenae","Enterobacteriaceae","MOTT","filamentous fungi","Candida albicans","physical examination","tuberculosis"],"language":"en"},

Advances were achieved in the understanding of the protective immune responses to MmmSC infection and immunopathological mechanisms allowing the pathogen to escape the host immune response. Based on sequencing and genomic studies, some virulence factors and metabolic pathways were unraveled leading to the identification of potential MmmSC vaccine candidates.

With sufficient sequencing depth, it is now possible to detect subtle variations between members of the same species, or between mixed species with shared biomarkers, such as the 16S rRNA gene. However, traditional sequencing analyses of samples from largely homogeneous populations are often still based on multiple sequence alignments (MSA), where each sequence is placed along a separate row and similarities between aligned bases can be followed down each column. While this visual format is intuitive for a small set of aligned sequences, the representation quickly becomes cumbersome as sequencing depths cover loci hundreds or thousands of reads deep. FINDINGS: We have developed ANDES, a software library and a suite of applications, written in Perl and R, for the statistical ANalyses of DEep Sequencing. The fundamental data structure underlying ANDES is the position profile, which contains the nucleotide distributions for each genomic position resultant from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Tools include the root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot, which allows for the visual comparison of multiple samples on a position-by-position basis, and the computation of base conversion frequencies (transition/transversion rates), variation (Shannon entropy), inter-sample clustering and visualization (dendrogram and multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot), threshold-driven consensus sequence generation and polymorphism detection, and the estimation of empirically determined sequencing quality values. CONCLUSIONS: As new sequencing technologies evolve, deep sequencing will become increasingly cost-efficient and the inter and intra-sample comparisons of largely homogeneous sequences will become more common. We have provided a software package and demonstrated its application on various empirically-derived datasets.

As different respiratory viruses exhibit similar symptoms, simultaneous detection of these viruses in a single reaction mixture can save time and cost. The present study was done in a tertiary care children\u0027s hospital for rapid identification of viruses causing SARI among children less than or equal to five years of age using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit. METHODS: A total of 155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI and processed for extraction of nucleic acids using automated extraction system. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was done to identify the viruses in the samples. RESULTS: The overall positivity for viruses in the study was found to be 72.9 per cent with a co-infection rate of 19.5 per cent. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was the predominant virus detected in 25.7 per cent children followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in 19.9, 11.0 and 8.8 per cent children, respectively. The HMPV was at its peak in February 2013, HAdV showed two peaks in March-April, 2012 and November 2012-March 2013 while HRV was detected throughout the year. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real-time PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. Seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent. HMPV was the most predominant virus. However, for better clinico-virological correlation, studies are required with complete work up of all the aetiological agents, clinical profile of patients and treatment outcome.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malhotra, Bharti; Swamy, M.

Five mAbs reacted against the S protein, two against the M protein, and one each against the N and E proteins. Two of five S protein mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells and reacted to an epitope within amino acids 490\u2013510 in the S protein. While two of the three non-neutralizing antibodies recognized at second epitope within amino acids 270\u2013350.

The first MERS case of Korea was reported on 20 May 2015, and since then, the MERS outbreak in Korea has resulted in hundreds of confirmed cases and tens of deaths. Deadly infectious diseases such as MERS have significant direct and indirect social impacts, which include disease-induced mortality and economic losses. Also, a delayed response to the outbreak and underestimating its danger can further aggravate the situation. Hence, an analysis and establishing efficient strategies for preventing the propagation of MERS is a very important and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. For the SIQ based ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach.","publish_time":"2018-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Inkyung; Heo, Seongman; Ji, Seunghyun; Kim, Kyung Hyun; Kim, Taehwan; Lee, Eun Joo; Park, Jooyoung; Sung, Keehoon","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c4f10b9e13efcf246bca26e5933080a571ba2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094113.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.10.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519317304666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031518/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317304666","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","SIQ"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS cases","MERS outbreak","propagation of MERS","MERS case of Korea","controlled SIQ model","quarantined cases","proposed SIQ model","hundreds of confirmed cases","optimal control theory","infectious compartment population","Deadly infectious diseases","optimal control approach","class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious","efficient strategies","isolation strategies","indirect social impacts","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","goal","disease-induced mortality","observed data","cost","ordinary differential equation","serious epidemics","economic losses","task of parameter estimation","coronavirus","Simulation results","tens of deaths","models","number","urgent issue","concern","analysis","danger","delayed response","situation","paper"],"language":"en"},

It is further shown that this strategy may be more widely applicable.","publish_time":"2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Soumitra; Clawson, David S.; Lavrukhin, Oleg; Sandhu, Arbans; Miller, Jim; Wilson, James M.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3f272eb9bb5a8e812361b88a863bdbc624f4601.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fae26721c445ddcd08696f186f4788d4729aceb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1868475.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340600406X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1868475?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340600406X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenoviral vectors","successful propagation of vectors","successful use","strategy","distinct adenovirus vectors","existing cell lines","derived adenoviral vector","HAdV-B","E1","diverse repertoire","rescue","chimeric adenoviruses","essential genes","HEK","necessity","efforts","serotype","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Tazi Background Although it has not been evaluated prospectively, the usual treatment for obstructive airway disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is related to graft versus host disease, consists of intensification of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. However, this treatment has a limited efficacy and is associated with a significant number of serious adverse effects, particularly infectious. Alternative treatments are therefore required. Recently, clinical and functional improvement in patients with obstructive airway disease following allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treated with inhaled combined Budesonide/Formoterol has been retrospectively reported. Methods The present prospective multi-centered, randomised double-blind trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of budesonide/formoterol (400/12\u00B5g 2 inhalations bid) versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe obstructive airway disease, not requiring initiation or intensification of systemic immunosuppressive therapy for extra thoracic graft versus host disease. The primary outcome will be the improvement of FEV1 at 1 month of treatment. The secondary outcomes will be the clinical and functional pulmonary improvements at 6 months. Expected Results The leading hypothesis is that patients treated with inhaled combined Budesonide/Formoterol will show significant improvement of their clinical symptoms and pulmonary functional testing.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bergeron, A.; Chagnon, K.; Feuillet, S.; Chevret, S.; Tazi, A.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21fcf6e2d4e563502141ef61141de43d26f6676c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126391.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842509724337; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842509724337","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

Since the proposal did not mandate PaO(2)/FiO(2) calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. SETTING: A network of teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100\u003CPaO(2)/FiO(2)\u2264200) and severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)\u2264100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200\u003CPaO(2)/FiO(2)\u2264300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)\u003E300). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Group severity and hospital mortality. RESULTS: At ARDS onset, 173 patients had a PaO(2)/FiO(2)\u2264100 but only 38.7% met criteria for severe ARDS at 24 h under SVS. When assessed under SVS, 61.3% of patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, while lung severity and hospital mortality changed markedly with every PaO(2)/FiO(2) category (p\u003C0.000001). Our model of risk stratification outperformed the stratification using baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) and non-standardised PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 24 h, when analysed by the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: area under the ROC curve for stratification at baseline was 0.583 (95% CI 0.525 to 0.636), 0.605 (95% CI 0.552 to 0.658) at 24 h without SVS and 0.693 (95% CI 0.645 to 0.742) at 24 h under SVS (p\u003C0.000001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the need for patient assessment under SVS at 24 h after ARDS onset to assess disease severity, and have implications for the diagnosis and management of ARDS patients.

We examined the utility of plasma MERS-CoV PCR as a prognostic indicator and compared the efficacies of IFN-\u03B12a and IFN-\u03B21a when combined with ribavirin in reducing MERS-CoV-related mortality rates. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 32 patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, admitted between April 2014 and June 2014, by positive respiratory sample RT\u2013PCR. Plasma MERS-CoV RT\u2013PCR was performed at the time of diagnosis for 19 patients. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 69% (22/32). Ninety percent (9/10) of patients with positive plasma MERS-CoV PCR died compared with 44% (4/9) of those with negative plasma MERS-CoV PCR. Mortality rate in patients who received IFN-\u03B12a was 85% (11/13) compared with 64% (7/11) in those who received IFN-\u03B21a (P = 0.24).

Initially, contaminated feed was proposed as a risk factor for PEDV; however, data were not available to support this theory. Here we provide proof of concept of this risk by describing a novel means for recovering PEDV-contaminated complete feed material from commercial swine sites and conducting an in vivo experiment to prove its infectivity. RESULTS: For on-farm detection of PEDV RNA in feed, paint rollers were used to collect material from at-risk feed bins from 3 clinically affected breeding herds. This material was tested by PCR and determined to be positive for PEDV-RNA (Ct = 19.50-22.20 range). To test infectivity, this material was pooled (Ct = 20.65) and a Treatment group of 3-week old PEDV-na\u00EFve piglets were allowed to consume it via natural feeding behavior. For the purpose of a Positive control, piglets were allowed to ingest feed spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 18.23) while the negative control group received PEDV-free feed. Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding were observed in both the Positive control and Treatment group\u2019 post-consumption with virus and microscopic lesions detected in intestinal samples No evidence of infection was observed in the Negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for PEDV infection of na\u00EFve pigs using natural feeding behavior.","publish_time":"2014-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dee, Scott; Clement, Travis; Schelkopf, Adam; Nerem, Joel; Knudsen, David; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/449a30a14d55d5eb735468fac84e2dca5bcf75e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4363994.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0176-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091641/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV RNA","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-free feed","PEDV-RNA","stock PEDV","PEDV-contaminated complete feed material","contaminated feed","PEDV infection of na\u00EFve pigs","Clinical signs of PEDV infection","farm detection of PEDV RNA","week old PEDV-na\u00EFve piglets","at-risk feed bins","Positive control","negative control group","Treatment group","evidence of infection","natural feeding behavior","proof of concept","data","infectivity","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","initial detection","risk factor","Negative controls","commercial swine sites","US swine industry","post-consumption","vomiting","microscopic lesions","vehicle","intestinal samples","paint rollers","novel means","viral shedding","experiment","purpose","breeding herds","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","PCR","theory","range"],"language":"en"},

The distribution of zoonotic diseases associated with companion animals such as dogs and cats is not uniform around the world, and moving animals between regions, countries, and continents carries with it the risk of relocating the pathogens they might harbor. Critical among these zoonotic diseases are rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmania. In addition, the protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia duodenalis, are also significant agents for human disease of pet origin. Considerable effort is applied to controlling movements of companion animals, particularly dogs, into the European Union. However, free movement of people and their pets within the European Union is a risk factor for the translocation of diseases and their vectors.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether influenza is a significant and unrecognised underlying precipitant of AMI. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia, during 2008 to 2010. PATIENTS: Cases were inpatients with AMI and controls were outpatients without AMI at a hospital in Sydney, Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was laboratory evidence of influenza. Secondary outcome was baseline self-reported acute respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: Of 559 participants, 34/275 (12.4%) cases and 19/284 (6.7%) controls had influenza (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.54); half were vaccinated. None were recognised as having influenza during their clinical encounter. After adjustment, influenza infection was no longer a significant predictor of recent AMI. However, influenza vaccination was significantly protective (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85), with a vaccine effectiveness of 45% (95% CI 15% to 65%). CONCLUSIONS: Recent influenza infection was an unrecognised comorbidity in almost 10% of hospital patients. Influenza did not predict AMI, but vaccination was significantly protective but underused. The potential population health impact of influenza vaccination, particularly in the age group 50\u201364 years, who are at risk for AMI but not targeted for vaccination, should be further explored. Our data should inform vaccination policy and cardiologists should be aware of missed opportunities to vaccinate individuals with ischaemic heart disease against influenza.","publish_time":"2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacIntyre, C Raina; Heywood, Anita E; Kovoor, Pramesh; Ridda, Iman; Seale, Holly; Tan, Timothy; Gao, Zhanhai; Katelaris, Anthea L; Siu, Ho Wai Derrick; Lo, Vincent; Lindley, Richard; Dwyer, Dominic E","journal":"Heart","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a93e94979a6515ea242233cf8bb7e6592d174b1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3841753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966030/; https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304320","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMI"],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["influenza season","Recent influenza infection","laboratory evidence of influenza","potential population health impact of influenza vaccination","significant predictor of recent AMI","vaccination policy","unrecognised underlying precipitant of AMI","hospital patients","Primary outcome","Secondary outcome","Sydney","Australia","controls","Cases","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","Tertiary referral hospital","self-reported acute respiratory tract infection","unrecognised comorbidity","acute myocardial infarction","indirect epidemiological evidence","studies","individuals","increases","cardiovascular hospitalisations","cardiologists","all-cause mortality","aware of missed opportunities","ischaemic heart disease","death","inpatients","outpatients","BACKGROUND","SETTING","age group","DESIGN","Case-control study","years","data","CONCLUSIONS","risk","clinical encounter","adjustment","RESULTS","participants","vaccine effectiveness","half","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: Seven affected individuals from five families were assessed retrospectively in this study. RESULTS: Of the seven patients with LRBA deficiency, four had homozygous, and two had compound heterozygous mutations. One patient remained disease free until the last follow-up (age 17 years). The most common clinical manifestations of the six symptomatic patients were organomegaly (6/6), autoimmunity (6/6), and chronic diarrhea (5/6). Recurrent infectious episodes were observed in three patients. None of the patients had hypogammaglobulinemia at presentation. B cell subpopulation analysis revealed low numbers of switched-memory B cell numbers in two of the four tested patients. During the disease course, three of the patients died, two of them underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors, and one is under abatacept therapy. CONCLUSION: LRBA defects should always be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis for patients with autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, chronic diarrhea, and organomegalies.

However recently, the need of agents effective against poxvirus infection has emerged again. In this paper, we report an original finding that two redox-modulating agents, the ethacrynic and \u03B1-lipoic acids (EA, LA), inhibit growth of vaccinia virus (VACV) in vitro. The effect of EA and LA was compared with those of \u03B2-mercaptoethanol, DTT and ascorbic acid, but these agents increased VACV growth in HeLa G cells. The inhibitory effects of EA and LA on the growth of VACV were further confirmed in several cell lines of different embryonic origin, in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and T-lymphocytes. Finally, we have analyzed the mechanism of action of the two agents.

In contrast, they did not inhibit virus entry into the cell, expression of VACV early genes or VACV DNA synthesis.

However, the costly commercial Ulp1 and its complicated procedures limit its application in the preparation of the target protein with natural N-terminal sequence. Here, we describe the preparation of bioactive codon-optimized recombinant truncated Ulp1 (Leu403-Lys621) (rtUlp1) of S. cerevisiae in Escherichia coli using only one-step with Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatograph, and the application of rtUlp1 to cleave the SUMO fusion protein by simply mixing the purified rtUlp1, SUMO fusion protein and DL-Dithiothreitol in Tris\u2013HCl buffer. The optimal expression level of non-fusion protein rtUlp1 accounts for approximately 50 % of the total cellular protein and 36 % of the soluble form by addition of isopropyl \u03B2-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mM at 18 \u00B0C for 20 h. The purification of target protein rtUlp1 was conducted by Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatography. The final yield of rtUlp1 was 45 mg/l in flask fermentation with a purity up to 95 %. Furthermore, the high purity of rtUlp1 could effectively cleave the SUMO-tT\u03B2RII fusion protein (SUMO gene fused to truncated transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II gene) with the above simplified approach, and the specific activity of the rtUlp1 reached up to 2.8 \u00D7 10(4) U/mg, which is comparable to the commercial Ulp1. The preparation and application strategy of the rtUlp1 with commonly available laboratory resources in this study will be convenient to the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein to obtain the natural N-terminal target protein, which can be implemented in difficult-to-express protein functional analysis.","publish_time":"2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaohua; Liu, Haifeng; Liu, Yawei; Li, Yuting; Yan, Lei; Yuan, Xiaohuan; Zhang, Yufei; Wu, Yan; Liu, Jieting; Zhang, Chunlei; Chu, Yanhui","journal":"Protein J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc1cdee079fdcb1a95202db6cad74a9dda253d0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088175.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10930-016-9654-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SUMO fusion protein","purification of target protein rtUlp1","SUMO-tT\u03B2RII fusion protein","application of rtUlp1","natural N-terminal target protein","purified rtUlp1","total cellular protein","SUMO gene","optimal expression level of non-fusion protein rtUlp1 accounts","high purity of rtUlp1","final yield of rtUlp1","express protein functional analysis","natural N-terminal sequence","costly commercial Ulp1","cleavage","application strategy","preparation of bioactive codon-optimized recombinant truncated Ulp1","NTA affinity chromatography","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","final concentration","small ubiquitin-related modifier","one-step","transforming growth factor-beta receptor type","Dithiothreitol","complicated procedures","Leu403-Lys621","addition of isopropyl \u03B2-D","study","fundamental tool","available laboratory resources","soluble form","Escherichia coli","thiogalactopyranoside","simplified approach","specific activity","Tris","HCl buffer","protease","flask fermentation"],"language":"en"},

The cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines including AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, PC12 and NIH 3T3. Meanwhile, the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). Scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among solvent fractions of S. litwinowii, the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic compared to other fractions. The IC(50) values of this fraction against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 cell lines after 24 h were determined, 121.2 \u00B1 3.1, 40.9 \u00B1 2.5, 115.9 \u00B1 3.5 and 64.5 \u00B1 3.4 \u03BCg/ml, respectively. Scutellaria litwinowii induced a sub-G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to control cells indicating that apoptotic cell death is involved in S. litwinowii toxicity.

This study identifies the viral pathogens causing LRTIs in young children and compares their clinical features and disease severity. Methods Children younger than 36 months old, hospitalized at a medical center in Northern Taiwan with acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia from April to December 2007, were prospectively enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspiration fluid samples were sent for virus culture, for direct immunofluorescence test of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for rapid influenza viral identification, and for polymerase chain reaction of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human boca virus (hBoV), and human corona virus. The clinical features and laboratory findings were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 48 children were enrolled. RSV was the most common pathogen (41.7%), followed by hMPV (27.1%), hBoV, and enterovirus (both 6.3%). There were no significant differences in clinical presentation and disease severity between the RSV and hMPV groups. However, the hMPV group had a higher mixed infection rate (p = 0.038). Fourteen children had no identifiable viruses. Children with single, dual, and triple pathogens numbered 26, 7, and 1, respectively. The mixed infection rate reached 23.5% among 34 children with identifiable viruses. Children with a higher severity score had greater chance to develop asthma in the next 2 years (p = 0.042). Conclusion RSV is the most common pathogen causing LRTIs in young children, followed by hMPV. The hMPV group had higher mixed infection rate than RSV group. hBoV does circulate in northern Taiwan.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Chi-Chun; Chi, Hsin; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Huang, Daniel Tsung-Ning; Weng, Li-Chuan; Wang, Nai-Yu; Huang, Fu-Yuan","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97e32ce65400ba4c756eaf62116533251440b414.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105033.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118211000399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524612/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118211000399","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Conclusion RSV"],"locations":["Northern Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["young children","hospitalized children","RSV group","Methods Children younger","hMPV groups","LRTIs","higher mixed infection rate","Conclusion RSV","hBoV","human boca virus","human corona virus","virus culture","disease severity","clinical features","higher severity score","viral pathogens","clinical presentation","Northern Taiwan","common pathogen","identifiable viruses","direct immunofluorescence test of respiratory syncytial virus","triple pathogens","polymerase chain reaction of human metapneumovirus","rapid influenza viral identification","Background Lower respiratory tract infections","medical center","acute bronchiolitis","months old","greater chance","great proportion of diagnoses","significant differences","Nasopharyngeal aspiration fluid samples","asthma","pneumonia","laboratory findings","study","years","total","enterovirus"],"language":"en"},

Areas covered: The architectural traits of filamentous viruses and their derivatives, IAVs, facilitate the display of specific antigenic peptides which induce antibody production to prevent or curtail infection. Inoviruses provide a foundation for cost-efficient large-scale specific phage display. In this paper, the development of different applications of inovirus-based phage display vaccines across a broad range of pathogens and hosts is reviewed.

Our results showed that HIV-1 gp120 protein expressed by the recombinant VSV retained the native conformation of the protein to some degree and was recognized by two well-characterized broad anti-HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies b12, 2G12. We further showed that only one time intranasal immunization with the recombinant VSV led to production of anti-HIV-1 anti-sera in mice. In addition, we found that the anti-sera had the ability to neutralize not only HXB2 envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses but also HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses with JRFL envelopes.

This work describes the development of a synthetic oligo-cassette for positive controls for accurate and highly sensitive diagnosis of several mutations relevant to influenza virus drug resistance. RESULTS: Using influenza antiviral drug resistance mutations as an example by employing the utility of synthetic paired long oligonucleotides containing complementary sequences at their 3\u0027 ends and utilizing the formation of oligonucleotide dimers and DNA polymerization, we generated ~170bp dsDNA containing several known specific neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance mutations. These templates were further cloned and successfully applied as positive controls in downstream assays. CONCLUSION: This approach significantly improved the development of diagnosis of resistance mutations in terms of time, accuracy, efficiency and sensitivity, which are paramount to monitoring the emergence and spread of antiviral drug resistant influenza strains. Thus, this may have a significantly broader application in molecular diagnostics along with its application in rapid molecular testing of all relevant mutations in an event of pandemic.","publish_time":"2011-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Bin; Steain, Megan C; Dwyer, Dominic E; Cunningham, Anthony L; Saksena, Nitin K","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6c379baf7fcba6a32b8fdadbcd9a85032dd4729.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3168426.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutations relevant","relevant mutations","influenza antiviral drug resistance mutations","necessary positive controls","influenza virus drug resistance","sensitive diagnosis","antiviral drug resistant influenza strains","molecular diagnostics","development of diagnosis","sensitive molecular diagnostic tool","rapid molecular testing","broader application","event of pandemic","synthetic oligo-cassette","utility of synthetic paired long oligonucleotides","known specific neuraminidase inhibitor","integral component","NAI","terms of time","example","efficiency","bp dsDNA","complementary sequences","accuracy","DNA polymerization","formation of oligonucleotide dimers","sensitivity","emergence","RESULTS","emerging disease","approach","scenario","downstream assays","host","BACKGROUND","work","CONCLUSION","templates"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigated the viable bacterial population in air samples collected around the slaughterhouses used during the Hajj. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected air samples on three days from four different sites: slaughterhouses at Al-Kakia, Al-Meaisim and Al-Sharaia, and from a waste disposal area designated for the remnants of slaughter. Samples were cultured on blood agar plates for 48 h, and bacterial isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. A dendrogram using the spectra of the unidentified bacterial species was constructed, and PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed for one isolate per cluster. In total, 2500 colonies appeared on the nutrient agar plates, and 244 were purified for further analysis. Good identification was obtained for 202 (83%) isolates by MALDI-TOF MS. The most common genera were Bacillus (n = 94, 45%) and Staphyloccocus (n = 55, 26%). Poor identification was obtained for 42 (17%) isolates, and their spectra clustering revealed that these isolates belonged to 10 species. Four of these were considered to be new species.

As a result, infectious diseases remain a major challenge for deployed armed forces in the 21st century.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aoun, Olivier; Sanders, John W.; Hickey, Patrick","journal":"Travel Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d528fb8e18e41e86f19c469d567a21d507c9bc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184237.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323546966000367; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323546966000367","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psychological examinations","psychological impact","major challenge","deployed servicemen","battle injuries","medical advances","deployed armed forces","Noncombat-related injuries","policy-driven force health protection approach of physical","Abstract Medical readiness","leading causes of health issues","rehabilitation medicine","sanitation","infection control","respiratory disorders","hygiene","chemoprophylaxis","social support","fields of combat care","infectious diseases","mandatory investigations","preventive measures","deployment","wounded","vaccinations","intense stages of military operations","tremendous improvements","time","century","result","families"],"language":"en"},

The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P \u003C .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P \u003C .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P \u003C .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P \u003C .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P \u003C .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P \u003C .001).

We compared the efficacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), nadroparin calcium, with aspirin in Asian acute stroke patients with LAOD. METHODS: Acute ischaemic stroke patients with onset of symptoms less than 48 h and LAOD (diagnosed by transcranial doppler imaging, carotid duplex scan, or magnetic resonance angiography) were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous nadroparin calcium 3800 anti-factor Xa IU/0\u00B74 mL twice daily or oral aspirin 160 mg daily for 10 days, and then all received aspirin 80\u2013300 mg once daily for 6 months. This study is registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials (number 493). FINDINGS: Among 603 patients recruited, 353 (180 LMWH, 173 aspirin) had LAOD (300 had intracranial LAOD only, 42 had both intracranial and extracranial disease, and 11 had extracranial disease only). The proportion of patients with good outcomes at 6 months (Barthel index \u226585) was 73% in the LMWH group and 69% in the aspirin group (absolute risk reduction 4%; 95% CI \u22125 to 13). Analysis of prespecified secondary outcome measures showed a benefit in outcome for LMWH versus aspirin on the modified Rankin scale dichotomised at 0\u20131 (odds ratio 1\u00B755, 95% CI 1\u00B702\u20132\u00B735). Haemorrhagic transformation of infarct and severe adverse events were similar in both groups. Post-hoc analyses of patients without LAOD, and all treated patients, showed similar proportions with a good outcome in aspirin and LMWH groups (78% vs 79% and 73% vs 75%, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Overall, the results do not support a significant benefit of LMWH over aspirin in patients with LAOD. The benefits indicated in most outcome measures warrant further investigation into the use of anticoagulation for acute stroke in patients with large artery atherosclerosis, particularly in intracranial atherosclerosis.","publish_time":"2007-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Ka Sing; Chen, Christopher; Ng, Ping Wing; Tsoi, Tak Hong; Li, Ho Lun; Fong, Wing Chi; Yeung, Jonas; Wong, Chi Keung; Yip, Kin Keung; Gao, Hong; Wong, Hwee Bee","journal":"Lancet Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdfa931fdd9e83badf261cb48c582d2e90eeb94c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185651.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442207700790; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474442207700790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAOD","LMWH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treated patients","proportion of patients","analyses of patients","intracranial LAOD","aspirin group","Asian acute stroke patients","Acute ischaemic stroke patients","oral aspirin","LMWH groups","significant benefit of LMWH","extracranial disease","intracranial atherosclerosis","large artery atherosclerosis","large artery occlusive disease","months","vs","Analysis of prespecified secondary outcome measures","subcutaneous nadroparin calcium","good outcomes","similar proportions","use of anticoagulation","anticoagulation treatments","carotid duplex scan","severe adverse events","transcranial doppler imaging","onset of symptoms","anti-factor Xa IU","weight heparin","Haemorrhagic transformation of infarct","magnetic resonance angiography","low-molecular","absolute risk reduction","investigation","METHODS","BACKGROUND","modified Rankin scale","Barthel index","results","distinct pathophysiology","efficacy","odds ratio","benefits","days","study","number","INTERPRETATION","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, CoVs have evolved viral proteins that target different signaling pathways to counteract innate immune responses. Some CoV proteins act as antagonists of interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IFN production or signaling, aspects that are briefly addressed in this review. After CoV infection, potent cytokines relevant in controlling virus infections and priming adaptive immune responses are also generated. However, an uncontrolled induction of these proinflammatory cytokines can lead to pathogenesis and disease severity as described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The cellular pathways mediated by interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and 7, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2/jun, activator protein (AP)-1, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03BAB), and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), are the main drivers of the inflammatory response triggered after viral infections, with NF-\u03BAB pathway the most frequently activated. Key CoV proteins involved in the regulation of these pathways and the proinflammatory immune response are revisited in this manuscript. It has been shown that the envelope (E) protein plays a variable role in CoV morphogenesis, depending on the CoV genus, being absolutely essential in some cases (genus \u03B1 CoVs such as TGEV, and genus \u03B2 CoVs such as MERS-CoV), but not in others (genus \u03B2 CoVs such as MHV or SARS-CoV). A comprehensive accumulation of data has shown that the relatively small E protein elicits a strong influence on the interaction of SARS-CoV with the host. In fact, after infection with viruses in which this protein has been deleted, increased cellular stress and unfolded protein responses, apoptosis, and augmented host immune responses were observed. In contrast, the presence of E protein activated a pathogenic inflammatory response that may cause death in animal models and in humans. The modification or deletion of different motifs within E protein, including the transmembrane domain that harbors an ion channel activity, small sequences within the middle region of the carboxy-terminus of E protein, and its most carboxy-terminal end, which contains a PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) is sufficient to attenuate the virus. Interestingly, a comprehensive collection of SARS-CoVs in which these motifs have been modified elicited full and long-term protection even in old mice, making those deletion mutants promising vaccine candidates. These data indicate that despite its small size, E protein drastically influences the replication of CoVs and their pathogenicity. Although E protein is not essential for CoV genome replication or subgenomic mRNA synthesis, it affects virus morphogenesis, budding, assembly, intracellular trafficking, and virulence. In fact, E protein is responsible in a significant proportion of the inflammasome activation and the associated inflammation elicited by SARS-CoV in the lung parenchyma. This exacerbated inflammation causes edema accumulation leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, frequently, to the death of infected animal models or human patients.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Usera, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fbe658f410a2d47bd652aae848b8efc11c927c6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1cd621a792bc7ac02d4cdf0392ffc3feded13b0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4261026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25093995/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003025; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","TGEV","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CoV genus","CoV infection","CoV morphogenesis","MERS-CoV","small E protein","presence of E protein","activator protein","CoV proteins act","Key CoV proteins","unfolded protein responses","CoV genome replication","replication of CoVs","genus \u03B2 CoVs","innate immune responses","genus \u03B1 CoVs","proinflammatory immune response","interaction of SARS","augmented host immune responses","cellular pathways","priming adaptive immune responses","comprehensive collection of SARS","innate immune system","nuclear factor of activated T cells","virus infections","virus morphogenesis","transcription factor","viral proteins","interferon regulatory factor","activated B cells","viral infections","small sequences","pathogenic inflammatory response","nuclear factor kappa-light","proinflammatory cytokines","deletion of different motifs","small size","NF-\u03BAB pathway","cellular stress","cellular sensors","comprehensive accumulation of data","death of infected animal models","transmembrane domain","antagonists of interferon","edema accumulation","inflammasome activation","associated inflammation","carboxy-terminus","IFN production","exacerbated inflammation","potent cytokines relevant","carboxy-terminal end","PDZ domain-binding motif","deletion mutants promising vaccine candidates","apoptosis","chain-enhancer","subgenomic mRNA synthesis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","ion channel activity","strong influence","TGEV","old mice","middle region","significant proportion","PBM","assembly","regulation","variable role","MHV","human patients","ARDS","long-term protection","pathogenesis","disease severity","cases","intracellular trafficking","virulence","uncontrolled induction","main drivers","IRF","humans","modification","lung parenchyma","viruses","contrast","aspects","ATF","pathogenicity","manuscript","Coronavirus","envelope","review"],"language":"en"},

However, the high turnover of village doctors, both individually and collectively, threaten the stability of village medical teams. This research evaluated the influence of job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement on the village doctors\u2019 turnover intention, and explored the mediating role of work engagement and resilience between job satisfaction and the turnover intention of village doctors in China. METHODS: A quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire containing mostly structured items was conducted among village doctors with a sample size of 2693 from 1345 rural clinics in Shandong province, China, during May and June 2019. All variables including demographic characteristics, job satisfaction, resilience, work engagement and turnover intention were based on available literature, and measured on a 5- or 6-point Likert scale. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used. RESULTS: Up to 46.9% of the subjects had a higher turnover intention and more than 26.3% of them had a medium turnover intention. The job satisfaction of village doctors could not only have a direct negative effect on turnover intention (\u03B2 = \u2212 0.37, p \u003C 0.001), but also have an indirect effect through work engagement (\u03B2 = \u2212 0.04,=\u003C 0.001). Meanwhile, work engagement also had a direct negative impact on turnover intention (\u03B2 = \u2212 0.13, p \u003C 0.001), and resilience had an indirect negative impact on turnover intention through work engagement (\u03B2 = \u2212 0.09, p \u003C 0.001). The above results of this study strongly confirmed that job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement were early, powerful predicators of village doctors\u2019 turnover intention. CONCLUSION: According to the results, the following should be taken seriously to improve job satisfaction: reasonable and fair income, effective promotion mechanism, fair social old-age security, reasonable workload, and strong psychological coping mechanisms for work stress. The turnover intention of village doctors could be reduced through improving job satisfaction, resilience and work engagement.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuewen; Bian, Liyan; Bai, Xue; Kong, Dezhong; Liu, Li; Chen, Qing; Li, Ningxiu","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/088750280a9b691e8562ad5069ba521aec6f6015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252746/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05154-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Structural Equation Modelling"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["turnover intention of village doctors","higher turnover intention","medium turnover intention","job satisfaction of village doctors","high turnover of village doctors","resilience","powerful predicators of village doctors\u2019 turnover intention","teams of village doctors","work stress","mediating role of work engagement","influence of job satisfaction","stability of village medical teams","RESULTS","indirect negative impact","direct negative effect","rural clinics","gatekeepers of rural residents\u2019 health","indirect effect","China","fair income","reasonable workload","vital role","statistical methods","quantitative study","fair social old-age security","bivariate correlation","effective promotion mechanism","EFA","strong psychological coping mechanisms","one-way ANOVA","exploratory factor analysis","self-administered questionnaire","structured items","demographic characteristics","Structural Equation Modelling","sample size","Shandong province","variables","SEM","research","available literature","subjects","BACKGROUND","Likert scale","CONCLUSION","following"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions of 55 KD patients and 78 control subjects. RESULTS: Virus detection rates in KD patients and control subjects were 32.7% and 30.8%, respectively (P=0.811). However, there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. Comparisons between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR results and the other 37 KD patients revealed no significant differences in terms of clinical findings (including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease) and coronary artery diameter.

There are many uncertainties in such a scenario, including likelihood and size of an attack, speed of response and health system capacity. We used a model for smallpox transmission to determine requirements for hospital beds, contact tracing and health workers (HCWs) in Sydney, Australia, during a modelled epidemic of smallpox. Sensitivity analysis was done on attack size, speed of response and proportion of case isolation and contact tracing. We estimated 100638 clinical HCWs and 14595 public hospital beds in Sydney. Rapid response, case isolation and contact tracing are influential on epidemic size, with case isolation more influential than contact tracing. With 95% of cases isolated, outbreak control can be achieved within 100 days even with only 50% of contacts traced. However, if case isolation and contact tracing both fall to 50%, epidemic control is lost. With a smaller initial attack and a response commencing 20 days after the attack, health system impacts are modest. The requirement for hospital beds will vary from up to 4% to 100% of all available beds in best and worst case scenarios. If the response is delayed, or if the attack infects 10000 people, all available beds will be exceeded within 40 days, with corresponding surge requirements for clinical health care workers (HCWs). We estimated there are 330 public health workers in Sydney with up to 940,350 contacts to be traced. At least 3 million respirators will be needed for the first 100 days. To ensure adequate health system capacity, rapid response, high rates of case isolation, excellent contact tracing and vaccination, and protection of HCWs should be a priority. Surge capacity must be planned. Failures in any of these could cause health system failure, with inadequate beds, quarantine spaces, personnel, PPE and inability to manage other acute health conditions.","publish_time":"2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Kunasekaran, Mohana Priya","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b64709bd4f9ba56a4209bd32c07a89d1beec6c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6568391.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["health systems","health system failure","health system impacts","public health workers","adequate health system capacity","excellent contact tracing","proportion of case isolation","Rapid response","speed of response","attack size","available beds","days","clinical health care workers","acute health conditions","public hospital beds","inadequate beds","epidemic size","high rates of case isolation","clinical HCWs","Sydney","epidemic control","worst case scenarios","surge capacity of space","modelled epidemic of smallpox","protection of HCWs","smaller initial attack","re-emergent epidemic of smallpox","corresponding surge requirements","personnel","smallpox transmission","contacts","outbreak control","quarantine spaces","inability","resources","vaccination","PPE","Australia","Planning","likelihood","Sensitivity analysis","people","cases","priority","uncertainties","respirators","Failures"],"language":"en"},

Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction. Methods In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n=21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n=54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). Results PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR= 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p\u003C0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r= 0.59 p\u003C0.001), LDH (r=0.52, p\u003C0.001) and PCT (r=0.72, p\u003C0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay. In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p\u003C0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18). Conclusions The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaninotto, Martina; Maria Mion, Monica; Cosma, Chiara; Rinaldi, Daniela; Plebani, Mario","journal":"Clin Chim Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/246e4331050d1acfc2c0303c5a593c2ae31d376c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175898.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301753; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301753?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSP","Mitsubishi","ICU"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["PSP values higher","presepsin PSP","COVID","role of PSP","Results PSP","fact patients","ICU","consecutive patients","median","IQR","significant higher values","severe disease","significant relationship","lower values","days","respiratory Coronavirus disease","risk stratification prediction","infectious disease ward","early diagnosis","early phase","longer time","long time","severe form of pneumonia","intensive care unit","prognosis","B cells","leading complication","microbiology proven infection","Mann-Whitney test","regulatory factor","CRP","prognostic information","immune responses","sCD14-ST","routine laboratory tests","addition","subtype","Abstract Background","Japan","IW","poor correlations","Soluble cluster of differentiation","period of hospitalization","Pathfast","Mitsubishi","cut-off","concentrations","monitoring","LDH","PCT","renamed SARS-CoV","data","Methods","vs","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

These two outbreaks were judged to be declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) during 2014. This is the first time ever to have such circumstance of two PHEICs at the same time. DISCUSSION: PHEIC, which has to be declared by WHO Director General after a recommendation of IHR Emergency Committee; is observed to start in countries with fragile health system and conflict areas. Then it rapidly spread to threaten the global public health. The year 2014 has uniquely witnessed declaration of two events as PHEIC according to IHR (2005); Polio and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Both outbreaks are caused by viruses such as H1N1 which was previously declared as PHEIC in 2009. SUMMARY: Public Health Emergencies of International Concern in 2014 occurred in countries with weak health systems and conflicts and threatening the whole globe. International collaborative work is required to contain the event and to mobilize resources/capacities between countries. Moreover, public health surveillance systems as core capacity for IHR (2005) should be strengthened in all countries with focus on those with limited capacity and ongoing conflicts. The ultimate aim is timely detection of potential PHEIC events in the future along with early preparedness and response plans.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soghaier, Mohammed A.; Saeed, Khwaja M.I.; Zaman, Khushhal K.","journal":"AIMS Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1291b42497aeef11d21f1fcf33ee7e910a3396dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5690278.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2015.2.218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEIC","IHR Emergency Committee"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["international public health","countries","global public health","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","Public Health Emergencies of International Concern","public health surveillance systems","weak health systems","fragile health system","timely detection of potential PHEIC events","International collaborative work","outbreaks","recommendation of IHR Emergency Committee","current Ebola outbreak","Ebola Virus Disease","large scale wild Polio virus outbreak","core capacity","limited capacity","ongoing conflicts","West Africa","scientific communities\u0027 debates","future","issues","early preparedness","ultimate aim","conflict areas","concerns","EVD","witnessed declaration","SUMMARY","response plans","Director General","BACKGROUND","resources","capacities","focus","year","viruses","circumstance","PHEICs","H1N1","globe","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the effects of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) on influenza virus (IV)-induced F-actin restructuring and ERM phosphorylation regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase 1 (ROCK), p38 MAPK, and PKC signaling pathways in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Methods Serum containing XDY (XDY-CS; 13.8 g/kg) was acquired using standard protocols for serum pharmacology. Primary PMVECs were obtained from male Wistar rats and cultured. After adsorption of IV A (multiplicity of infection, 0.01) for 1 h, medium with 20% XDY-CS was added to the PMVECs. The distributions of F-actin and phosphorylated ERM were determined by confocal microscopy, and F-actin expression was measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of ROCK1, phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target-subunit (p-MYPT), phosphorylated MAPK kinase, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated PKC (p-PKC), and phosphorylated ERM (p-ERM) were determined by western blotting. Results F-actin reorganization in IV-infected PMVECs was reversed by XDY-CS treatment, which was accompanied by reduced p-ERM production. The p-ERM protein accumulated at plasma membrane of PMVECs infected with IV, which was also inhibited by XDY-CS treatment. In addition, XDY-CS treatment drastically reduced the levels of p-p38, ROCK1, p-MYPT, and p-PKC induced by IV infection in PMVECs. Conclusion These results show that XDY-CS inhibited influenza-induced F-actin reorganization in PMVECs by down-regulating p-ERM expression via inhibition of the Rho/ROCK, p38 MAPK, and PKC pathways. In conclusion, XDY could reduce the damage to endothelial cytoskeleton induced by IV infection, thus protecting the barriers of PMVECs.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xuan, Zinan; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Chenyue; Zhang, Shujing; Chen, Xiangyang; Li, Shuyu; Hao, Yu; Wang, Qian; Wang, Xudan; Zhang, Shu","journal":"Journal of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c29d9817b5d3f5542d1aa9ce9eceb62376817b6d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209575481630062X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S209575481630062X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERM","Rho/Rho","PKC","IV","Rho/ROCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-p38","p-PKC","phosphorylated ERM","p-ERM protein","p-ERM expression","phosphorylated p38","phosphorylated PKC","p-MYPT","levels of p","XDY-CS treatment","F-actin expression","reduced p-ERM production","IV-infected PMVECs","p38 MAPK","ERM phosphorylation","XDY-CS inhibited influenza-induced F-actin reorganization","phosphorylated MAPK kinase","PKC pathways","Results F-actin reorganization","induced F-actin restructuring","Primary PMVECs","barriers of PMVECs","filamentous actin","Rho kinase","distributions of F","plasma membrane of PMVECs","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","protein kinase C","expression levels of ROCK1","phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target-subunit","endothelial cytoskeleton","multiplicity of infection","Conclusion","pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells","microvascular endothelial cell hyperpermeability","influenza virus","serum pharmacology","Methods Serum","Yinqiao Powder","confocal microscopy","effects of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction","male Wistar rats","inhibition","ezrin","radixin","moesin","damage","standard protocols","flow cytometry","addition","western blotting","Abstract Objective","adsorption","study"],"language":"en"},

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development as it is essential for the polyprotein processing. M(pro) is initially produced as part of viral polyproteins and it is matured by autocleavage. Here, we report that, with the addition of an N-terminal extension peptide, M(pro) can form a domain-swapped dimer. After complete removal of the extension peptide from the dimer, the mature M(pro) self-assembles into a novel super-active octamer (AO-M(pro)). The crystal structure of AO-M(pro) adopts a novel fold with four domain-swapped dimers packing into four active units with nearly identical conformation to that of the previously reported M(pro) active dimer, and 3D domain swapping serves as a mechanism to lock the active conformation due to entanglement of polypeptide chains. Compared with the previously well characterized form of M(pro), in equilibrium between inactive monomer and active dimer, the stable AO-M(pro) exhibits much higher proteolytic activity at low concentration. As all eight active sites are bound with inhibitors, the polyvalent nature of the interaction between AO-M(pro) and its polyprotein substrates with multiple cleavage sites, would make AO-M(pro) functionally much more superior than the M(pro) active dimer for polyprotein processing. Thus, during the initial period of SARS-CoV infection, this novel active form AOM(pro) should play a major role in cleaving polyproteins as the protein level is extremely low. The discovery of AOM(pro) provides new insights about the functional mechanism of M(pro) and its maturation process.

In this study, we conducted serial nucleotide truncation, ranging from 1 to 190 nucleotides, to the 5\u2032 UTR of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infectious full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS. In vitro synthetic RNAs were transfected into MARC-145 cells for further genetic and virologic analysis. Our results demonstrated that the first three nucleotides of PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR were dispensable for virus viability, which however was repaired with foreign sequences. In order to assess if the primary sequence or structural element play more important regulatory roles, the CMV promoter-driven 5\u2032 UTR truncation mutant cDNA clones were directly transfected into the BHK-21 cell lines. We found that PRRSV tolerated the first 16 nucleotides sequence alteration of 5\u2032 UTR without losing virus viability. However, these revertant viruses contained a range of non-templated with unknown origin exogenous nucleotides in the repaired 5\u2032 end. Further analyses revealed that the 5\u2032 proximal stem\u2013loop 1 (SL1) in the highly structured 5\u2032 UTR was invariably required for virus infectivity. Taken together, we conclude that authentic 5\u2032-proximal primary sequence is nonessential, but the resultant structural elements are probably indispensable for PRRSV infectivity.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Fei; Lu, Jiaqi; Yao, Huochun; Wei, Zuzhang; Yang, Qian; Yuan, Shishan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/361f0401ebe6462342102ecf6b002508389bb576.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114472.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211003248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21924304/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.08.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211003248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleotides of PRRSV","PRRSV infectivity","virus infectivity","virus viability","nucleotides sequence alteration","UTR truncation mutant cDNA clones","proximal primary sequence","respiratory syndrome virus","unknown origin exogenous nucleotides","crucial roles","proximal stem","viral genomic replication","important regulatory roles","resultant structural elements","serial nucleotide truncation","infectious full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS","subgenomic mRNA transcription","range of non-templated","Arterivirus","protein translation","CMV promoter","MARC","cells","SL1","structure","untranslated region","revertant viruses","BHK","virologic analysis","study","loop","function","cell lines","synthetic RNAs","order","end","foreign sequences","analyses","results"],"language":"en"},

More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 \u002B/- 210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and non-discriminatory in stage I (473 \u002B/- 110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318).

This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal\u2013lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation.

This network is thought to accommodate the viral replication machinery and protect it from innate immune detection. We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication. Here we have investigated the effect of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on the formation of arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our approach involved ectopic expression of arterivirus nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp3, which induce DMV formation in the absence of other viral triggers of the interferon response, such as replicating viral RNA. Thus, this setup can be used to identify immune effectors that specifically target the (formation of) virus-induced membrane structures. Using large-scale electron microscopy mosaic maps, we found that IFN-\u03B2 treatment significantly reduced the formation of the membrane structures. Strikingly, we also observed abundant stretches of double-membrane sheets (a proposed intermediate of DMV formation) in IFN-\u03B2-treated samples, suggesting the disruption of DMV biogenesis. Three interferon-stimulated gene products, two of which have been reported to target the hepatitis C virus replication structures, were tested for their possible involvement, but none of them affected membrane structure formation. Our study reveals the existence of a previously unknown innate immune mechanism that antagonizes the viral hijacking of host membranes. It also provides a solid basis for further research into the poorly understood interactions between the innate immune system and virus-induced replication structures.","publish_time":"2016-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oudshoorn, Diede; van der Hoeven, Barbara; Limpens, Ronald W.

Apart from horses, S. neurona has been occasionally described causing neurologic disease in several other terrestrial animals as well as mortality in marine mammals. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of a fatal case of S. neurona-associated meningoencephalitis in a domestic cat. The causing agent was analyzed by multilocus genotyping, confirming the presence of S. neurona DNA in the tissue samples of the affected animal. Significant molecular differences were found in relation to S. neurona isolates detected in other regions of the Americas. In addition, the parasite was identical to Sarcocystis sp. identified in opossum sporocysts in Brazil at molecular level, which suggests that transmission of.

Five coronaviruses currently infect humans: HCoVs 229E and OC43, identified in the 1960s, SARS-CoV identified in March 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and the HCoVs NL63 and HKU1, identified in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features: the generation of multiple mutants during the replication resulting on a quasispecies structure of the viral population, the demonstrated ability of coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the flexibility of the genome due to a high frequency of homologue or heterologue recombinations, the ability to jump barrier species and to adapt to the new environment. Two epidemiologic pictures of HCoV infections have to be distinguished: as suggested by recent studies, HCoVs except SARS-CoV, are distributed worldwide and cocirculate during seasonal outbreaks. The distribution of the different HCoV species varies according to the geographic area and season. In contrast, the SARS-CoV is responsible of the first emerging infectious disease of this millennium, infecting more than 8000 people between November 2002 and July 2003. Its circulation has been stopped by drastic public health policy. Human coronaviruses may be also involved in enteric and neurologic diseases.

We previously showed that IFITM3 degradation is increased by its ubiquitination, though the ubiquitin ligase responsible for this modification remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 ubiquitinates IFITM3 in cells and in vitro. This IFITM3 ubiquitination is dependent upon the presence of a PPxY motif within IFITM3 and the WW domain-containing region of NEDD4. In NEDD4 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observed defective IFITM3 ubiquitination and accumulation of high levels of basal IFITM3 as compared to wild type cells. Heightened IFITM3 levels significantly protected NEDD4 knockout cells from infection by influenza A and B viruses. Similarly, knockdown of NEDD4 in human lung cells resulted in an increase in steady state IFITM3 and a decrease in influenza virus infection, demonstrating a conservation of this NEDD4-dependent IFITM3 regulatory mechanism in mouse and human cells. Consistent with the known association of NEDD4 with lysosomes, we demonstrate for the first time that steady state turnover of IFITM3 occurs through the lysosomal degradation pathway. Overall, this work identifies the enzyme NEDD4 as a new therapeutic target for the prevention of influenza virus infections, and introduces a new paradigm for up-regulating cellular levels of IFITM3 independently of IFN or infection.","publish_time":"2015-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chesarino, Nicholas M.; McMichael, Temet M.; Yount, Jacob S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/795bd84388973214e4b97ea23b80a9dc4e481117.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4532365.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26263374/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM3 degradation","defective IFITM3 ubiquitination","cellular levels of IFITM3","Heightened IFITM3 levels","steady state IFITM3","NEDD4-dependent IFITM3 regulatory mechanism","enzyme NEDD4","knockdown of NEDD4","region of NEDD4","E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 ubiquitinates IFITM3","steady state turnover of IFITM3","protected NEDD4 knockout cells","accumulation of high levels of basal IFITM3","human cells","known association of NEDD4","NEDD4 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts","human lung cells","prevention of influenza virus infections","wild type cells","IFN","ubiquitin ligase responsible","new paradigm","new therapeutic target","lysosomal degradation pathway","increase","presence","decrease","conservation","WW domain","PPxY motif","cell-intrinsic factor","modification","time","transmembrane protein","lysosomes","B viruses","Interferon","work"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, its antivirus evidence in animal studies is not satisfactory, which might be due to the lack of appropriate animal model. Previously, we had utilized restraint stress to establish mouse H1N1 susceptibility model which was helpful in evaluating the anti-virus effect of medicines targeting host factors, such as type I interferon production. In this study, this model was employed to investigate the effect and mechanism of indirubin, a natural bisindole alkaloid from Isatis indigotica, on influenza A virus susceptibility. In the in vitro study, the stress hormone corticosterone was used to simulate restraint stress. Our results demonstrated that indirubin decreased the susceptibility to influenza virus with lowered mortality and alleviated lung damage in restraint-stressed mice model. Moreover, indirubin promoted the expression of interferon-\u03B2 and interferon inducible transmembrane 3.

Central nervous system inflammation, the presumed mechanism of influenza-associated encephalopathy, is difficult to detect. Characteristics of children presenting with severe neurological complications of influenza, and potential biomarkers of influenza-associated encephalopathy are described. Methods A multi-center, retrospective case-series of children with influenza and neurological complications during 2017 was performed. Enrolled cases met criteria for influenza-associated encephalopathy or had status epilepticus. Functional outcome at discharge was compared between groups using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results There were 22 children with influenza studied of whom 11/22 had encephalopathy and 11/22 had status epilepticus. Only one child had a documented influenza immunization. The biomarker CSF neopterin was tested in 10/11 children with encephalopathy and was elevated in 8/10. MRI was performed in all children with encephalopathy and was abnormal in 8 (73%). Treatment of children with encephalopathy was with corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin in 9/11 (82%). In all cases oseltamivir use was low (59%) while admission to the intensive care unit was frequent (14/22, 66%). Clinical outcome at discharge was moderate to severe disability (mRS score \u003E 2) in the majority of children with encephalopathy (7/11, 64%), including one child who died. Children with status epilepticus recovered to near-baseline function in all cases. Conclusion Raised CSF neopterin was present in most cases of encephalopathy, and along with diffusion restriction on MRI, is a useful diagnostic biomarker. Lack of seasonal influenza vaccination represents a missed opportunity to prevent illness in children, including severe neurological disease.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Macdonald-Laurs, Emma; Koirala, Archana; Britton, Philip N.; Rawlinson, William; Hiew, Chee Chung; Mcrae, Jocelynne; Dale, Russell C.; Jones, Cheryl; Macartney, Kristine; McMullan, Brendan; Pillai, Sekhar","journal":"European Journal of Paediatric Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c02c62c25490b7a28f7db6b387cd5493f4f3b8b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128712.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316638/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090379818302034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090379818302034; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2018.09.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF","Conclusion Raised CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza-associated encephalopathy","cases of encephalopathy","majority of children","Characteristics of children","Treatment of children","severe neurological complications of influenza","presumed mechanism of influenza","potential biomarkers of influenza","documented influenza immunization","Lack of seasonal influenza vaccination","severe neurological disease","status epilepticus","Abstract Purpose Neurological complications of influenza cause significant disease","Enrolled cases","severe disability","discharge","cases oseltamivir use","biomarker CSF neopterin","MRI","mRS score","Clinical outcome","Functional outcome","useful diagnostic biomarker","retrospective case-series","missed opportunity","multi-center","Central nervous system inflammation","groups","near-baseline function","illness","criteria","intensive care unit","admission","Methods","Modified Rankin Scale","corticosteroids","diffusion restriction","Conclusion","intravenous immunoglobulin","Results"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, ubiquitination is more and more recognized as a central process for the fine regulation of many cellular pathways. Due to their nature as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the most conserved host cell machineries for their own replication. Thus, it is not surprising that members from almost every viral family are challenged by ubiquitin mediated mechanisms in different steps of their life cycle and have evolved in order to by-pass or exploit the cellular ubiquitin conjugating system to maximize their chance to establish a successful infection. In this review we will present several examples of the complex interplay that links viruses and the ubiquitin conjugation machinery, with a special focus on the mechanisms evolved by the human immunodeficiency virus to escape from cellular restriction factors and to exit from infected cells.","publish_time":"2014-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calistri, Arianna; Munegato, Denis; Carli, Ilaria; Parolin, Cristina; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e952843f8bdc91e48ca6fa5fa94d53abdfb63ff7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4092849.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells3020386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24805990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conjugation of ubiquitin","ubiquitin conjugation machinery","ubiquitin mediated mechanisms","cellular ubiquitin conjugating system","cellular pathways","cellular restriction factors","links viruses","reversible post-translational modification","target protein acts","deubiquitinating enzymes","different steps","fine regulation","chance","viral family","human immunodeficiency virus","life cycle","complex interplay","special focus","combined action of ubiquitinating","conserved host cell machineries","central process","examples","phosphorylation","nature","obligate intracellular parasites","replication","members","order","infected cells","successful infection","ubiquitination","review"],"language":"en"},

Close to or in the viral membrane, the S protein contains three distinct motifs: a juxtamembrane aromatic part, a central highly hydrophobic stretch and a cysteine rich motif. Here, we investigate the role of aromatic and hydrophobic parts of S in the entry of SARS CoV and in cell-cell fusion. This was investigated using the previously described SARS pseudotyped particles system (SARSpp) and by fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays. RESULTS: Mutagenesis showed that the aromatic domain was crucial for SARSpp entry into cells, with a likely role in pore enlargement. Introduction of lysine residues in the hydrophobic stretch of S also resulted in a block of entry, suggesting the borders of the actual transmembrane domain. Surprisingly, replacement of a glycine residue, situated close to the aromatic domain, with a lysine residue was tolerated, whereas the introduction of a lysine adjacent to the glycine, was not. In a model, we propose that during fusion, the lateral flexibility of the transmembrane domain plays a critical role, as do the tryptophans and the cysteines. CONCLUSIONS: The aromatic domain plays a crucial role in the entry of SARS CoV into target cells. The positioning of the aromatic domain and the hydrophobic domain relative to each other is another essential characteristic of this membrane fusion process.","publish_time":"2009-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corver, Jeroen; Broer, Rene; van Kasteren, Puck; Spaan, Willy","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/331d9c08ce93e1ca8843610514f7ecb1d83dd883.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2805634.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20034394/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS Coronavirus","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aromatic domain","role of aromatic","entry of SARS CoV","SARS-CoV","hydrophobic domain relative","SARSpp entry","juxtamembrane aromatic","hydrophobic stretch of S","actual transmembrane domain","SARS Coronavirus","S protein","hydrophobic parts of S","block of entry","crucial role","membrane fusion process","fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays","target cells","likely role","critical role","viral membrane","Introduction of lysine residues","lysine adjacent","glycine residue","described SARS pseudotyped particles system","spike protein","essential characteristic","receptor binding","distinct motifs","borders","cysteine rich motif","lateral flexibility","tryptophans","pore enlargement","BACKGROUND","Mutagenesis","replacement","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","positioning","cysteines","model"],"language":"en"},

Inhibition of angiogenesis is a potential anti cancer treatment strategy that is now investigated clinically. In addition, advances in the understanding of the angiogenic process have led to the development of new angiogenesis therapies for ischemic heart disease. Currently, researchers search for objective measures that indicate pharmacological responses to pro- and anti-angiogenic drugs and therefore, there is a great interest in techniques to visualize angiogenesis noninvasively. As CD13 is selectively expressed in angiogenic blood vessels, it can serve as a target for molecular imaging tracers to noninvasively visualize angiogenic processes in animal models and patients. Here, an overview on the currently used CD13 targeted molecular imaging probes for noninvasive visualization of angiogenesis is given.","publish_time":"2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dijkgraaf, Ingrid; Van de Vijver, Pieter; Dirksen, Anouk; Hackeng, Tilman M.","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/548927bfce8e3e8aa478f6f2bc6aeec93a8d6979.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125914.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089613003192; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089613003192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23643902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Angiogenesis","Inhibition of angiogenesis","noninvasive visualization of angiogenesis","angiogenic processes","development of new angiogenesis therapies","molecular imaging probes","molecular imaging tracers","angiogenic blood vessels","used CD13","anti-angiogenic drugs","anti-angiogenic factors","multi-step process","pharmacological responses","ischemic heart disease","potential anti cancer treatment strategy","objective measures","animal models","patients","understanding","advances","target","addition","researchers","overview","techniques"],"language":"en"},

A high specific response in serum was observed 25 days after the first immunization and IgY antibodies were extracted from day 47th and purified from egg yolk. A concentration of 0.84 mg of total IgY/ml of egg yolk was obtained, of which 8% were antigen specific. The ability of anti-Stx2B IgY to recognize Stx2B and Stx2 either in solid-phase or in solution were evaluated and compared with anti-Stx2B rabbit antibodies by Western blotting and ELISA. The protective efficacy of IgY against Stx2 was determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results show that IgY was able to recognize Stx2B and Stx2 in denatured conditions, attached to a solid-phase and free in solution. The anti-Stx2B IgY could effectively block the biological activity of Stx2 on Vero cells and protect mice from Stx2 challenge. The data suggest that immunization of hens with Stx2B could be a strategy to obtain at low cost a relatively high concentration of anti-Stx2 egg yolk IgY, able to neutralize Stx2 lethal activity.

A prospective case series involving 79 NSCLC patients who were enrolled in clinical trials undergoing chemotherapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, between April 1 and July 15, 2003, was studied. Whether or not there existed a delay, omission, or refusal of scheduled chemotherapy, was recorded. Whether or not our patients had been suspected of or treated as having SARS, was recorded. The patients filled out questionnaires regarding lung cancer treatment and the risk of getting SARS from the hospital. Among these patients, five were placed in an isolation unit to rule out SARS infection during this period of time, and no patient was documented to have suffered from a SARS infection after examinations. Of 373 scheduled chemotherapy injections in 79 patients, a delay in treatment occurred only 10 times. Three patients refused further chemotherapy because of a fear of getting SARS if they visited the hospital. Fifty-eight patients responded to our questionnaires. Thirty-seven patients (63.8%) were afraid of visiting hospital during this SARS infection period. Twenty-one patients (36.2%) felt that a SARS infection was more severe and fatal than their lung cancer. In conclusion, SARS is a new disease entity that is highly contagious.

Mostly used in a research setting, it is now increasingly being used in the clinical realm as well, notably to support diagnosis of viral infections, thereby calling for quality control and the implementation of ring trials (RT) to benchmark pipelines and ensure comparable results. The Swiss NGS clinical virology community therefore decided to conduct a RT in 2018, in order to benchmark current metagenomic workflows used at Swiss clinical virology laboratories, and thereby contribute to the definition of common best practices. The RT consisted of two parts (increments), in order to disentangle the variability arising from the experimental compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline. In addition, the RT was also designed to assess the impact of databases compared to bioinformatics algorithms on the final results, by asking participants to perform the bioinformatics analysis with a common database, in addition to using their own in-house database. Five laboratories participated in the RT (seven pipelines were tested). We observed that the algorithms had a stronger impact on the overall performance than the choice of the reference database. Our results also suggest that differences in sample preparation can lead to significant differences in the performance, and that laboratories should aim for at least 5\u201310 Mio reads per sample and use depth of coverage in addition to other interpretation metrics such as the percent of coverage. Performance was generally lower when increasing the number of viruses per sample. The lessons learned from this pilot study will be useful for the development of larger-scale RTs to serve as regular quality control tests for laboratories performing NGS analyses of viruses in a clinical setting.","publish_time":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Junier, Thomas; Huber, Michael; Schmutz, Stefan; Kufner, Verena; Zagordi, Osvaldo; Neuenschwander, Stefan; Ramette, Alban; Kubacki, Jakub; Bachofen, Claudia; Qi, Weihong; Laubscher, Florian; Cordey, Samuel; Kaiser, Laurent; Beuret, Christian; Barbi\u00E9, Val\u00E9rie; Fellay, Jacques; Lebrand, Aitana","journal":"Genes (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e8d0363f49f83917e0ddddf7b4322186da47dbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6770386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466373/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes10090655","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Swiss clinical virology laboratories","clinical setting","addition","bioinformatics parts","bioinformatics algorithms","clinical realm","common database","Swiss NGS clinical virology community","NGS analyses of viruses","bioinformatics analysis","order","sample preparation","overall performance","final results","comparable results","benchmark pipelines","reference database","in-house database","regular quality control tests","depth of coverage","stronger impact","significant differences","number of viruses","percent of coverage","impact of databases","research setting","definition of common best practices","DNA","current metagenomic workflows","implementation of ring trials","scale RTs","RNA microbial material","development of larger","patient samples","generation sequencing","interpretation metrics","promising technique","choice","participants","pilot study","Shotgun metagenomics","diagnosis of viral infections","laboratory pipeline","increments","lessons","variability","Mio"],"language":"en"},

No data exist on the interaction of local immune responses in rhinovirus infection. Therefore, we aimed to determine the tonsillar immune responses according to rhinovirus A, B and C infections. METHODS: We collected tonsillar samples, nasopharyngeal aspirates and peripheral blood from 42 rhinovirus positive tonsillectomy patients. Fifteen respiratory viruses or their types were investigated from nasopharynx and tonsil tissue, and rhinovirus species were typed. The expression of 10 cytokines and 4 transcription factors (IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-\u03B2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet) were studied from tonsil tissue by quantitative PCR. A standard questionnaire of respiratory symptoms and health was filled by the patient or his/her guardian. The patients were divided into three groups by the determination of rhinovirus species. RESULTS: Overall, 16 patients had rhinovirus A, 12 rhinovirus B and 14 rhinovirus C infection. In rhinovirus B positive group there were significantly less men (P = 0.0072), less operated in spring (P = 0.0096) and more operated in fall (P = 0.030) than in rhinovirus A or C groups. Rhinovirus A positive patients had more respiratory symptoms (P = 0.0074) and particularly rhinitis (P = 0.036) on the operation day. There were no significant differences between the groups in virus codetection. In adjusted analysis, rhinovirus C infections were associated with increased IFN-\u03B1 (P = 0.045) and decreased RORC2 expression (P = 0.025).

Most infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis do not present risk factors and are otherwise healthy. Our objective was to determine the genetic features associated with the risk and a severe course of bronchiolitis. Methods We prospectively evaluated 181 infants with severe bronchiolitis admitted at three hospitals over a 2-year period, who required oxygen therapy. The control group consisted of 536 healthy adults. Patients were evaluated for the presence of comorbidities (premature birth, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital heart disease), underwent nasopharyngeal aspirate testing for virus detection by multiplex-PCR, and SNPs identification in immune response genes. Patient outcomes were assessed. Results We observed association between SNP rs2107538*CCL5 and bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) and RSV-subtype-A, and between rs1060826*NOS2 and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus. SNPs rs4986790*TLR4, rs1898830*TLR2, and rs2228570*VDR were associated with progression to death. SNP rs7656411*TLR2 was associated with length of oxygen use; SNPs rs352162*TLR9, rs187084*TLR9, and rs2280788*CCL5 were associated with requirement for intensive care unit admission; while SNPs rs1927911*TLR4, rs352162*TLR9, and rs2107538*CCL5 were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Our findings provide some evidence that SNPs in CCL5 and NOS2 are associated with presence of bronchiolitis and SNPs in TLR4, TLR2, TLR9, VDR and CCL5 are associated with severity of bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alvarez, Alfonso Eduardo; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima; Bertuzzo, Carmen S\u00EDlvia; Bastos, Juliana Cristina Santiago; Baracat, Emilio Carlos Elias; Brand\u00E3o, Marcelo Barciela; Tresoldi, Ant\u00F4nia Teresinha; das Neves Romaneli, Mariana Tresoldi; Almeida, Celize Cruz Bresciani; de Oliveira, Therezinha; Schlodtmann, Patricia Godano; Corr\u00EAa, Ester; de Miranda, Maria Luisa Ferreira; dos Reis, Marcelo Conrado; De Pieri, Jos\u00E9 Vicente; Arns, Clarice Weis; Ribeiro, Jos\u00E9 Dirceu","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39f4762231a3f1ef826f0ac195f5e47aeef39f3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253610/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111917310752; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111917310752; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.12.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCL5","presence of bronchiolitis","severe bronchiolitis","severity of bronchiolitis","SNPs rs352162","TLR9","severe course of bronchiolitis","SNPs rs1927911","SNPs identification","SNPs rs4986790","TLR2","TLR4","infants","Abstract Background Acute viral bronchiolitis","VDR","NOS2","SNP rs2107538","chronic respiratory disease","respiratory syncytial virus","virus detection","presence of comorbidities","RSV-subtype","oxygen therapy","year period","healthy adults","year of life","SNP rs7656411","congenital heart disease","length of oxygen use","present risk factors","nasopharyngeal aspirate testing","multiplex-PCR","intensive care unit admission","requirement","premature birth","leading cause of hospitalization","evidence","rs1898830","rs187084","immune response genes","rs2228570","rs2280788","hospitals","control group","genetic features","progression","need","findings","rs1060826","association","mechanical ventilation","objective","Conclusions","death","rhinovirus","Patient outcomes","Patients"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we summarize how different bacteria and viruses impact morphological and functional changes in host mitochondria and how this manipulation can influence microbial pathogenesis as well as the host cell metabolism and immune responses.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiku, Varnesh; Tan, Man-Wah; Dikic, Ivan","journal":"Trends in Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3830727320785fe4b1126099e9acb811b2cccb88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32200805/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0962892420300180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962892420300180","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host mitochondria","major host responses","host immunity","mitochondria dynamics","host cell metabolism","immune responses","mitochondrial functions","bacterial infection","range of cellular activities","infections","functional changes","viruses","different bacteria","intracellular survival","Multiple pathogens","manipulation","central role","microbial pathogenesis","review","homeostasis"],"language":"en"},

This study depicts the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital; potential predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also analyzed. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed data for 67 SARS patients, who were grouped according to whether or not ARDS developed during the clinical course of SARS. Results There were 32 males (mean age, 50.3 years; range, 20\u201375 years) and 35 females (mean age, 51.1 years; range, 23\u201386 years). Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers. At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week. During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; n = 55; 83.3%), C-reactive protein (n = 55; 83.3%), aminotransferases (n = 44; 65.7%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 20.9%) were also noted. ARDS developed in 33 patients (49.3%), who were generally older than the patients in whom ARDS did not develop, male, non-health care workers, and who generally had dyspnea at the time of diagnosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with, versus those without, ARDS also tended to present with more severe lymphopenia and leukocytosis, and with higher levels of LDH and aspartate aminotransferase. The overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21/67), whereas the rate for patients who developed ARDS was 63.6% (21/33). Multivariate analyses showed that age greater than 65 years (odds ratio, OR, 10.6; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.1\u201354.1), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (OR, 13.7; 95% CI, 1.3\u2013146.9), and elevated levels of LDH (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9\u201336.9) at admission, were independent predictors of ARDS. Conclusion The clinical manifestations of SARS showed high variability, and were related to the underlying health status of individual patients. Importantly, the development of ARDS was associated with significant mortality, despite aggressive therapy.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Cheng-Yu; Lee, Chen-Hsen; Liu, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Jia-Horng; Wang, Lee-Min; Perng, Reury-Perng","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/489dc3cd19a841baa870518a82cc93697e804a30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490109701248; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490109701248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ARDS"],"locations":["Taiwan","Taipei Veterans General Hospital"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","years","development of ARDS","short-term outcomes of patients","SARS epidemic","underlying health status of individual patients","clinical manifestations of SARS","clinical course of SARS","independent predictors of ARDS","elevated levels of LDH","mean age","higher levels of LDH","age greater","clinical characteristics","range","non-health care workers","study","severe lymphopenia","admission","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute respiratory distress syndrome","elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase","history of diabetes mellitus","pre-existing diabetes mellitus","overall mortality rate","significant mortality","potential predictive factors","Taipei Veterans General Hospital","hypertension","pulmonary infiltrates","cerebrovascular accident","aspartate aminotransferase","leukocytosis","high variability","data","females","emerging infectious disease","abnormal chest radiographs","time of diagnosis","following week","odds ratio","dyspnea","aggressive therapy","Multivariate analyses","C-reactive protein","Conclusion","Methods","Results","confidence interval","creatine kinase","Taiwan","great impact","hospitalization","aminotransferases"],"language":"en"},

Many of the studies are from a quantitative perspective which has given a wider but general coverage of study and analysis on the matters. However, the impacts of context, such as living environments and social culture, on recycling activities from a qualitative as well as in-depth perspective have seldom been discussed, especially in densely populated communities. Taking Hong Kong as an example, some food waste recycling (FWR) initiatives have been launched in housing estates. However, most projects have been suspended due to many practical problems. Only a few cases are still on-going. Physical setting quality has been identified as a significant factor affecting sustainable behaviour. Inefficient and low-quality public designs that do not consider living environments and specific lifestyles may fail to encourage community participation. This study aims to provide a more in-depth investigation into people\u2019s attitudes and actual behaviour towards and to shed light on public design for sustainability. Using the FWR programme in Amoy Gardens as a case, this study uses qualitative research methods to explore FWR experiences and improve its weaknesses. The findings show three potential challenges to FWR in densely populated high-rise buildings: (1) limited space, (2) hygiene issues and (3) implementation and management. This study also provides implications for public design to improve sustainability in communities and encourage public participation in FWR in high-density residential areas.","publish_time":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Jia Xin; Siu, Kin Wai Michael","journal":"Resour Conserv Recycl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d421a83b46ac36aadca9b259deadf3094ac889e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127662.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921344918300077; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288205/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344918300077","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Amoy Gardens"],"keyphrases":["FWR experiences","FWR programme","public participation","actual behaviour","food waste recycling","food waste issues","sustainability","sustainable behaviour","low-quality public designs","general coverage of study","environments","management","populated communities","in-depth perspective","recycling activities","various studies","in-depth investigation","community participation","hygiene issues","quantitative perspective","qualitative research methods","populated high-rise buildings","policy","economic incentives","norms","initiatives","people\u2019s attitudes","example","light","high-density residential areas","Amoy Gardens","potential challenges","limited space","recent decades","analysis","social culture","implications","specific lifestyles","significant factor","implementation","findings","Hong Kong","Physical setting quality","housing estates","matters","weaknesses","impacts of context","practical problems","cases","projects"],"language":"en"},

It causes impaired transit of intestinal contents and is determined by abnormalities of motor activity. The term CIP is used to indicate a heterogeneous group of disorders with many different pathogenic mechanisms. The defect in the regulation of intestinal transit can be at any level of motility control. Two main types of CIP are recognized, termed respectively myogenic (when smooth muscle cells are affected) and neurogenic (caused by abnormalities of extrinsic and/or intrinsic nervous supplies). Both types may be secondary to a variety of recognizable diseases or idiopathic. In myogenic CIP, intestinal transit is impaired because of lack of propulsive strength; in the neurogenic form, contractions are powerful but not sufficiently co-ordinated to propel intestinal contents aborally in an organized fashion. CIP belongs to the large and loosely defined group of digestive functional disorders. These disorders probably share common pathogenic mechanisms but with different expressiveness. The reasons why only some patients present recurrent symptomatological bouts resembling mechanical occlusion has not been clarified. This aspect is of great clinical relevance and deserves attention, as CIP patients, unlike other patients with severe functional disorders, may undergo repeated, useless and potentially dangerous operations. The diagnosis of CIP may be suggested by clinical features and is based on radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and histological findings. Recent technological improvements facilitate the recognition of this intriguing syndrome. In particular, manometric recording of the small bowel motility, which has long been considered an important research technique, can now also be regarded as a useful diagnostic tool.","publish_time":"1988-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanghellini, Vincenzo; Corinaldesi, Roberto; Barbara, Luigi","journal":"Bailli\u00E8re\u0027s Clinical Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0950352888900292; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0950352888900292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CIP patients","myogenic CIP","term CIP","diagnosis of CIP","regulation of intestinal transit","main types of CIP","impaired transit of intestinal contents","signs of intestinal occlusion","clinical syndrome","severe functional disorders","heterogeneous group of disorders","Abstract Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction","mechanical obstruction","mechanical occlusion","defined group of digestive functional disorders","different pathogenic mechanisms","manometric","clinical features","common pathogenic mechanisms","great clinical relevance","neurogenic form","different expressiveness","abnormalities of extrinsic","intriguing syndrome","small bowel motility","abnormalities of motor activity","level of motility control","recurrent symptomatological bouts","recognition","absence","attention","symptoms","variety of recognizable diseases","lack of propulsive strength","contractions","smooth muscle cells","Recent technological improvements","intrinsic nervous supplies","dangerous operations","histological findings","aspect","gut lumen","organized fashion","defect","important research technique","useful diagnostic tool","reasons"],"language":"en"},

Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC is of zoonotic origin and closely related to bat coronaviruses. The human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry point and primary target tissue for respiratory viruses and is highly relevant for assessing the zoonotic potential of emerging respiratory viruses, such as HCoV-EMC. Here, we show that pseudostratified HAE cultures derived from different donors are highly permissive to HCoV-EMC infection, and by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and RNAseq data, we experimentally determined the identity of seven HCoV-EMC subgenomic mRNAs. Although the HAE cells were readily responsive to type I and type III interferon (IFN), we observed neither a pronounced inflammatory cytokine nor any detectable IFN responses following HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, or HCoV-229E infection, suggesting that innate immune evasion mechanisms and putative IFN antagonists of HCoV-EMC are operational in the new host. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that both type I and type III IFN can efficiently reduce HCoV-EMC replication in HAE cultures, providing a possible treatment option in cases of suspected HCoV-EMC infection.","publish_time":"2013-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kindler, Eveline; J\u00F3nsd\u00F3ttir, Hulda R.; Muth, Doreen; Hamming, Ole J.; Hartmann, Rune; Rodriguez, Regulo; Geffers, Robert; Fouchier, Ron A.

The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.","publish_time":"1989-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reinacher, M.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca2ecc30be77a0562af79ff1ae4faf13fe1d84d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165242789901323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165242789901323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FeLV-associated enteritis","persistent FeLV infections","feline infectious panleukopenia","non-neoplastic diseases","immunosuppressive effect of FeLV","persistent infection","feline infectious peritonitis","cats","certain pathogenic infectious agents","spectrum of neoplastic","feline leukemia virus","conditions","known association","strong association","bacterial secondary infections","respiratory tract inflammations","anemia","icterus","animals susceptible","glomerulonephritis","hemorrhages","uremia","liver degeneration","presence","addition","types","hemorrhagic cystitis","diagnosis","paraffin sections","unexpected finding","lymphoma disease complex","necropsy","order","quarters","immunosuppression","majority","tumors"],"language":"en"},

In exploratory Stage I we utilized high-throughput protein arrays to identify 35 high-interest proteins showing increased reactivity in patient subgroups compared to healthy controls. In validation Stage II we designed new arrays focusing on 25 of the proteins identified in Stage I and expanded the initial cohort. We validated increased antibody reactivity against AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B in patients, which enabled sample classification into stable MDS and healthy individuals. We also detected elevated AKT3 protein levels in MDS patient plasma.

Clinical studies have shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including carcinomas of the esophagus, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung, making the protein as a potential cancer biomarker. However, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined, and the signaling mechanisms that drive AGR2 to inhibit p53 are still not clearly illustrated. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop molecular probes specifically recognizing AGR2 for its detection and for the elucidation of AGR2-associated molecular mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through a bead-based and flow cytometry monitored SELEX technology, we have identified a group of DNA aptamers that can specifically bind to AGR2 with K(d) values in the nanomolar range after 14 rounds of selections. Aptamer C14B was chosen to further study, due to its high binding affinity and specificity. The optimized and shortened C14B1 has special G-rich characteristics, and the G-rich region of this binding motif was further characterized to reveal an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex by CD spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Our experiments confirmed that the stability of the G-quadruplex structure was strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ions and the formation of G-quadruplex structure was also important for the binding capacity of C14B1 to the target. Furthermore, we have designed a kind of allosteric molecule beacon (aMB) probe for selective and sensitive detection of AGR2. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we have developed new aptamer probes for specific recognition of the AGR2. Structural study have identified that the binding motif of aptamer is an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. Furthermore, with our design of AGR2-aMB, AGR2 could be sensitively and selectively detected. This aptamer probe has great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.","publish_time":"2012-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Jie; Wang, Chi; Li, Xilan; Song, Yanling; Wang, Wei; Li, Cong; Hu, Jia; Zhu, Zhi; Li, Jiuxing; Zhang, Weiyun; Lu, Zhongxian; Yang, Chaoyong James","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a015401a1cdf151bd0bca060bd8eb96d6683a147.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3460915.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3460915/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aptamer"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AGR2 protein","elucidation of AGR2","design of AGR2","sensitive detection of AGR2","general biochemical functions of AGR2","binding motif of aptamer","intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure","formation of G","G-rich region","binding capacity of C14B1","high binding affinity","special G-rich characteristics","Aptamer C14B","new aptamer probes","nanomolar range","prognosis of cancer","aMB","cancer progression","functional protein","potential cancer biomarker","nature","molecular probes","great potential","wide range of human cancers","diverse range of biological systems","CD spectroscopy","shortened C14B1","human cells","UV spectroscopy","monovalent ions","Structural study","molecular mechanism","vertebrate tissue development","inflammatory tissue injury responses","useful tool","critical roles","esophagus","early diagnosis","kind of allosteric molecule beacon","carcinomas","fundamental research","specific recognition","bead","flow cytometry","breast","prostate","pancreas","work","Anterior gradient homolog","values","stability","SELEX technology","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","lung","rounds of selections","mechanisms","target","specificity","group of DNA aptamers","Clinical studies","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSION","SIGNIFICANCE","p53","experiments"],"language":"en"},

We herein describe the emergence and epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in PICTs from 2009 to 2010. METHODS: The World Health Organization gathered reports of influenza-like-illness and laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases from all 23 Pacific island countries and territories, from April 2009 through August 2010. Data were gathered through weekly email reports from Pacific island countries and territories and through email or telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Pacific island countries and territories started detecting pandemic H1N1 cases in June 2009, firstly in French Polynesia, with the last new detection occurring in August 2009 in Tuvalu. Nineteen Pacific island countries and territories reported 1,972 confirmed cases, peaking in August 2009. No confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were identified in Niue, Pitcairn and Tokelau; the latter instituted strict maritime quarantine. Influenza-like-illness surveillance showed trends similar to surveillance of confirmed cases. Seven Pacific island countries and territories reported 21 deaths of confirmed pandemic H1N1. Case-patients died of acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, or both. The most reported pre-existing conditions were obesity, lung disease, heart disease, and pregnancy. Pacific island countries and territories instituted a variety of mitigation measures, including arrival health screening. Multiple partners facilitated influenza preparedness planning and outbreak response. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza spread rapidly throughout the Pacific despite enormous distances and relative isolation. Tokelau and Pitcairn may be the only jurisdictions to have remained pandemic-free. Despite being well-prepared, Pacific island countries and territories experienced significant morbidity and mortality, consistent with other indigenous and low-resource settings. For the first time, regional influenza-like-illness surveillance was conducted in the Pacific, allowing health authorities to monitor the pandemic\u2019s spread and severity in real-time. Future regional outbreak responses will likely benefit from the lessons learned during this outbreak.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kool, Jacobus Leen; Pavlin, Boris Igor; Musto, Jennie; Dawainavesi, Akanisi","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8025fd0081c92f0cdd9d271c8a70ea7578217fda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3545879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pitcairn"],"locations":["Pacific"],"keyphrases":["Pacific island countries","territories","confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases","reports of influenza","regional influenza","deaths of confirmed pandemic H1N1","surveillance of confirmed cases","epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic influenza H1N1","pandemic-free","influenza pandemics","illness surveillance","influenza preparedness planning","health authorities","World Health Organization","PICTs","Tokelau","Pitcairn","Future regional outbreak responses","weekly email reports","arrival health screening","reported pre-existing conditions","lung disease","heart disease","pandemic\u2019s spread","instituted strict maritime quarantine","acute respiratory distress syndrome","obesity","significant morbidity","variety of mitigation measures","multi-organ failure","trends similar","mortality","Niue","laboratory","Multiple partners","Case-patients","enormous distances","relative isolation","emergence","RESULTS","low-resource settings","new detection","severity","pregnancy","Data","METHODS","jurisdictions","telephone follow-up","BACKGROUND","French Polynesia","lessons","CONCLUSIONS","Tuvalu"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we developed a new method for the discovery of unknown viruses based on the cDNA - random amplified polymorphic DNA (cDNA-RAPD) technique. Getah virus, belonging to the family Togaviridae in the genus Alphavirus, is a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus that was identified using the Virus-Discovery-cDNA RAPD (VIDISCR) method. RESULTS: A novel Getah virus was identified by VIDISCR from suckling mice exposed to mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) collected in Yunnan Province, China. The non-structural protein gene, nsP3, the structural protein gene, the capsid protein gene, and the 3\u0027-untranslated region (UTR) of the novel Getah virus isolate were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence identities of each gene were determined to be 97.1\u201399.3%, 94.9\u201399.4%, and 93.6\u201399.9%, respectively, when compared with the genomes of 10 other representative strains of Getah virus.

The objective of this work was to study the acute phase proteins (APP) responses after coinfection of piglets with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SwH1N1) and Pasteurella multocida (Pm) in order to identify whether the individual APP response correlate with disease severity and whether APP could be used as markers of the health status of coinfected pigs. RESULTS: In all coinfected pigs clinical sings, including fever, coughing and dyspnea, were seen. Viral shedding was observed from 2 to 7 dpi. The mean level of antibodies against Pm dermonecrotoxin in infected piglets increase significantly from 7 dpi. Anti-SwH1N1 antibodies in the serum were detected from 7 dpi. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) increased significantly at 1 dpi as compared to control pigs, and remained significantly higher to 3 dpi. Level of serum amyloid A (SAA) was significantly higher from 2 to 3 dpi. Haptoglobin (Hp) was significantly elevated from 3 dpi to the end of study, while pig major acute phase protein (Pig-MAP) from 3 to 7 dpi. The concentrations of CRP, Hp and SAA significantly increased before specific antibodies were detected. Positive correlations were found between serum concentration of Hp and SAA and lung scores, and between clinical score and concentrations of Pig-MAP and SAA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of current study confirmed that monitoring of APP may revealed ongoing infection, and in this way may be useful in selecting clinically healthy pigs (i.e. before integration into an uninfected herd). Present results corroborated our previous findings that SAA could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies (e.g. vaccine efficiency investigations) or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity (lung scores, clinical scores).","publish_time":"2013-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pomorska-M\u00F3l, Ma\u0142gorzata; Markowska-Daniel, Iwona; Kwit, Krzysztof; St\u0119pniewska, Katarzyna; Pejsak, Zygmunt","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21083480591a0f89c6c6a1ee575c79ef9eeaeb75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3554491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pasteurella"],"organizations":["APP","SAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SAA","disease severity","acute respiratory disease","serum concentration of Hp","H1N1 swine influenza virus","clinical scores","monitoring of APP","lung scores","coinfected pigs clinical sings","Pig-MAP","concentrations of Pig","healthy pigs","control pigs","acute phase proteins","acute onset of fever","frequent complications of influenza","Level of serum amyloid","results of current study","major acute phase protein","concentration of C","Anti-SwH1N1 antibodies","health status of coinfected pigs","mean level of antibodies","Present results","specific antibodies","concentrations of CRP","end of study","individual APP response correlate","coinfection of piglets","Pm dermonecrotoxin","ongoing infection","infected piglets","respiratory symptoms","useful indicator","reactive protein","experimental infection studies","responses","Pasteurella multocida","vaccine efficiency investigations","order","secondary bacterial pneumonia","integration","markers","previous findings","way","work","CONCLUSIONS","Positive correlations","BACKGROUND","SIV","uninfected herd","Viral shedding","objective","dyspnea","Haptoglobin"],"language":"en"},

We present a novel methodology using locally generated data for estimating this burden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This method begins with calculating the hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence for children \u003C5 years old and persons \u22655 years old from population-based surveillance in one province. This base rate of SARI is then adjusted for each province based on the prevalence of risk factors and healthcare-seeking behavior. The percentage of SARI with influenza virus detected is determined from provincial-level sentinel surveillance and applied to the adjusted provincial rates of hospitalized SARI. Healthcare-seeking data from healthcare utilization surveys is used to estimate non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI. Rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI are applied to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The method was field-tested in Kenya, and validated in Guatemala, using data from August 2009\u2013July 2011. In Kenya (2009 population 38.6 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI cases ranged from 17,129\u201327,659 for children \u003C5 years old (2.9\u20134.7 per 1,000 persons) and 6,882\u20137,836 for persons \u22655 years old (0.21\u20130.24 per 1,000 persons), depending on year and base rate used. In Guatemala (2011 population 14.7 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized cases of influenza-associated pneumonia ranged from 1,065\u20132,259 (0.5\u20131.0 per 1,000 persons) among children \u003C5 years old and 779\u20132,252 cases (0.1\u20130.2 per 1,000 persons) for persons \u22655 years old, depending on year and base rate used. In both countries, the number of non-hospitalized influenza-associated cases was several-fold higher than the hospitalized cases. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus was associated with a substantial amount of severe disease in Kenya and Guatemala. This method can be performed in most low and lower-middle income countries.","publish_time":"2013-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuller, James A.; Summers, Aimee; Katz, Mark A.; Lindblade, Kim A.; Njuguna, Henry; Arvelo, Wences; Khagayi, Sammy; Emukule, Gideon; Linares-Perez, Nivaldo; McCracken, John; Nokes, D.

In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8(\u002B) T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1(\u002B), Tim-3(\u002B), CD122(\u002B)). CD8(\u002B) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(\u002B) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(\u002B) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) V\u03B2 chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or V\u03B2 14. Although V\u03B28(\u002B) CD8(\u002B) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of V\u03B28(\u002B) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-\u03B3 secreting profiles.

These radiation-protective agents, however, have many adverse effects. Efforts have been made to develop new radiation-protective agents for medical application. Here, we investigated whether a compound, polyethylenimine (PEI), which activates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-mediated NF-kB signaling pathways, could have an anti-radiation effect on a mouse model. First, a cell-based screening model for an agonist of TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway was established and then validated by activation of TLR5-mediated NF-kB luciferase reporter activity with a known TLR5 agonist, flagellin. We found that PEI induced dose-dependent activation of the TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway, indicating that PEI is indeed a TLR5 agonist. Furthermore, the anti-radiation effect of polyethylenimine was assessed using a \u03B3-ray total body irradiation (TBI) mouse model. Compared with the irradiation control, both survival time and survival rate were significantly improved in mice that received either a low dose of polyethylenimine (P= 0.019) or a high dose of polyethylenimine (P\u003C 0.001). We also observed a positive correlation between animal body weight and survival time in mice that received a low dose of polyethylenimine, a high dose of polyethylenimine and amifostine, over a period of 30 days, r= 0.42 (P\u003C 0.02), 0.72 (P\u003C 0.0001) and 0.95 (P\u003C 0.0001), respectively, while a negative correlation between animal body weight and survival time was observed in the irradiation control (r= \u20130.89; P\u003C 0.0001). These results indicate that polyethylenimine is a new TLR5 agonist with potential application in offering protection for patients receiving radiotherapy or in radiation-related accidents.","publish_time":"2012-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Zhiqiang; Xing, Yaling; Qian, Yuanyu; Chen, Xiaojuan; Tu, Jian; Ren, Lening; Wang, Kai; Chen, Zhongbin","journal":"J Radiat Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ea10ee40e0ecf02db0667f87ed9ee4e2bd6aa9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3589936.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589936/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PEI"],"organizations":["Toll-like"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agonist of TLR5","TLR5-mediated NF","high dose of polyethylenimine","low dose of polyethylenimine","activation of TLR5","new TLR5 agonist","anti-radiation effect of polyethylenimine","known TLR5 agonist","survival time","ionizing radiation","new radiation-protective agents","radiation-related accidents","survival rate","mouse model","irradiation control","animal body weight","PEI induced dose-dependent activation","mice","number of agents","\u03B3-ray total body irradiation","potential application","medical application","positive correlation","negative correlation","cell-based screening model","luciferase reporter activity","TBI","radiotherapy","protection","patients","period","amifostine","pathways","days","Toll","receptor","flagellin","results","compound","adverse effects","Efforts"],"language":"en"},

Cholera vaccines not only provide health benefits to susceptible populations but also have effects on the earning capabilities and financial stability of the family. Community-based research and evaluations are necessary to understand perceptions about and practices of the community relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccines. This may help identify the ways in which such vaccines may be successfully introduced, and other preventive measures can be implemented. The present study assessed the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among an urban population residing in a high cholera-prone setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an area of high cholera prevalence in 15 randomly-selected clusters in Mirpur, Dhaka city. A study team collected data through a survey and in-depth interviews during December 2010\u2013February 2011. RESULTS: Of 2,830 families included in the final analysis, 23% could recognize cholera as acute watery diarrhea and 16% had ever heard of oral cholera vaccine. About 54% of the respondents had poor knowledge about cholera-related issues while 97% had a positive attitude toward cholera and oral cholera vaccine. One-third showed poor practice relating to the prevention of cholera. The findings showed a significant (p \u003C 0.05) association between the respondents\u2019 knowledge and sex, education, occupation, monthly overall household expenditure, attitudes and practice. In the adjusted model, male sex, having a lower monthly overall household expenditure, and having a less positive attitude toward cholera were the significant predictors to having poor knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the strengthening of health education activities to improve knowledge on cholera, its prevention and treatment and information on cholera vaccination among high-risk populations. The data also underscore the potential of mass cholera vaccination to prevent and control cholera.","publish_time":"2013-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahed, Tasnuva; Kaukab, Sheikh Shah Tanvir; Saha, Nirod Chandra; Khan, Iqbal Ansary; Khanam, Farhana; Chowdhury, Fahima; Saha, Amit; Khan, Ashraful Islam; Siddik, Ashraf Uddin; Cravioto, Alejandro; Qadri, Firdausi; Uddin, Jasim","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00951716e01c8e0cc341770389fc38d1b5455210.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3608226.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608226/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh","Dhaka"],"keyphrases":["prevention of cholera","consequences of cholera","control cholera","oral cholera vaccines","cholera-related issues","area of high cholera prevalence","high cholera-prone setting","potential of mass cholera vaccination","poor knowledge","respondents\u2019 knowledge","poor practice","attitudes","positive attitude","data","Bangladesh","preventive practices","families","cross-sectional study","study team","findings","present study","lower monthly overall household expenditure","male sex","strengthening of health education activities","financial stability","health benefits","significant predictors","Dhaka city","susceptible populations","high-risk populations","preventive measures","Community-based research","occupation","information","urban population","selected clusters","social burden","evaluations","effects","patients","survey","association","treatment","earning capabilities","endemic countries","Mirpur","perceptions","in-depth interviews","family","adjusted model","acute watery diarrhea","final analysis","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS","ways"],"language":"en"},

However, its undesirable responses of TNF-\u03B1 on activating NF-\u03BAB signaling and pro-metastatic property limit its clinical application in treating cancers. Therefore, sensitizing agents capable of overcoming this undesirable effect must be valuable for facilitating the usage of TNF-\u03B1-mediated apoptosis therapy for cancer patients. Previously, saikosaponin-d (Ssd), a triterpene saponin derived from the medicinal plant, Bupleurum falcatum L. (Umbelliferae), showed to exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities such as antiinflammation, antibacteria, antivirus and anticancer. Recently, we found that Ssd could inhibit the activated T lymphocytes via suppression of NF-\u03BAB, NF-AT and AP-1 signaling. Here, we showed that Ssd significantly potentiated TNF-\u03B1-mediated cell death in HeLa and HepG2 cancer cells via suppression of TNF-\u03B1-induced NF-\u03BAB activation and its target genes expression involving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and survival. Also, Ssd revealed a significant potency of abolishing TNF-\u03B1-induced cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis in HUVECs while inducing apoptosis via enhancing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Ssd has a significant potential to be developed as a combined adjuvant remedy with TNF-\u03B1 for cancer patients.","publish_time":"2013-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Vincent Kam Wai; Zhang, Molly Miao; Zhou, Hua; Lam, Kelly Yin Ching; Chan, Po Ling; Law, Carmen Ka Man; Yue, Patrick Ying Kit; Liu, Liang","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/190bc9d8aadbfb5c848ccdb9f4fa98610780ba56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3610377.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["HeLa"],"keyphrases":["potentiated TNF-\u03B1","Ssd","suppression of TNF","usage of TNF","significant potency of abolishing TNF-\u03B1","cancer patients","\u03B1-induced NF-\u03BAB activation","undesirable responses of TNF","\u03B1-mediated apoptosis therapy","cancer cell proliferation","induced cancer cell invasion","HepG2 cancer cells","suppression of NF","activating NF-\u03BAB","HeLa cells","mediated cell death","angiogenesis","undesirable effect","array of tumor cells","anticancer therapy","significant potential","cytotoxic effect","loss of mitochondrial membrane potential","Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","target genes expression","antiinflammation","pro-metastatic property","medicinal plant","activated T lymphocytes","clinical application","antibacteria","HUVECs","triterpene saponin","combined adjuvant remedy","Bupleurum falcatum","variety of pharmacological activities","sensitizing agents capable","Umbelliferae","antivirus","survival","saikosaponin-d","cancers","findings"],"language":"en"},

MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is attenuated in the M- and L-segments, but the S-segment retains the virulent phenotype. MP-12 was manufactured as an Investigational New Drug vaccine by using MRC-5 cells and encodes a functional NSs gene, the major virulence factor of RVFV which 1) induces a shutoff of the host transcription, 2) inhibits interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 promoter activation, and 3) promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). MP-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although MP-12 lacking NSs works for DIVA, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, while the use of type-I IFN-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability. To generate modified MP-12 vaccine candidates encoding a DIVA marker, while still replicating efficiently in MRC-5 cells, we generated recombinant MP-12 encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs. We have demonstrated that those recombinant MP-12 viruses inhibit IFN-\u03B2 mRNA synthesis, yet do not promote the degradation of PKR. The rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicated more efficiently than recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs in MRC-5 cells. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with MP-12, and were efficiently protected from wild-type RVFV challenge. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-RVFV NSs antibody and are therefore applicable to DIVA. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is highly efficacious, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, and encodes a DIVA marker, all of which are important for vaccine development for Rift Valley fever.","publish_time":"2013-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lihoradova, Olga A.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Head, Jennifer A.; Gong, Bin; Tigabu, Bersabeh; Juelich, Terry L.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Ikegami, Tetsuro","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d9f6bae2b7ced5834b4e92e7ef805d85fdea405.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3630143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rMP12-PTNSs","rMP12-SFSNSs","recombinant MP","place of MP","modified MP","lacking NSs","DIVA marker","IFN-incompetent cells","IFN-competent MRC","anti-RVFV NSs antibody","Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs","functional NSs gene","Rift Valley fever virus","hemorrhagic fever","vaccine development","vaccine candidates","encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs","wild-type RVFV challenge","IFN-\u03B2 mRNA synthesis","live-attenuated candidate vaccine","use of type","degradation of PKR","vaccinated animals","major virulence factor of RVFV","Investigational New Drug vaccine","antibodies cross-reactive","neutralizing antibodies","degradation of dsRNA","\u03B2 promoter activation","genus Phlebovirus","blindness","viruses","humans","dependent protein kinase","neurological disorders","family Bunyaviridae","interferon","differentiation of infected","level equivalent","S-segment","high rate of abortion","mosquito","zoonotic pathogen","virulent phenotype","ruminants","host transcription","shutoff","genetic stability","segments","Mice"],"language":"en"},

The pathogens of HFMD are mainly human enteroviruses (HEVs). Among them, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the most common pathogens of HFMD. However, other HEVs could also cause HFMD. To rapidly detect HEV71 and CVA16, and ensure detection of all HEVs causing HFMD, two real-time hybridization probe-based RT-PCR assays were developed in this study. One is a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, which was developed to detect and differentiate HEV71 specifically from CVA16 directly from clinical specimens within 1\u20132 h, and the other is a broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay, which targeted almost all HEVs. The experiments confirmed that the two assays have high sensitivity and specificity, and the sensitivity was up to 0.1 TCID(50)/ml for detection of HEVs, HEV71, and CVA16, respectively. A total of 213 clinical specimens were simultaneously detected by three kinds of assays, including the two real-time RT-PCR assays, direct conventional RT-PCR assay, and virus isolation assay on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). The total positive rate of both HEV71 and CVA16 was 69.48% with real-time RT-PCR assay, 47.42% with RT-PCR assay, and 34.58% with virus isolation assay. One HFMD clinical specimen was positive for HEV, but negative for HEV71 or CVA16, which was identified as Echovirus 11 (Echo11) by virus isolation, RT-PCR, and sequencing for the VP1 gene. The two real-time RT-PCR assays had been applied in 31 provincial HFMD labs to detect the pathogens of HFMD, which has contributed to the rapid identification of the pathogens in the early stages of HFMD outbreaks, and helped to clarify the etiologic agents of HFMD in China.","publish_time":"2013-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Aili; Xu, Changping; Tan, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Zhen; Mao, Naiying; Lu, Yiyu; Xu, Wenbo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d745e9cbecf81be30e9ffe290781acea84fbd9d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3630163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mouth Disease","HFMD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["real-time RT-PCR assays","multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay","broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay","CVA16","HEV71","direct conventional RT-PCR assay","common pathogens of HFMD","HFMD clinical specimen","real-time hybridization probe-based RT-PCR assays","virus isolation assay","provincial HFMD labs","etiologic agents of HFMD","early stages of HFMD outbreaks","detection of HEVs","kinds of assays","clinical specimens","human rhabdomyosarcoma cells","human enteroviruses","China","total positive rate","RD cells","high sensitivity","children deaths","Mouth Disease","Foot","specificity","sequencing","Echo11","Large-scale Hand","coxsackievirus A16","Echovirus","VP1 gene","rapid identification","year","study","TCID","experiments"],"language":"en"},

During high-multiplicity infection of cultured mammalian cells with Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV), NSs is rapidly degraded after reaching peak levels of expression at 12hpi. Through the use of inhibitors this was shown to be the result of proteasomal degradation. A recombinant virus (rBUN4KR), in which all four lysine residues in NSs were replaced by arginine residues, expresses an NSs protein (NSs4KR) that is resistant to degradation, confirming that degradation is lysine-dependent. However, despite repeated attempts, no direct ubiquitylation of NSs in infected cells could be demonstrated. This suggests that degradation of NSs, although lysine-dependent, may be achieved through an indirect mechanism. Infection of cultured mammalian cells or mice indicated no disadvantage for the virus in having a non-degradable NSs protein: in fact rBUN4KR had a slight growth advantage over wtBUNV in interferon-competent cells, presumably due to the increased and prolonged presence of NSs. In cultured mosquito cells there was no difference in growth between wild-type BUNV and rBUN4KR, but surprisingly NSs4KR was not stabilised compared to the wild-type NSs protein.","publish_time":"2013-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Knippenberg, Ingeborg; Fragkoudis, Rennos; Elliott, Richard M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c78286b1684b83d68551054909958005fc2529a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3648540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["degradation of NSs","wild-type NSs protein","direct ubiquitylation of NSs","NSs proteins of bunyaviruses","prolonged presence of NSs","non-degradable NSs protein","infected cells","cultured mosquito cells","interferon-competent cells","high-multiplicity infection of cultured mammalian cells","lysine residues","lysine-dependent","fact rBUN4KR","wild-type BUNV","NSs4KR","result of proteasomal degradation","arginine residues","recombinant virus","viral interferon antagonists","slight growth advantage","Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus","wtBUNV","difference","mice","host\u0027s antiviral response","disadvantage","repeated attempts","peak levels of expression","hpi","use of inhibitors","indirect mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.","publish_time":"2013-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatterjee, Dhriti; Biswas, Kaushiki; Nag, Soma; Ramachandra, S.

However, in immunocompromised patients, it can cause systemic infection accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and hepatitis. Although most of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) are immunologically compromised, they are usually not considered to be at risk for systemic VZV infection. We report two cases of systemic VZV infection occurring in critically ill patients in an ICU. One patient was a 69-year-old man with Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced purpurafulminans, and the other was a 75-year-old woman with severe acute pancreatitis. During the clinical course in the ICU, characteristic vesicles with umbilical fossa appeared diffusely and bilaterally on their face, trunk, and extremities. VZV-specific IgG levels were confirmed to be elevated compared to that of the pre-onset, and a diagnosis of recurrent VZV infection was made in both patients. The patients were treated at the same ICU but did not coincide with each other; therefore a cross-infection was unlikely. They were treated with intravenous acyclovir, but the latter patient eventually died of respiratory failure. VZV infection can cause a number of serious complications, and can lead to death in some patients. Early detection and proper treatment are needed to prevent the infection from spreading out and save the patients. It might be necessary to consider antiviral prophylaxis against VZV infection for a part of critically ill patients in ICU, although the effectiveness of this approach is yet to be established.","publish_time":"2013-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagiya, Hideharu; Kimura, Maya; Miyamoto, Toru; Otsuka, Fumio","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33f082ce3f4048737a0e3d07a863487822cf3e93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3711847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3711847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VZV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systemic infection","ill patients","ICU","cases of systemic VZV infection","cross-infection","immunocompromised patients","diagnosis of recurrent VZV infection","VZV-specific IgG levels","year-old man","year-old woman","localized zoster","number of serious complications","Varicella-zoster virus","characteristic vesicles","Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced purpurafulminans","intensive care unit","severe acute pancreatitis","umbilical fossa","antiviral prophylaxis","proper treatment","clinical course","Early detection","encephalitis","effectiveness","risk","pre-onset","face","trunk","extremities","hepatitis","intravenous acyclovir","respiratory failure","adults","death","approach"],"language":"en"},

Movement control as determined by rotarod assay significantly worsened in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis -virus-infected SJL/J mice from 42 to 196 days after infection (dpi). In the spinal cords, inflammatory changes were detected 14 to 196 dpi, and demyelination progressively increased from 42 to 196 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed 1001 differentially expressed genes over the study period. The dominating changes as revealed by k-means and functional annotation clustering included up-regulations related to intrathecal antibody production and antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility class II molecules. A random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that down-regulated lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis and up-regulated toll-like receptor-4-induced pathways were intimately associated with demyelination as measured by immunohistology. Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination.","publish_time":"2009-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ulrich, Reiner; Kalkuhl, Arno; Deschl, Ulrich; Baumg\u00E4rtner, Wolfgang","journal":"J Cell Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7051169cee12dbca19764986a24af534e60c3ab4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3837619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Theiler"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic demyelination","regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis","inflammatory changes","regulation of toll","induced pathways","Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis -virus","regulated toll","main pathways","receptor","transcriptional changes","dominating changes","chronic progressive multiple sclerosis","regulated lipid","spinal cords","immunohistology approach","Microarray analysis","study period","inflammatory demyelinating disease","assumption-free combined microarray","presentation","antigen processing","pathological similarities","infected SJL","regulations","major histocompatibility class","intrathecal antibody production","rotarod assay","J mice","adaptive immune response","neurite morphogenesis","random forest machine learning algorithm","molecules","rate","step of myelination","days","functional annotation clustering","Movement control","inhibition of remyelination","infection","aim"],"language":"en"},

The recent emergence of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada is a good example of a complex health issue for which the public health sector must find protective interventions. Traditional preventive and control interventions can have important environmental, social and economic impacts and as a result, decision-making requires a systems approach capable of integrating these multiple aspects of interventions. This paper presents the results from a study of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for the management of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada. MCDA methods allow a comparison of interventions or alternatives based on multiple criteria. METHODS: MCDA models were developed to assess various prevention and control decision criteria pertinent to a comprehensive management of Lyme disease: a first model was developed for surveillance interventions and a second was developed for control interventions. Multi-criteria analyses were conducted under two epidemiological scenarios: a disease emergence scenario and an epidemic scenario. RESULTS: In general, we observed a good level of agreement between stakeholders. For the surveillance model, the three preferred interventions were: active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging, active surveillance of vectors by trapping of small rodents and passive surveillance of vectors of human origin. For the control interventions model, basic preventive communications, human vaccination and small scale landscaping were the three preferred interventions. Scenarios were found to only have a small effect on the group ranking of interventions in the control model. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA was used to structure key decision criteria and capture the complexity of Lyme disease management. This facilitated the identification of gaps in the scientific literature and enabled a clear identification of complementary interventions that could be used to improve the relevance and acceptability of proposed prevention and control strategy. Overall, MCDA presents itself as an interesting systematic approach for public health planning and zoonoses management with a \u201COne Health\u201D perspective.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aenishaenslin, C\u00E9cile; Hongoh, Val\u00E9rie; Ciss\u00E9, Hassane Djibrilla; Hoen, Anne Gatewood; Samoura, Karim; Michel, Pascal; Waaub, Jean-Philippe; B\u00E9langer, Denise","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d83e408bb99c9fba6e3fdbe6c51ee596ed9d2c97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3850527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3850527/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zoonoses"],"organizations":["MCDA"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["surveillance interventions","control interventions model","preferred interventions","protective interventions","comparison of interventions","control model","multiple aspects of interventions","surveillance model","comprehensive management of Lyme disease","complexity of Lyme disease management","effective disease management","control decision criteria pertinent","clear identification of complementary interventions","zoonoses management","multiple criteria","control strategy","MCDA methods","disease emergence scenario","active surveillance of vectors","recent emergence of Lyme disease","multi-criteria decision analysis","key decision criteria","Multi-criteria analyses","passive surveillance of vectors","MCDA models","public health planning","public health sector","human vaccination","complex health issue","human-animal","human origin","Quebec","small rodents","small effect","Canada","results","small scale landscaping","interesting systematic approach","multi-sectoral approaches","various prevention","good example","epidemic scenario","identification of gaps","epidemiological scenarios","basic preventive communications","acceptability of proposed prevention","good level of agreement","order","study","economic impacts","scientific literature","growing international threat","environment interface","decision-making","systems","alternatives","group","second","stakeholders","BACKGROUND","relevance","paper","perspective","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

VacA induces apoptotic cell death, which is potentiated by ammonia. VacA also causes cell death by mitochondrial damage, via signaling pathways that are not fully defined. Our aim was to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. We found that C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key signaling protein of ER stress-induced apoptosis, was transcriptionally up-regulated following incubation of gastric epithelial cells with VacA. The effect of VacA on CHOP induction was significantly enhanced by co-incubation with ammonium chloride. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)-alpha, which is known to occur downstream of the ER stress sensor PKR-like ER-localized eIF2-alpha kinase (PERK) and to regulate CHOP expression, was also observed following incubation with VacA in the presence of ammonium chloride. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA resulted in inhibition of VacA-induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that silencing of the PERK gene with siRNA attenuated VacA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha, CHOP induction, expression of BH3-only protein Bim and Bax activation, and cell death induced by VacA with ammonium chloride, indicating that ER stress may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction during VacA-induced toxicity. Activation of ER stress and up-regulation of BH3-only proteins were also observed in human H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa. Collectively, this study reveals a possible association between VacA-induced apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells, and activation of ER stress in H. pylori-positive gastric mucosa.","publish_time":"2013-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akazawa, Yuko; Isomoto, Hajime; Matsushima, Kayoko; Kanda, Tsutomu; Minami, Hitomi; Yamaghchi, Naoyuki; Taura, Naota; Shiozawa, Ken; Ohnita, Ken; Takeshima, Fuminao; Nakano, Masayuki; Moss, Joel; Hirayama, Toshiya; Nakao, Kazuhiko","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ee2232fd9b2088955ad781243f135dc76edbaf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3862672.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3862672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["H. pylori"],"organizations":["CHOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VacA-induced apoptosis","inhibition of VacA","effect of VacA","VacA-induced toxicity","Activation of ER stress","protein of ER stress-induced apoptosis","ER stress sensor PKR","siRNA attenuated VacA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2","CHOP induction","CHOP expression","ER-localized eIF2-alpha kinase","Knockdown of CHOP","following incubation of gastric epithelial cells","mitochondrial dysfunction","pylori-positive gastric mucosa","pylori-infected gastric mucosa","apoptotic cell death","presence of ammonium chloride","protein Bim","Bax activation","expression of BH3","mitochondrial damage","co-incubation","EBP homologous protein","PERK gene","regulation of BH3","Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor","possible association","key","silencing","endoplasmic reticulum","important virulence factors","proteins","study","aim","studies","pathways","Vacuolating cytotoxin","ammonia"],"language":"en"},

Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from humans with HIV-1 infection exhibit such activity but vaccine immunogens based on structures containing their epitopes have not been successful for their elicitation. All known broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnmAbs) are immunoglobulin (Ig) Gs (IgGs) and highly somatically hypermutated which could impede their elicitation. Ig Ms (IgMs) are on average significantly less divergent from germline antibodies and are relevant for the development of vaccine immunogens but are underexplored compared to IgGs. Here we describe the identification and characterization of several human IgM-derived mAbs against HIV-1 which were selected from a large phage-displayed naive human antibody library constructed from blood, lymph nodes and spleens of 59 healthy donors. These antibodies bound with high affinity to recombinant envelope glycoproteins (gp140s, Envs) of HIV-1 isolates from different clades. They enhanced or did not neutralize infection by some of the HIV-1 primary isolates using CCR5 as a coreceptor but neutralized all CXCR4 isolates tested although weakly. One of these antibodies with relatively low degree of somatic hypermutation was more extensively characterized. It bound to a highly conserved region partially overlapping with the coreceptor binding site and close to but not overlapping with the CD4 binding site. These results suggest the existence of conserved structures that could direct the immune response to non-neutralizing or even enhancing antibodies which may represent a strategy used by the virus to escape neutralizing immune responses. Further studies will show whether such a strategy plays a role in HIV infection of humans, how important that role could be, and what the mechanisms of infection enhancement are. The newly identified mAbs could be used as reagents to further characterize conserved non-neutralizing, weakly neutralizing or enhancing epitopes and modify or remove them from candidate vaccine immunogens.","publish_time":"2010-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Weizao; Zhu, Zhongyu; Liao, Huaxin; Quinnan, Gerald V.; Broder, Christopher C.; Haynes, Barton F.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b470eec84fd5bb0a9a7079506df05c3cdf398832.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3133461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzMz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralizing mAbs","Elicitation of antibodies","weakly neutralizing","HIV infection of humans","conserved non-neutralizing","germline antibodies","monoclonal antibodies","broad neutralizing activity","neutralizing immune responses","identified mAbs","development of vaccine immunogens","candidate vaccine immunogens","human IgM-derived mAbs","existence of conserved structures","primary isolates","coreceptor binding site","CXCR4 isolates","conserved region","role","strategy","epitopes","mechanisms of infection enhancement","CD4 binding site","Ig Ms","naive human antibody library","blood","recombinant envelope glycoproteins","lymph nodes","gp140s","Envs","high affinity","spleens","average","immunoglobulin","immunization","reagents","large phage","characterization","virus","CCR5","bnmAbs","low degree of somatic hypermutation","healthy donors","IgMs","identification","results","different clades","Gs","challenge","studies"],"language":"en"},

Efforts are underway to prepare effective subunit vaccines and therapies including antiviral antibodies. However, current vaccine efforts are hampered by the lack of information on protective immune responses against HCMV. Characterizing the B-cell response in healthy infected individuals could aid in the design of optimal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. To address this problem, we determined, for the first time, the B-cell repertoire against glycoprotein B (gB) of HCMV in different healthy HCMV seropositive individuals in an unbiased fashion. HCMV gB represents a dominant viral antigenic determinant for induction of neutralizing antibodies during infection and is also a component in several experimental HCMV vaccines currently being tested in humans. Our findings have revealed that the vast majority (\u003E90%) of gB-specific antibodies secreted from B-cell clones do not have virus neutralizing activity. Most neutralizing antibodies were found to bind to epitopes not located within the previously characterized antigenic domains (AD) of gB. To map the target structures of these neutralizing antibodies, we generated a 3D model of HCMV gB and used it to identify surface exposed protein domains. Two protein domains were found to be targeted by the majority of neutralizing antibodies. Domain I, located between amino acids (aa) 133\u2013343 of gB and domain II, a discontinuous domain, built from residues 121\u2013132 and 344\u2013438.

Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H(1)N(1 )influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H(1)N(1 )with myocarditis in pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29 and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory manifestations of H(1)N(1 )influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H(1)N(1 )virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H(1)N(1 )influenza virus in pregnant women.

Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one would expect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPI networks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of \u201Cbiologically central (BC)\u201D genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drug-targeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its \u201Cspine\u201D that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.","publish_time":"2011-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milenkovi\u0107, Tijana; Memi\u0161evi\u0107, Vesna; Bonato, Anthony; Pr\u017Eulj, Nata\u0161a","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0acac75cb3d2c19abfe061a5b1530b1dbbc6922.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3162560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3162560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human PPI network","PPI network topology","network properties","different network parts","protein function","new network-based approaches","protein-protein interaction","dense extended network neighborhoods","role of protein pathways","context of PPI networks","TC role","protein products","BC genes of TC nodes","complex wirings of proteins","new centrality measure","biological function","new insight","new biology","different concepts of topological centrality","cellular processes","debate","key biological processes","dense regions","notion of domination","dominating sets","cellular signals","drug-targeted pathways","efficient communication","DSs","existing methods","significant enrichment","infectious diseases","rest","essential macromolecules of life","aging","cancer","study","attention","aggregations","spine","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We used the Delphi process with internal (RKI) and external experts and a metric-consensus approach to score pathogens according to ten three-tiered criteria. Additional experts were invited to weight each criterion, leading to the calculation of a median weight by which each score was multiplied. We ranked the pathogens according to the total weighted score and divided them into four priority groups. RESULTS: 127 pathogens were scored. Eighty-six experts participated in the weighting; \u201CCase fatality rate\u201D was rated as the most important criterion. Twenty-six pathogens were ranked in the highest priority group; among those were pathogens with internationally recognised importance (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, Neisseria meningitides), pathogens frequently causing large outbreaks (e.g., Campylobacter spp.), and nosocomial pathogens associated with antimicrobial resistance. Other pathogens in the highest priority group included Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Varicella zoster virus and Hantavirus. DISCUSSION: While several pathogens from the highest priority group already have a high profile in national and international health policy documents, high scores for other pathogens (e.g., Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory syncytial virus or Hantavirus) indicate a possible under-recognised importance within the current German public health framework. A process to strengthen respective surveillance systems and research has been started. The prioritization methodology has worked well; its modular structure makes it potentially useful for other settings.","publish_time":"2011-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balabanova, Yanina; Gilsdorf, Andreas; Buda, Silke; Burger, Reinhard; Eckmanns, Tim; G\u00E4rtner, Barbara; Gro\u00DF, Uwe; Haas, Walter; Hamouda, Osamah; H\u00FCbner, Johannes; J\u00E4nisch, Thomas; Kist, Manfred; Kramer, Michael H.; Ledig, Thomas; Mielke, Martin; Pulz, Matthias; Stark, Klaus; Suttorp, Norbert; Ulbrich, Uta; Wichmann, Ole; Krause, G\u00E9rard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54283f47537cca8cedd424a4097d258dc66a9e7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3186774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["score pathogens","infectious pathogens","nosocomial pathogens","Influenza virus","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","highest priority group","Hepatitis C virus","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","Varicella zoster virus","national surveillance","priority groups","German national public health institute","Helicobacter pylori","RKI","Hantavirus","external experts","Eighty-six experts","Additional experts","current German public health framework","possible under-recognised importance","total weighted score","international health policy documents","high profile","high scores","strategic priorities","Delphi process","epidemiological research","median weight","important criterion","respective surveillance systems","institute\u0027s mid-term strategic decisions","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Neisseria meningitides","metric-consensus approach","weighting","accordance","Campylobacter","large outbreaks","Case fatality rate","calculation","antimicrobial resistance","modular structure","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","prioritization methodology","tiered criteria","settings","RESULTS","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-\u03B1) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-\u03B1 has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-\u03B1, for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichind\u00E9 virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-\u03B1, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2011-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gowen, Brian B.; Ennis, Jane; Russell, Andrew; Sefing, Eric J.; Wong, Min-Hui; Turner, Jeffrey","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1df508d29e27cafd7a54a39bc2e087caa3a6bc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3200317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3200317/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cIFN-\u03B1","protective effect of DEF201","use of DEF201","DEF201 technology","viral replication","expression of cIFN","Intranasal administration of DEF201","single dosing of DEF201","viral infections","number of viral pathogens","lethal PICV challenge","h post-virus exposure","viral hemorrhagic fever","vector adenovirus","hamsters","Effective countermeasures","significant protective effect","replication-deficient adenovirus vector","lasting protective immunity","severe disease","post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection","treatment options","limited prophylaxis","frequency of administration","Pichind\u00E9 virus","biodefense applications","liver-associated disease","new medical countermeasures","priority biodefense Category","case-fatality rates","NIAID","great therapeutic value","Infectious Diseases","host defense","licensed protein","National Institutes of Allergy","utility","mortality","weeks","Recombinant consensus interferon alpha","broad clinical appeal","hospitalized individuals","half-life","mode","animals","control","broad-spectrum antiviral","costly production","arenaviruses","potential","issues","limitations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In Phase I of the study, a cross-sectional study, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings responded to a questionnaire about incidence and duration of common colds in the previous 12 months. In Phase II, air temperature, relative humidity and CO(2) concentration were measured for 24 hours in 238 dorm rooms in 13 buildings, during both summer and winter. Out-to indoor air flow rates at night were calculated based on measured CO(2) concentrations. RESULTS: In Phase I, 10% of college students reported an incidence of more than 6 common colds in the previous 12 months, and 15% reported that each infection usually lasted for more than 2 weeks. Students in 6-person dorm rooms were about 2 times as likely to have an incidence of common colds \u22656 times per year and a duration \u22652 weeks, compared to students in 3-person rooms. In Phase II, 90% of the measured dorm rooms had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than the Chinese standard of 8.3 L/s per person during the heating season. There was a dose-response relationship between out-to indoor air flow rate per person in dorm rooms and the proportion of occupants with annual common cold infections \u22656 times.

Ongoing advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS have revealed multiple therapeutic targets for gene-based approaches. Strategies to enhance or restore lung epithelial and/or endothelial cell function, to strengthen lung defense mechanisms against injury, to speed clearance of infection and to enhance the repair process following ALI/ARDS have all demonstrated promise in preclinical models. Despite three decades of gene therapy research, however, the clinical potential for gene-based approaches to lung diseases including ALI/ARDS remains to be realized. Multiple barriers to effective pulmonary gene therapy exist, including the pulmonary architecture, pulmonary defense mechanisms against inhaled particles, the immunogenicity of viral vectors and the poor transfection efficiency of nonviral delivery methods. Deficits remain in our knowledge regarding the optimal molecular targets for gene-based approaches.

Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. RESULTS: The results showed that under UK conditions an animal\u0027s hoof temperature varied from 10\u00B0C to 36\u00B0C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal\u0027s activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation.","publish_time":"2011-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gloster, John; Ebert, Katja; Gubbins, Simon; Bashiruddin, John; Paton, David J","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8634374755ffb73d5975fc60de99034da21bb37e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3235061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3235061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ambient temperature","temperature distributions","animal\u0027s hoof temperature","single threshold hoof temperature","ambient conditions","useful indicator of core body temperature","eye temperatures","coronary band temperatures","animal surface temperatures","UK conditions","RESULTS","various environmental conditions","hooves of normal animals","early stages of disease","modest predictive indicator of early FMD","animal\u0027s activity","development of FMD lesions","mouth disease virus","common site","abnormalities","foot","surrogate","particular course of action","number of disciplines","healthy cattle","study","images","extended period","variation","Thermal imagers","BACKGROUND","measurement","technique","work","CONCLUSIONS","time","evaluation"],"language":"en"},

By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series.

Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R(0), in the range 1.6\u20133. Estimates of R(0) are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15\u201330% of its mean value.

METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were inoculated with A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09), which was a 2009 H1N1 influenza variant with a G222D mutation in the hemagglutinin. Clinical symptoms were recorded every day. Lung injury was assessed by lung water content and histopathological observation. Arterial blood gas, leukocyte count in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and blood, virus titers, and cytokine levels in the lung were measured at various times post-inoculation. Mice infected with SD/09 virus showed typical ARDS symptoms characterized by 60% lethality on days 8\u201310 post-inoculation, highly edematous lungs, inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema, lung hemorrhage, progressive and severe hypoxemia, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) \u2013 or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1/S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","publish_time":"2012-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olmstead, Andrea D.; Knecht, Wolfgang; Lazarov, Ina; Dixit, Surjit B.; Jean, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a447f42b4f4ed16afea798513f8c1409ee2252fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3252376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","S1P inhibitors","S1P inhibition","viral infection","HCV lifecycle","host LDs","HCV-encoded proteins","host subtilisin","key host factor","potential host","novel regulator","S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor","small-molecule inhibitor of SKI","liver cancer","virus assembly","liver transplantation","liver steatosis","Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism","development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals","virus propagation","novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals","key enzymes of cholesterol","lipid droplets","pathogenesis","site","master regulators of lipid homeostasis","human Flaviviridae viruses","hepatitis C virus","Reduction of LD formation","master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways","LD marker","increasing number of human viruses","dramatic reduction","cellular enzymes","infected cells","hepatoma cells","major risk factor","adipose differentiation-related protein","proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins","favorable environment","therapeutic target","SREBPs","antiviral options","ADRP","application","abundance of neutral lipids","powerful approach","interaction","critical role","kexin-isozyme","fatty-acid biosynthesis","expression","current standard of care","results","identification","perilipin","inhibitory mechanism","cascade","protease","PF","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

A recombinant VSV lacking its own envelope (G) gene has been used to produce a pseudotype or recombinant VSV possessing the envelope proteins of heterologous viruses. These viruses possess a reporter gene instead of a VSV G gene in their genome, and therefore it is easy to evaluate their infectivity in the study of viral entry, including identification of viral receptors. Furthermore, advantage can be taken of a property of the pseudotype VSV, which is competence for single-round infection, in handling many different viruses that are either difficult to amplify in cultured cells or animals or that require specialized containment facilities.

Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the resource gaps, and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a \u201Cmild-to-moderate\u201D pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as \u201Cavoidable\u201D mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths.","publish_time":"2012-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudge, James W.; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Krumkamp, Ralf; Chavez, Irwin; Adisasmito, Wiku; Ngoc Chau, Pham; Phommasak, Bounlay; Putthasri, Weerasak; Shih, Chin-Shui; Stein, Mart; Timen, Aura; Touch, Sok; Reintjes, Ralf; Coker, Richard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e6d38b98619d0d315d728291e97acde6c0012e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3283680.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3283680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Asia","Cambodia","Indonesia","Jakarta","Thailand","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","result of resource gaps","Estimates of resource gaps","resource needs","resource types","resource capacities","potential mortalities","pandemic scenario","pandemic influenza scenario","territories","pandemic influenza preparedness","attributable mortalities","substantial mortalities","potential impact of resource mobilization","health system resource data","major cause of avoidable mortalities","pandemic mitigation operations","avoidable deaths","Effective mobilization of resources","human resources","Taiwan","FINDINGS","health system capacity","model parameters","wide variations","Southeast Asia","focus of considerable investment","mathematical transmission model","Cambodia","Jakarta","Bali","socio-economic conditions","transmissibility","Indonesia","Lao PDR","clinical severity","administrative boundaries","oseltamivir","hospital beds","disease burden","province level","Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators","Thailand","way","region","degrees","range of parameter values","CONCLUSIONS","important implications","Vietnam","territory","terms","BACKGROUND","results","geographic patterns","METHODS","poorer areas","countries"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined our two data sets of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) derived from a total of 2,219 Japanese subjects. First, we performed a GWAS by analyzing 653,519 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 833 POAG patients and 686 controls. As a result, five variants that passed the Bonferroni correction were identified in CDKN2B-AS1 on chromosome 9p21.3, which was already reported to be a significant locus in the Caucasian population. Moreover, we combined the data set with our previous GWAS data set derived from 411 POAG patients and 289 controls by the Mantel-Haenszel test, and all of the combined variants showed stronger association with POAG (P\u003C5.8\u00D710(\u221210)). We then subdivided the case groups into two subtypes based on the value of intraocular pressure (IOP)\u2014POAG with high IOP (high pressure glaucoma, HPG) and that with normal IOP (normal pressure glaucoma, NPG)\u2014and performed the GWAS using the two data sets, as the prevalence of NPG in Japanese is much higher than in Caucasians. The results suggested that the variants from the same CDKN2B-AS1 locus were likely to be significant for NPG patients. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we successfully identified POAG-associated variants in the CDKN2B-AS1 locus using a Japanese population, i.e., variants originally reported as being associated with the Caucasian population. Although we cannot rule out that the significance could be due to the differences in sample size between HPG and NPG, the variants could be associated specifically with the vulnerability of the optic nerve to IOP, which is useful for investigating the etiology of glaucoma.","publish_time":"2012-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakano, Masakazu; Ikeda, Yoko; Tokuda, Yuichi; Fuwa, Masahiro; Omi, Natsue; Ueno, Morio; Imai, Kojiro; Adachi, Hiroko; Kageyama, Masaaki; Mori, Kazuhiko; Kinoshita, Shigeru; Tashiro, Kei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa89440c172e206c9cdd2f77373ed2b4d1a6b975.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3299784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GWAS","POAG","NPG","HPG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["POAG-associated variants","POAG patients","combined variants","NPG patients","high pressure glaucoma","normal pressure glaucoma","high IOP","normal IOP","CDKN2B-AS1 locus","data sets","etiology of glaucoma","Japanese population","previous GWAS data set","prevalence of NPG","significant locus","Caucasian population","major type of glaucoma","HPG","primary open-angle glaucoma","controls","Japanese subjects","SIGNIFICANCE","value of intraocular pressure","stronger association","genome-wide association studies","genetic variation","SNPs","autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms","small portion","subtypes","differences","sample size","Mantel-Haenszel test","optic nerve","Bonferroni correction","date","vulnerability","chromosome 9p21","study","total","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODS","case groups","CONCLUSIONS","Caucasians","BACKGROUND","results"],"language":"en"},

CD4(\u002B) CD25(\u002B) Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs were expanded or depleted during the persistent phase of the CNS infection, and the consequences for the virus-specific immune response and the extent of persistent infection were analyzed.

Expansion of Tregs after intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of the superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody D665 inducing transient immunosuppression caused increased virus replication and spread in the CNS. In contrast, depletion of Tregs using diphtheria toxin (DT) in DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells)-mice induced an increase of virus-specific CD8(\u002B) effector T cells in the brain and caused a reduction of the persistent infection.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of both LAMP methods at 60\u00B0C was 300 copies of IS2404 and 30 copies of IS2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65\u00B0C. When purified DNA extracts were used, both the conventional LAMP and IS2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the pocket warmer LAMP detected 19 cases. Nine of 30 samples were positive by both the LAMP assays as well as IS2404 PCR when crude extracts of clinical specimens were used. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The LAMP method can be used as a simple and rapid test for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. However, obtaining purified DNA, as well as generating isothermal conditions, remains a major challenge for the use of the LAMP method under field conditions.

The aim of this study was to investigate CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5) genetic polymorphisms with regards to the susceptibility and outcome of KD. Methods. A total of 1045 subjects (381 KD patients and 664 controls) were enrolled to identify 4 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of CLEC5A (rs1285968, rs11770855, rs1285935, rs1285933) by using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in cases and controls, and genetic effects were evaluated by the chi-square test. Results. No significant associations were noted between the genotypes and allele frequency of the 4 CLEC5A tSNPs between controls and patients. In the patients, polymorphisms of CLEC5A showed no significant association with coronary artery lesion formation and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response. Conclusions. This study showed for the first time that polymorphisms of CLEC5A are not associated with susceptibility to KD, coronary artery lesion formation, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response in a Taiwanese population.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Ya-Ling; Chang, Wei-Pin; Hsu, Yu-Wen; Chen, Wei-Chiao; Yu, Hong-Ren; Liang, Chi-Di; Tsai, Yao-Ting; Huang, Ying-Hsien; Yang, Kuender D.; Kuo, Ho-Chang; Chang, Wei-Chiao","journal":"J Biomed Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ef3d0709843acf3358abcb4144c23478e817097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3318896.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polymorphisms of CLEC5A","CLEC5A tSNPs","genetic polymorphisms","KD patients","susceptibility","outcome of KD","controls","coronary artery lesion formation","coronary artery lesions","intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response","genetic effects","disease outcome","study","tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms","Previous genetic studies","immune response factors","significant associations","Kawasaki disease","C-type lectin domain family","certain candidate genes","rs1285933","cases","rs1285968","regards","Taiwanese population","systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology","genotypes","rs11770855","rs1285935","allele frequency","TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay","Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium","Host","subjects","time","chi-square test","total","aim","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

There is considerable genetic diversity among the sapoviruses, which are classified into different genogroups based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length capsid protein sequence. While several mammalian species, including humans, pigs, minks, and dogs, have been identified as animal hosts for sapoviruses, there were no reports of sapoviruses in bats in spite of their biological diversity. In this report, we present the results of a targeted surveillance study in different bat species in Hong Kong. Five of the 321 specimens from the bat species, Hipposideros pomona, were found to be positive for sapoviruses by RT-PCR. Complete or nearly full-length genome sequences of approximately 7.7 kb in length were obtained for three strains, which showed similar organization of the genome compared to other sapoviruses. Interestingly, they possess many genomic features atypical of most sapoviruses, like high G\u002BC content and minimal CpG suppression. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral proteins suggested that the bat sapovirus descended from an ancestral sapovirus lineage and is most closely related to the porcine sapoviruses. Codon usage analysis showed that the bat sapovirus genome has greater codon usage bias relative to other sapovirus genomes. In summary, we report the discovery and genomic characterization of the first bat calicivirus, which appears to have evolved under different conditions after early divergence from other sapovirus lineages.","publish_time":"2012-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tse, Herman; Chan, Wan-Mui; Li, Kenneth S.

A prominent family of ISGs is the interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit) genes comprising three members in mice, Ifit1/ISG56, Ifit2/ISG54 and Ifit3/ISG49. Intranasal infection with a low dose of VSV is not lethal to wild-type mice and all three Ifit genes are induced in the central nervous system of the infected mice. We tested their potential contributions to the observed protection of wild-type mice from VSV pathogenesis, by taking advantage of the newly generated knockout mice lacking either Ifit2 or Ifit1. We observed that in Ifit2 knockout (Ifit2 (\u2212/\u2212)) mice, intranasal VSV infection was uniformly lethal and death was preceded by neurological signs, such as ataxia and hind limb paralysis. In contrast, wild-type and Ifit1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice were highly protected and survived without developing such disease. However, when VSV was injected intracranially, virus replication and survival were not significantly different between wild-type and Ifit2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. When administered intranasally, VSV entered the central nervous system through the olfactory bulbs, where it replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit2 (\u2212/\u2212) mice and induced interferon-\u03B2. However, as the infection spread to other regions of the brain, VSV titers rose several hundred folds higher in Ifit2 (\u2212/\u2212) mice as compared to wild-type mice. This was not caused by a broadened cell tropism in the brains of Ifit2 (\u2212/\u2212) mice, where VSV still replicated selectively in neurons. Surprisingly, this advantage for VSV replication in the brains of Ifit2(\u2212/\u2212) mice was not observed in other organs, such as lung and liver.

No direct evidence indicates that these new viruses arose as a result of recombination between genotype C and D or a result of convergence. In this study, we search for evidence of intra-individual recombination in the family cluster cases with co-circulation of genotype C, D and C/D recombinants. We studied 68 individuals from 15 families with HBV infections in 2006, identified individuals with mixed HBV genotype co-infections by restriction fragment length polymorphism and proceeded with cloning and DNA sequencing. Recombination signals were detected by RDP3 software and confirmed by split phylogenetic trees. Families with mixed HBV genotype co-infections were resampled in 2007. Three of 15 families had individuals with different HBV genotype co-infections in 2006. One individual (Y2) had a triple infection of HBV genotype C, D and C/D recombinant in 2006, but only genotype D in 2007. Further clonal analysis of this patient indicated that the C/D recombinant was not identical to previously isolated CD1 or CD2, but many novel recombinants with C2, D1 and CD1 were simultaneously found. All parental strains could recombine with each other to form new recombinant in this patient. This indicates that the detectable mixed infection and recombination have a limited time window. Also, as the recombinant nature of HBV precludes the possibility of a simple phylogenetic taxonomy, a new standard may be required for classifying HBV sequences.","publish_time":"2012-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Bin; Wang, Zhanhui; Yang, Jie; Sun, Jian; Li, Hua; Tanaka, Yasuhito; Mizokami, Masashi; Hou, Jinlin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8894267c458259ec6e58acbfad98a82c84519711.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3366946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3366946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genotype D","HBV infections","D recombinants","mixed HBV genotype co-infections","triple infection of HBV genotype C","different HBV genotype co-infections","co-circulation of genotype C","HBV sequences","recombinant nature of HBV","new recombinant","individuals","result of recombination","families","Recombination signals","evidence of intra-individual recombination","detectable mixed infection","novel recombinants","new standard","new viruses","patient","isolated CD1","result of convergence","phylogenetic trees","direct evidence","simple phylogenetic taxonomy","family cluster cases","restriction fragment length polymorphism","possibility","cloning","CD2","RDP3 software","hepatitis B virus","C2","limited time window","Y2","western China","DNA sequencing","clonal analysis","parental strains","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IX\u03B1, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.","publish_time":"2003-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slebos, Dirk-Jan; Ryter, Stefan W; Choi, Augustine MK","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faaf1022ccfe93b032c5608097a53543ba24aedb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC193681.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC193681/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","HO-1/CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["key mediator of HO","transcriptional upregulation of HO","Heme oxygenase","conversion of heme","heme degradation","virtue of anti-inflammatory effects","physiological role","oxidative stress","pulmonary diseases","pulmonary medicine","anti-apoptotic effects","inducible stress protein","proinflammatory stimuli","limits tissue damage","ferrous iron","response","metabolites","reactive oxygen","bilirubin IX\u03B1","growth","exogenous exposure","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","cytoprotection","respect","allograft rejection","inflammation","cigarette smoking","hypoxia","number of cellular processes","importance","nitrogen species","carbon monoxide","emphasis","review","transplantation","rate","step","low concentrations","agents","function","addition","system","enzymatic reaction products","inflammatory states","administration","apoptosis","isozyme","mechanisms","implications"],"language":"en"},

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. RESULTS: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. CONCLUSION: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.","publish_time":"2003-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Tuen Wai; Turinici, Gabriel; Danchin, Antoine","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b68a553a7cbbea13472721cd1ad617d42b40c26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC222908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC222908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Guangdong","China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS precursor","model","disease spread","innocuous epidemic","recent spread","appropriate identification of SARS patients","future development","time","various regions","present outbreak","milder outbreak","existing data","superimposed epidemics","important consequences","implementation of precautionary measures","effective prophylactic measures","puzzling contagion behavior","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","world","Guangdong province","large reservoir","Hong Kong","rest of China","variants","limits","weather cools","new coronavirus","properties similar","tropism","monitoring system","standard Susceptible-Infected","SIR","causes","evolution","patterns","mutants","high percentage of persons","unrelated viruses","order","framework","landmarks","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","report","situation","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Many SARS patients suffer respiratory distress brought on by interstitial infiltration and frequently show peripheral blood lymphopenia and occasional leucopenia. One possible cause of this could be interstitial inflammation, following a localized host response. In this study, we therefore examine the immune response of SARS-CoV in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over the first 24 hours. METHODS: PBMCs from normal healthy donors were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV and the viral replication kinetics was studied by real-time quantitative assays. SARS-CoV specific gene expression changes were examined by high-density oligonucleotide array analysis. RESULTS: We observed that SARS-CoV was capable of infecting and replicating in PBMCs and the kinetics of viral replication was variable among the donors. SARS-CoV antibody binding assays indicated that SARS specific antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication. Array data showed monocyte-macrophage cell activation, coagulation pathway upregulation and cytokine production together with lung trafficking chemokines such as IL8 and IL17, possibly activated through the TLR9 signaling pathway; that mimicked clinical features of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of human blood mononuclear cells as a direct target of SARS-CoV in the model system described here provides a new insight into disease pathology and a tool for investigating the host response and mechanisms of pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2004-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Lisa FP; Hibberd, Martin L; Ooi, Eng-Eong; Tang, Kin-Fai; Neo, Soek-Ying; Tan, Jenny; Krishna Murthy, Karuturi R; Vega, Vinsensius B; Chia, Jer-Ming; Liu, Edison T; Ren, Ee-Chee","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45d2d838cb3d5ae2dabd7bb7c82329b398d1c65f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC518965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC518965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV viral replication","SARS patients","immune response of SARS","SARS-CoV antibody binding assays","SARS specific antibodies","direct target of SARS","SARS-CoV specific gene expression changes","PBMCs","viral replication kinetics","kinetics of viral replication","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","identification of human blood mononuclear cells","peripheral blood lymphopenia","localized host response","disease pathology","respiratory distress","interstitial infiltration","interstitial inflammation","Array data","coagulation pathway upregulation","real-time quantitative assays","normal healthy donors","high-density oligonucleotide array analysis","molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome","cytokine production","monocyte-macrophage cell activation","lung trafficking chemokines","coronavirus","new insight","tool","model system","IL17","IL8","METHODS","occasional leucopenia","variable","capable of infecting","clinical features","BACKGROUND","TLR9","mechanisms of pathogenesis","CONCLUSIONS","possible cause","study","hours","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

SARS and related coronaviruses and astroviruses all possess a motif at the 3\u2032 end of their RNA genomes, called the s2m, whose pathogenic importance is inferred from its rigorous sequence conservation in an otherwise rapidly mutable RNA genome. We find that this extreme conservation is clearly explained by the requirement to form a highly structured RNA whose unique tertiary structure includes a sharp 90\u00B0 kink of the helix axis and several novel longer-range tertiary interactions. The tertiary base interactions create a tunnel that runs perpendicular to the main helical axis whose interior is negatively charged and binds two magnesium ions. These unusual features likely form interaction surfaces with conserved host cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. Based on its conservation in viral pathogen genomes and its absence in the human genome, we suggest that these unusual structural features in the s2m RNA element are attractive targets for the design of anti-viral therapeutic agents. Structural genomics has sought to deduce protein function based on three-dimensional homology. Here we have extended this approach to RNA by proposing potential functions for a rigorously conserved set of RNA tertiary structural interactions that occur within the SARS RNA genome itself. Based on tertiary structural comparisons, we propose the s2m RNA binds one or more proteins possessing an oligomer-binding-like fold, and we suggest a possible mechanism for SARS viral RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis, both based upon observed s2m RNA macromolecular mimicry of a relevant ribosomal RNA fold.","publish_time":"2004-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robertson, Michael P; Igel, Haller; Baertsch, Robert; Haussler, David; Ares, Manuel; Scott, William G","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe60210f629f9953405917869332d549f39e5a1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC539059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA genomes","SARS RNA genome","structured RNA","s2m RNA element","mutable RNA genome","conserved set of RNA tertiary structural interactions","observed s2m RNA macromolecular mimicry","relevant ribosomal RNA fold","SARS viral RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis","SARS virus genome","tertiary structural comparisons","tertiary base interactions","unusual structural features","unique tertiary structure","novel longer-range tertiary interactions","Structural genomics","human genome","viral pathogen genomes","protein function","virus function","motif","extreme conservation","three-dimensional crystal structure","rigorous sequence conservation","conserved host cell components","unusual features likely form interaction surfaces","helix axis","three-dimensional homology","design of anti-viral therapeutic agents","main helical axis","reactive sites","attractive targets","stem-loop","possible mechanism","tunnel","potential functions","absence","kink","astroviruses","proteins","pathogenic importance","related coronaviruses","\u00C5 resolution","oligomer-binding","interior","approach","requirement","end","magnesium ions"],"language":"en"},

Often the outcome of apoptotic stimuli is dependent on apoptotic, proliferative and survival signaling mechanisms in the cell. Therefore we investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13 cells. Increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK, Akt and GSK3\u03B2 were detected from 24\u201396 hours post-infection, concomitant with RV-induced apoptotic signals.

In Escherichia coli the protein protects RNA and DNA against damage from methylating agents. 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are repaired by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form. Genes for AlkB homologues are widespread in nature, and Eukaryotes often have several genes coding for AlkB-like proteins. Similar domains have also been observed in certain plant viruses. The function of the viral domain is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be involved in protecting the virus against the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system found in plants. We wanted to do a phylogenomic mapping of viral AlkB-like domains as a basis for analysing functional aspects of these domains, because this could have some relevance for understanding possible alternative roles of AlkB homologues e.g. in Eukaryotes. RESULTS: Profile-based searches of protein sequence libraries showed that AlkB-like domains are found in at least 22 different single-stranded RNA positive-strand plant viruses, but mainly in a subgroup of the Flexiviridae family. Sequence analysis indicated that the AlkB domains probably are functionally conserved, and that they most likely have been integrated relatively recently into several viral genomes at geographically distinct locations. This pattern seems to be more consistent with increased environmental pressure, e.g. from methylating pesticides, than with interaction with the PTGS system. CONCLUSIONS: The AlkB domain found in viral genomes is most likely a conventional DNA/RNA repair domain that protects the viral RNA genome against methylating compounds from the environment.","publish_time":"2005-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bratlie, Marit S; Drabl\u00F8s, Finn","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83b05e8afa6cbe7a68170ee155f7eca37c91d51f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC544882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544882/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AlkB domains","viral domain","phylogenomic mapping of viral AlkB","viral genomes","viral RNA genome","Similar domains","RNA repair domain","possible alternative roles of AlkB homologues","methylating compounds","methylating pesticides","methylating agents","PTGS system","Eukaryotes","proteins","certain plant viruses","different single-stranded RNA positive-strand plant viruses","conventional DNA","Sequence analysis","genes coding","Profile-based searches of protein sequence libraries","post-transcriptional gene silencing","direct reversal","damage","increased environmental pressure","oxidative demethylation","interaction","nature","basis","functional aspects","Escherichia coli","methylcytosine","unmethylated form","RESULTS","relevance","subgroup","distinct locations","members","dependent oxygenase superfamily","Flexiviridae family","oxoglutarate","plants","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","methyladenine","pattern"],"language":"en"},

Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pain in other conditions. We hypothesized that mast cells play a role in the pain of chronic pancreatitis. We examined the association of pain with mast cells in autopsy specimens of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis. We explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type (WT) and mast cell deficient mice (MCDM). METHODS: Archival tissues with histological diagnoses of chronic pancreatitis were identified and clinical records reviewed for presence or absence of reported pain in humans. Mast cells were counted. The presence of pain was assessed using von Frey Filaments (VFF) to measure abdominal withdrawal responses in both WT and MCDM mice with and without chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. WT mice with chronic pancreatitis were significantly more sensitive as assessed by VFF pain testing of the abdomen when compared with MCDM. CONCLUSION: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis have an increased number of pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. MCDM are less sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the abdomen after induction of chronic pancreatitis as compared with WT.

In viruses, the recombination rate depends on the frequency of genetic exchange between different viral genomes within an infected host cell and on the frequency at which such co-infections occur. While the recombination rate has been recently evaluated in experimentally co-infected cell cultures for several viruses, direct quantification at the most biologically significant level, that of a host infection, is still lacking. This study fills this gap using the cauliflower mosaic virus as a model. We distributed four neutral markers along the viral genome, and co-inoculated host plants with marker-containing and wild-type viruses. The frequency of recombinant genomes was evaluated 21 d post-inoculation. On average, over 50% of viral genomes recovered after a single host infection were recombinants, clearly indicating that recombination is very frequent in this virus. Estimates of the recombination rate show that all regions of the genome are equally affected by this process. Assuming that ten viral replication cycles occurred during our experiment\u2014based on data on the timing of coat protein detection\u2014the per base and replication cycle recombination rate was on the order of 2 \u00D7 10(\u22125) to 4 \u00D7 10(\u22125).

The genome of SARS-CoV, not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus, encodes replicase and four major structural proteins and a number of non-structural proteins. Published studies suggest that some non-structural proteins may play important roles in the replication, virulence and pathogenesis of viruses. Among the potential SARS-CoV non-structural proteins, 3b protein (ORF4) is predicted encoding 154 amino acids, lacking significant similarities to any known proteins. Till now, there is no report about the function of 3b protein. In this study, 3b gene was linked with the EGFP tag at the C- terminus. Through cell cycle analysis, it was found that over-expression of 3b-EGFP protein in Vero, 293 and COS-7 cells could induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and that especially in COS-7 cells, expression of 3b-EGFP was able to induce the increase of sub-G1 phase from 24 h after transfection, which was most obvious at 48 h. The apoptosis induction of 3b fusion protein in COS-7 cells was further confirmed by double cell labeling with 7-AAD and Annexin V, the function of 3b protein inducing cell G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis may provide a new insight for further study on the mechanism of SARS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2005-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Xiaoling; Shan, Yajun; Zhao, Zhenhu; Chen, Jiapei; Cong, Yuwen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30e4b834f1684fcc9ba26d41316a44b90aa287a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1190220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1190220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["b protein","b-EGFP protein","b fusion protein","b gene","potential SARS-CoV non-structural proteins","number of non-structural proteins","cell G0","known proteins","COS","cell cycle arrest","parenchyma cells apoptosis","G1 arrest","double cell","genome of SARS","major structural proteins","cell cycle analysis","mechanism of SARS pathogenesis","apoptosis induction","EGFP tag","function","study","increase of sub-G1 phase","over-expression","characterized coronavirus","pathogenesis of viruses","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","immune organ","organs","replication","virulence","significant similarities","AAD","replicase","cause","important roles","life-threatening atypical pneumonia","lung","liver","transfection","new insight","ORF4","Vero","amino acids","Annexin V","C- terminus","necrosis","Published studies","report"],"language":"en"},

The selected scFvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for SARS-CoV N protein detection in ELISA, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Human scFv antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV can be easily isolated by selecting the ETH-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen. These in vitro selected human scFvs specifically recognize in ELISA and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in N protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations SARS-CoV particles in infected Vero cells.

Our health care system and, in particular, our critical care system were unprepared for this event, and as a result the impact that SARS had was worse than it could have been. Nonetheless, we were able to organize a response rapidly during the outbreak. By describing our successes and failures, we hope to help others to learn and avoid the problems we encountered as they develop their own disaster management plans in anticipation of similar future situations.","publish_time":"2005-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawryluck, Laura; Lapinsky, Stephen E; Stewart, Thomas E","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46eed3a4ec7612d74e9295fe57c982755948feae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1269424.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1269424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["health care systems","health care workers","critical care system","SARS outbreak disaster","Disaster management plans","Toronto critical care experience of coping","large influx","result of bioterrorism","large number of victims","strained hospital systems","influenza","severe acute respiratory syndrome","anticipation of similar future situations","hospitals","proper planning","potential","review","major traumatic events","impact","Infectious diseases","response","successes","failures","eventuality","problems"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a qualitative case study to describe participant perceptions of the communication of bed allocation decisions in an 18-bed university affiliated, medical-surgical critical care unit at Sunnybrook and Women\u0027s College Health Sciences Centre. Interviewed participants were 3 critical care physicians, 4 clinical fellows in critical care, 4 resource nurses, 4 \u0022end-users\u0022 (physicians who commonly referred patients to the unit), and 3 members of the administrative staff. Median bed occupancy during the study period (Jan-April 2003) was 18/18; daily admissions and discharges (median) were 3. We evaluated our description using the ethical framework \u0022accountability for reasonableness\u0022 (A4R) to identify opportunities for improvement. RESULTS: The critical care physician, resource nurse, critical care fellow and end-users (trauma team leader, surgeons, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists) functioned independently in unofficial \u0022parallel tracks\u0022 of bed allocation decision-making; this conflicted with the official designation of the critical care physician as the sole authority. Communication between key decision-makers was indirect and could exclude those affected by the decisions; notably, family members. Participants perceived a lack of publicity for bed allocation rationales. CONCLUSION: The publicity condition should be improved for critical care bed allocation decisions. Decision-making in the \u0022parallel tracks\u0022 we describe might be unavoidable within usual constraints of time, urgency and demand. Formal guidelines for direct communication between key participants in such circumstances would help to improve the fairness of these decisions.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Andrew B; Joglekar, Amit S; Gibson, Jennifer; Swota, Alissa H; Martin, Douglas K","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45654599b3a90fd3ecfb03ca55dee622a7565e94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1298296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1298296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical care bed allocation decisions","critical care physicians","critical care fellow","communication of bed allocation decisions","intensive care unit bed allocation decisions","bed allocation decision-making","bed allocation rationales","medical-surgical critical care unit","bed university","Median bed occupancy","direct communication","key participants","publicity condition of accountability","end-users","lack of publicity","Interviewed participants","parallel tracks","reasonableness","participant perceptions","resource nurses","study period","family members","perceptions of fair process","qualitative case study","key decision-makers","Sunnybrook","trauma team leader","impact","Women\u0027s College Health Sciences Centre","clinical fellows","neurosurgeons","usual constraints of time","Formal guidelines","official designation","urgency","anesthesiologists","A4R","ethical framework","circumstances","sole authority","referred patients","demand","daily admissions","discharges","description","RESULTS","opportunities","improvement","METHODS","administrative staff","fairness","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This paper reviews drug abuse in China, the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its association with injection drug use (IDU), and Chinese policies on illicit drug abuse and prevention of HIV/AIDS based on published literature and unpublished official data. As a major drug trans-shipment country with source drugs from the \u0022Golden Triangle\u0022 and \u0022Gold Crescent\u0022 areas in Asia, China has also become an increasingly important drug consuming market. About half of China\u0027s 1.14 million documented drug users inject, and many share needles. IDU has contributed to 42% of cumulatively reported HIV/AIDS cases thus far. Drug trafficking is illegal in China and can lead to the death penalty. The public security departments adopt \u0022zero tolerance\u0022 approach to drug use, which conflict with harm reduction policies of the public health departments. Past experience in China suggests that cracking down on drug smuggling and prohibiting drug use alone can not prevent or solve all illicit drug related problems in the era of globalization. In recent years, the central government has outlined a series of pragmatic policies to encourage harm reduction programs; meanwhile, some local governments have not fully mobilized to deal with drug abuse and HIV/AIDS problems seriously. Strengthening government leadership at both central and local levels; scaling up methadone substitution and needle exchange programs; making HIV voluntary counseling and testing available and affordable to both urban and rural drug users; and increasing utilization of outreach and nongovernmental organizations are offered as additional strategies to help cope with China\u0027s HIV and drug abuse problem.","publish_time":"2006-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Han-Zhu; Schumacher, Joseph E; Chen, Huey T; Ruan, Yu-Hua","journal":"Harm Reduct J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cafb8587a42557c4f96ed28b2dc5717ff54d20d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1402269.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","the \u0022Golden Triangle\u0022 and \u0022Gold Crescent","IDU"],"locations":["Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["drug smuggling","Drug trafficking","Illicit drug abuse","drug abuse problem","injection drug use","prohibiting drug use","rural drug users","documented drug users","paper reviews drug abuse","illicit drug related problems","China\u0027s HIV","important drug consuming market","prevention of HIV","major drug trans-shipment country","AIDS problems","HIV voluntary counseling","AIDS epidemic","AIDS cases","harm reduction policies","harm reduction programs","Chinese policies","central government","IDU","series of pragmatic policies","public health departments","public security departments","local levels","half of China\u0027s","government leadership","local governments","recent years","Past experience","needle exchange programs","source drugs","association","methadone substitution","published literature","tolerance","conflict","Gold Crescent","nongovernmental organizations","Golden Triangle","utilization of outreach","approach","additional strategies","unpublished official data","areas","Asia","era of globalization","share needles","death penalty"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of a culture system for HEV, the ORF1 expressed using bacterial and mammalian expression systems has shown an ~186 kDa protein, but no processing of the polyprotein has been observed. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the ORF1 polyprotein does not undergo processing into functional units. We have studied ORF1 polyprotein expression and processing through a baculovirus expression vector system because of the high level expression and post-translational modification abilities of this system. RESULTS: The baculovirus expressed ORF1 polyprotein was processed into smaller fragments that could be detected using antibodies directed against tags engineered at both ends. Processing of this ~192 kDa tagged ORF1 polyprotein and accumulation of lower molecular weight species took place in a time-dependent manner. This processing was inhibited by E-64d, a cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor. MALDI-TOF analysis of a 35 kDa processed fragment revealed 9 peptide sequences that matched the HEV methyltransferase (MeT), the first putative domain of the ORF1 polyprotein. Antibodies to the MeT region also revealed an ORF1 processing pattern identical to that observed for the N-terminal tag. CONCLUSION: When expressed through baculovirus, the ORF1 polyprotein of HEV was processed into smaller proteins that correlated with their proposed functional domains. Though the involvement of non-cysteine protease(s) could not be be ruled out, this processing mainly depended upon a cysteine protease.","publish_time":"2006-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sehgal, Deepak; Thomas, Saijo; Chakraborty, Mahua; Jameel, Shahid","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b990d221af78e875a1725512ea8573e7bf332ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1481634.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1481634/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF1 polyprotein expression","ORF1 polyprotein of HEV","ORF1 processing pattern identical","nonstructural polyprotein","ORF1 of hepatitis E virus","HEV methyltransferase","baculovirus expression vector system","involvement of non-cysteine protease","kDa protein","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor","high level expression","RNA helicase","mammalian expression systems","culture system","putative domains","proposed functional domains","antibodies","smaller proteins","smaller fragments","MeT region","functional units","time-dependent manner","place","accumulation of lower molecular weight species","post-translational modification abilities","peptide sequences","enzymes","papain","MALDI-TOF analysis","absence","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","N-terminal tag","tags","CONCLUSION","observations"],"language":"en"},

This outbreak began when a traveler arriving from Hong Kong sought medical care at a small hospital (Hospital A) in Hanoi, initiating a serious and substantial transmission event within the hospital, and subsequent limited spread within the community. METHODS: We surveyed Hospital A personnel for exposure to the index patient and for symptoms of disease during the outbreak. Additionally, serum specimens were collected and assayed for antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody and job-specific attack rates were calculated. A nested case-control analysis was performed to assess risk factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three of 193 (79.3%) clinical and non-clinical staff consented to participate. Excluding job categories with \u003C3 workers, the highest SARS attack rates occurred among nurses who worked in the outpatient and inpatient general wards (57.1, 47.4%, respectively). Nurses assigned to the operating room/intensive care unit, experienced the lowest attack rates (7.1%) among all clinical staff. Serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection was detected in 4 individuals, including 2 non-clinical workers, who had not previously been identified as SARS cases; none reported having had fever or cough. Entering the index patient\u0027s room and having seen (viewed) the patient were the behaviors associated with highest risk for infection by univariate analysis (odds ratios 20.0, 14.0; 95% confidence intervals 4.1\u201397.1, 3.6\u201355.3, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights job categories and activities associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV infection and demonstrates that a broad diversity of hospital workers may be vulnerable during an outbreak. These findings may help guide recommendations for the protection of vulnerable occupational groups and may have implications for other respiratory infections such as influenza.","publish_time":"2006-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Mary G; Anh, Bach Huy; Thu, Vu Hoang; Montgomery, Joel M; Bausch, Daniel G; Shah, J Jina; Maloney, Susan; Leitmeyer, Katrin C; Huy, Vu Quang; Horby, Peter; Plant, Aileen Y; Uyeki, Timothy M","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bcd86c97a06dbdff096f6cb164f9dab35f879f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1562405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1562405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS cases","highest SARS attack rates","SARS-associated coronavirus","Serologic evidence of SARS","small hospital","non-clinical workers","non-clinical staff","highest risk","broad diversity of hospital workers","job-specific attack rates","lowest attack rates","increased risk","antibody","risk factors","nurses","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","study highlights job categories","index patient\u0027s room","medical care","univariate analysis","operating room","respiratory infections","intensive care unit","protection of vulnerable occupational groups","nested case-control analysis","activities","odds ratios","implications","personnel","individuals","substantial transmission event","Hong Kong","subsequent limited spread","outpatient","recommendations","traveler","CONCLUSION","symptoms of disease","exposure","Hanoi","behaviors","inpatient general wards","community","confidence intervals","Northern Vietnam","fever","influenza","METHODS","serum specimens","cough","findings","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters. RESULTS: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E CONCLUSION: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azizi, Ali; Anderson, David E; Ghorbani, Masoud; Gee, Katrina; Diaz-Mitoma, Francisco","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0491da5ae5c2fa38824350bde5462ed82ebc24e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1636068.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1636068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cocktail of HIV","immunogenicity of HIV","different primary HIV","polyvalent vaccine group","effective vaccine","vaccine candidates","gp120 proteins","vaccine-induced immunity","primary isolates","primary subtype B isolates","different gp120s","subtype B isolates MN","polyvalent approach","breadth of immune responses","subtypes B","higher neutralizing antibody responses","breadth of humoral","cellular immunity","envelope glycoprotein","reactive humoral immunity","combinations","highest proliferative immune responses","subtype CD4 reactivity","higher antibody titers","non-syncytium","modest increase","immunized hamsters","golden hamsters","substantial proportion of cross","CHO","Chinese Hamster Ovary","SF162","design","quantitative improvement","multiple epitopes","cell lines","qualitative change","single virus","E CONCLUSION","properties","vaccines","major obstacles","groups","hypervariability","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although high-resolution structural snapshots of viral fusion proteins in their prefusion and postfusion conformations are available, it has been difficult to define intermediate structures of the fusion pathway because of their transient nature. Flaviviruses possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) mediating fusion at acidic pH that is converted from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. Here we show for tick-borne encephalitis virus that exposure of virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH, however, leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Thus, the use of nonphysiological conditions allows a dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, in which membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides important new insights for understanding the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2007-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stiasny, Karin; K\u00F6ssl, Christian; Lepault, Jean; Rey, F\u00E9lix A; Heinz, Franz X","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab40400780c96601bae9d2f4d1c317dc3322f865.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1797619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion pathway","fusion peptide","Viral membrane fusion proceeds","flavivirus fusion process","so-called fusion proteins","dynamic process of viral membrane fusion","high-resolution structural snapshots of viral fusion proteins","acidic pH","E dimers","prefusion dimer","sequence of steps","intermediate conformation","intermediate structures","elusive intermediate","low pH","postfusion trimer","membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers","conformational changes of viral envelope glycoproteins","sequence of events","separate steps","formation of hairpin","postfusion conformations","target membranes","exposure of virions","dissection","important new insights","identification","class","tick-borne encephalitis virus","particles","use of nonphysiological conditions","transient nature","merger","Flaviviruses","trimers","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Appropriate application of real-time PCR in such studies requires the use of a stably expressed \u0027housekeeping\u0027 gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of starting template between samples. RESULTS: We sought to identify appropriate genes for use as internal controls in experimental treatments with estrogen by analyzing the expression of eight functionally distinct \u0027housekeeping\u0027 genes (18S ribosomal RNA [18S rRNA], ribosomal protein l8 [rpl8], elongation factor 1 alpha [ef1a], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [g6pd], beta actin [bactin], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [gapdh], hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 [hprt1], and tata box binding protein [tbp]) following exposure to the environmental estrogen, 17\u03B1-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Exposure to 10 ng/L EE(2 )for 21 days down-regulated the expression of ef1a, g6pd, bactin and gapdh in the liver, and bactin and gapdh in the gonad. Some of these effects were gender-specific, with bactin in the liver and gapdh in the gonad down-regulated by EE(2 )in males only. Furthermore, when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh were used for normalization, the hepatic expression of two genes of interest, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) following exposure to EE(2 )was overestimated. CONCLUSION: Based on the data presented, we recommend 18S rRNA, rpl8, hprt1 and/or tbp, but not ef1a, g6pd, bactin and/or gapdh, as likely appropriate internal controls in real-time PCR studies of estrogens effects in fish. Our studies show that pre-validation of control genes considering the scope and nature of the experiments to be performed, including both gender and tissue type, is critical for accurate assessments of the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in fish.","publish_time":"2007-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filby, Amy L; Tyler, Charles R","journal":"BMC Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b25bce9665a46183274a25151de342c9799ef3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1802086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gapdh","bactin","expression of ef1a","g6pd","appropriate genes","effects of environmental estrogens","fish","hepatic expression","level of gene expression","exposure","real-time PCR studies of estrogens effects","S rRNA","likely appropriate internal controls","Appropriate application of real-time PCR","S ribosomal RNA","rpl8","pre-validation of control genes","hprt1","phosphate dehydrogenase","tbp","housekeeping","liver","gonad","ribosomal protein l8","gender-specific","tata box binding protein","accurate assessments","elongation factor","experimental treatments","beta actin","scope","alpha","glyceraldehyde","tissue type","hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase","cytochrome P450","vitellogenin","vtg","differences","nature","cyp1a","glucose","mechanistic understanding","\u03B1-ethinylestradiol","normalization","fathead minnow","Pimephales promelas","starting template","samples","experiments","data","days","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","males"],"language":"en"},

The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions.

To explore whether the low pH-dependency of influenza A viruses might affect the antiviral effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations, we tested the antiviral effects of this drug on selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH(4)Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC(50 )of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/cell fusion process. Overall, the present study highlights the critical importance of a host cell factor such as intravesicular pH in determining the anti-influenza activity of chloroquine and other lysosomotropic agents.","publish_time":"2007-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Trani, Livia; Savarino, Andrea; Campitelli, Laura; Norelli, Sandro; Puzelli, Simona; D\u0027Ostilio, Daniela; Vignolo, Edoardo; Donatelli, Isabella; Cassone, Antonio","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79695b2d02cc1106f7cbf9ab80e3a53cee4b054e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1878474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1878474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NH","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral effects of chloroquine","inhibitory effect of chloroquine","intravesicular pH","anti-influenza activity of chloroquine","different pH requirements","emerging investigational antiviral drug","low pH-dependency","pH of intracellular vesicles","cell fusion process","time of infection","broad spectrum of antiviral activities","host cell factor","different subtypes","avian viruses","lysosomotropic agents","clear correlation","h post-infection","critical importance","selected human","HA2","achievable concentrations","HA subunit","electrostatic potential","addition experiments","responses","malaria therapy","present study","aminoquinoline","Results","timing"],"language":"en"},

The susceptibility for PRRSV varies between the different breeds of swine. In cell culture, PRRSV virus can be propagated in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and some African green monkey kidney cell lines, such as MARC-145 cells. Previous studies have shown that 3\u0027 untranslated region (UTR) RNAs of the arteriviruses play an important role in the replication of the virus through interactions with cellular proteins. To better understand the differences in the replication capability of PRRSV in different cell lines, we sought to identify the host cellular proteins interacting with PRRSV 3\u0027 UTR RNA. We constructed a cDNA library of MARC-145 cell line in lambda ZAP Express vector and screened the library with the positive sense 3\u0027 UTR RNA of PRRSV. RESULTS: We found that CD151, a host cellular protein, interacting with PRRSV 3\u0027 UTR RNA. The specificity of the interaction between CD151 and PRRSV 3\u0027 UTR RNA was examined by gel shift assay as well as North-Western hybridization. The transfection of CD151 expression clone into BHK-21 rendered these cells susceptible to PRRSV infection, and the transfection of siRNA against CD151 into MARC-145 significantly reduced the level of PRRSV infection. Also, anti-CD151 antibody treatment to MARC-145 completely blocked PRRSV infection. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we suggest that CD151 should cooperate in PRRSV infection in vitro in MARC-145 and BHK-21 cells.","publish_time":"2007-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shanmukhappa, Kumar; Kim, Jeong-Ki; Kapil, Sanjay","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10f0434fa6c87c27f72d85012a851a8662bcda0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1906853.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1906853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV virus","UTR RNA of PRRSV","blocked PRRSV infection","level of PRRSV infection","replication capability of PRRSV","RNA virus","different cell lines","cDNA library of MARC","cell culture","transfection of CD151 expression clone","respiratory syndrome virus","host cellular proteins","anti-CD151 antibody treatment","BHK","cells susceptible","RESULTS","African green monkey kidney cell lines","different breeds of swine","reproductive diseases","transfection of siRNA","primary porcine alveolar macrophages","lambda ZAP Express vector","gel shift assay","RNAs","positive sense","important role","arteriviruses","BACKGROUND","interactions","North-Western hybridization","untranslated region","differences","specificity","susceptibility","Previous studies","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals.

The prospects of purposefully harnessing such an anti-viral defense are under investigation. Here, long-term co-culture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human APOBEC3G in virus-producing pig kidney cells. Inhibition occurred by a deamination-independent mechanism, likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic DNA. PERV inhibition did not require the DNA cytosine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G and, correspondingly, APOBEC3G-attributable hypermutations were not detected. In contrast, over-expression of the sole endogenous APOBEC3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with PERV transmission. Together, these data constitute the first proof-of-principle demonstration that APOBEC3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate anti-viral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirus. These studies suggest that human APOBEC3G-transgenic pigs will provide safer, PERV-less xenotransplantation resources and that analogous cross-species APOBEC3-dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections.","publish_time":"2007-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00F3nsson, Stef\u00E1n R.; LaRue, Rebecca S.; Stenglein, Mark D.; Fahrenkrug, Scott C.; Andr\u00E9sd\u00F3ttir, Valgerdur; Harris, Reuben S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cb33d91e61ad2b33159d68996a0772478612ce8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1963317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963317/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human APOBEC3G protein","human cells","human APOBEC3G-transgenic pigs","porcine endogenous retrovirus","human genomic DNA","sole endogenous APOBEC3 protein of pigs","innate anti-viral defenses of cells","APOBEC3G-attributable hypermutations","innate anti-viral factor","APOBEC3 proteins","DNA cytosine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G","pig kidney cells","zoonotic transmission","exogenous retrovirus infections","Inhibition","exogenous retroviruses","analogous cross-species APOBEC3-dependent restriction strategies","over-expression","deamination-independent mechanism","particle production","undetectable levels","xenotransplantation resources","principle demonstration","replication","integration","long-term co-culture experiments","proof","contrast","investigation","studies","data","prospects"],"language":"en"},

All calves developed diarrhea during the first 24 h after inoculation. The presence and excretion of virus was monitored by electron microscopy. Grossly, the changes were subtle and not striking. The intestinal tract was distended and contained a yellow clear fluid. The small intestinal wall was thin and transparent. Histologic changes were characterized by atrophy and fusion of the villi, decreased height and vacuolation of the intestinal epithelial cells, by a reduced number of goblet cells, crypt hypertrophy and dilatation, and by edema and increased cellularity of the lamina propria mucosae. Ultrastructurally the viral agent infected the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells, undifferentiated epithelial cells and goblet cells of the villi, and occasionally fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the lamina propria mucosae. Morphologic evidence indicated that virus multiplication occurred only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum became dilated, and electron\u2010dense, granulo\u2010fibrillar material filled their cysternae to form smooth membrane\u2010bounded viral factories in the supranuclear cytoplasm of infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ultrastructural cytologic changes in this viral infection consisted of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum network, cellular ribosome depletion, extensive endoplasmic vacuolation and vesiculation of Golgi elements of intestinal epithelial cells, swelling and degeneration of mitochondria, loss of normal nuclear polarity with pyknosis and karyolysis of the nuclei, loss of cytoplasmic matrix, and a broad spectrum of pathologic changes involving the microvilli and terminal web.

Alle K\u00E4lber entwickelten Durchfall w\u00E4hrend der ersten 24 Stunden nach Inokulation. Vorhandensein und die Ausscheidung des Virus wurden elektronenoptisch verfolgt. Sichtbare Ver\u00E4nderungen waren gering und wenig auffallend. Der Darmtrakt war erweitert und enthielt eine gelbe, klare Fl\u00FCssigkeit. Die D\u00FCnndarmwand war d\u00FCnn und durchscheinend. Histologische Ver\u00E4nderungen waren charakterisiert durch Atrophie und Verschmelzung der Zotten, verminderte H\u00F6he und Vakuolisierung der intestinalen Epithelzellen, durch eine reduzierte Anzahl von Gobletzellen, Kryptenhypertrophie und \u2010erweiterung, sowie \u00D6dematisierung und erh\u00F6hte Zellularit\u00E4t der lamina propria mucusae. Ultrastrukturell infizierte das Virus die intestinalen absorptiven Epithelzellen, nichtdifferenzierte Epithelzellen und Gobletzellen der Zotten, und gelegentlich Fibroblasten sowie Endothelzellen der Lamina propria mucosae. Die morphologischen Ver\u00E4nderungen weisen darauf hin, da\u00DF die Virusvermehrung nur im Zytoplasma infizierter Zellen stattfand. Das rauhe und glatte endoplasmatische Retikulum war erweitert, und elektronendichtes, granulo\u2010fibrill\u00E4res Material f\u00FCllte die Zisternen aus, die feine Membran\u2010gebundene Virusvermehrungsfabriken in dem supranukle\u00E4ren Zytoplasmabereich infizierter intestinaler Epithelzellen bildeten. Ultrastrukturelle zytologische Ver\u00E4nderungen bestanden bei dieser Virusinfektion aus Erweiterung des endoplasmatischen Retikulumnetzwerks, zellul\u00E4rem Ribosomenverlust, extensiver endoplasmatischer Vakuolisierung der Golgielemente der intestinalen Epithelzellen, Schwellung und Degeneration von Mitochondrien, Verlust der normalen nukle\u00E4ren Polarit\u00E4t mit Pyknose und Karyolyse der Zellkerne, Verlust der Zytoplasmamatrix, und aus einem breiten Spektrum pathologischer Ver\u00E4nderungen an den Mikrozotten und der terminalen Netzstruktur.

Le virus a infect\u00E9 ultrastructurellement les cellules \u00E9pith\u00E9liales absorbantes de l\u0027intestin, des cellules \u00E9pith\u00E9liales non diff\u00E9renci\u00E9es et des cellules caliciformes des villi, de temps en temps des fibroblastes et des cellules endoth\u00E9liales de Lamina propria mucosae. Les l\u00E9sions morphologiques ont montr\u00E9 que la multiplication du virus n\u0027avait lieu que dans le cytoplasme des cellules infect\u00E9es. Le Reticulum endoplasmique grossier et fin fut \u00E9largi et un mat\u00E9riel granuleux et fibrillaire remplissait les citernes qui formaient de fines r\u00E9gions de r\u00E9plication virale li\u00E9es \u00E0 la membrane dans le voisinage cytoplasmique supranucl\u00E9aire des cellules \u00E9pith\u00E9liales infect\u00E9es de l\u0027intestin. Les l\u00E9sions cytologiques ultrastructurelles lors de cette infection virale consist\u00E8rent en un \u00E9largissement du r\u00E9seau endoplasmique, une perte des ribosomes cellulaires, une vacuolisation endoplasmique extensive des \u00E9l\u00E9ments de Golgi dans les cellules \u00E9pith\u00E9liales de l\u0027intestin, une enflure et une d\u00E9g\u00E9n\u00E9rescence des mitochondries, une perte de la polarit\u00E9 nucl\u00E9aire normale avec une picnose et une carylolyse des noyaux cellulaires, une perte de la matrice cytoplasmique et un large \u00E9ventail de l\u00E9sions pathologiques des microvilli et des tissus terminaux. RESUMEN: Modificaciones patol\u00F3gicas fotomicrosc\u00F3picas y ultraestructurales en la infecci\u00F3n intestinal de terneros reci\u00E9n nacidos por virus Corona Se infectaron por v\u00EDa oral siete terneros convencionales con la estirpe de virus Corona LY\u2010138, la cual es originaria de terneros, infectados naturalmente, con diarrea. Todos los terneros manifestaban diarrea durante las 24 horas primeras despu\u00E9s de la inoculaci\u00F3n. Se segu\u00EDa electr\u00F3nico\u00F3pticamente la presencia y eliminaci\u00F3n de virus. Las modificaciones visibles eran escasas y se destacaban poco. El tracto intestinal se hallaba dilatado, conteniendo un l\u00EDquido amarillo claro. La pared del intestino delgado era tenue y transl\u00FAcida. Las modificaciones histopatol\u00F3gicas se caracterizaban por atrofia y soldadura de las villosidades, altura reducida y vacuolizaci\u00F3n de las c\u00E9lulas epiteliales intestinales, por una cantidad reducida de c\u00E9lulas caliciformes, hipertrofia y ensanchamiento de las criptas, y por edematizaci\u00F3n y celularidad aumentada de la l\u00E1mina propia mucosa. El virus infectaba ultraestructuralmente las c\u00E9lulas epiteliales intestinales absortivas, c\u00E9lulas epiteliales no diferenciadas y c\u00E9lulas caliciformes de las villosidades, y, en ocasiones fibroblastos y c\u00E9lulas endoteliales de la l\u00E1mina propia mucosa. Las modificaciones morfol\u00F3gicas se\u00F1alan que la multiplicaci\u00F3n de virus solo tuvo lugar en el citoplasma de las c\u00E9lulas infectadas. El ret\u00EDculo endoplasm\u00E1tico basto y fino se hallaba dilatado y material granulosofibrilar, opaco a los electrones, ocupaba las cisternas, las cuales formaban lugares finos de replicaci\u00F3n antiviral, ligados a las membranas en el \u00E1mbito citoplasm\u00E1tico supranuclear de c\u00E9lulas epiteliales intestinales infectadas. Las modificaciones citol\u00F3gicas ultraestructurales consist\u00EDan en esta infecci\u00F3n a virus en dilataci\u00F3n del ret\u00EDculo endoplasm\u00E1tico, p\u00E9rdida celular de ribosomas, vacuolizaci\u00F3n endoplasm\u00E1tica extensiva de los elementos de Golgi de las c\u00E9lulas epiteliales intestinales, tumefacci\u00F3n y degeneraci\u00F3n de mitocondrias, p\u00E9rdida de la polaridad nuclear normal con picnosis y cariolisis de los n\u00FAcleos celulares, p\u00E9rdida de la matriz citoplasm\u00E1tica, y en un espectro amplio de modificaciones patol\u00F3gicas en las microvillosidades y tejidos terminales.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doughri, A.

Of the 3590 diagnostic samples from Austrian dogs (\u22642 years old), 8.7% contained Isospora oocysts, 78% of which from dogs up to 4 months of age. Non\u2010haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic diarrhoea were significantly more prevalent in Isospora\u2010infected animals than in coccidia\u2010negative ones. Twelve of 15 litters from a large commercial dog breeding unit (examined from the third to the 10th week of life) also excreted Isospora (average prevalence: 36.4%) in intensities from 333 to 35 000 oocysts per gram of faeces (opg). In experimental trials 26 3\u2010week\u2010old Beagle puppies were infected with low (600\u20136000), medium (10 000) or high (20 000) dose of Isospora ohioensis\u2010group or Isospora canis field isolates. Additionally 21 puppies were infected as above and treated with a symmetrical triazintrione. Parasitological and clinical parameters were examined. The two Isospora species differed significantly concerning intensity and duration of excretion. The pre\u2010patent period was 6\u20137 days for I. ohioensis and 10\u201312 days for I. canis. The latter species showed significantly longer excretion and higher opg. This was not influenced by simultaneous infections with both species. Individual patterns of faecal consistency were very variable, irrespective of the infection dose. Treatment significantly reduced both the intensity and the duration of oocysts excretion as well as diarrhoea in comparison with the infected, untreated group and thus proved to be effective against coccidiosis in experimental infections.","publish_time":"2006-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buehl, I.

Driven principally by human and mouse studies, comparative MHC projects among other mammalian species offer certain advantages in connecting MHC genome characters to natural situations. We have studied the MHC in the domestic cat and in several wild species of Felidae. Our observations affirm class I and class II homology with other mammalian orders, derivative gene duplications during the Felidae radiation, abundant persistent trans\u2010species allele polymorphism, recombination\u2010derived amino acid motifs, and inverted ratios of non\u2010synonymous to silent substitutions in the MHC peptide\u2010binding regions, consistent with overdominant selection in class I and II genes. MHC diversity as quantified in population studies is a powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction for several endangered species including cheetahs, Asiatic lions, Florida panthers and tigers. In two cases (Florida panther and cheetah), reduced MHC variation may be contributing to uniform population sensitivity to emerging infectious pathogens. The Felidae species, nearly all endangered and monitored for conservation concerns, have allowed a glimpse of species adaptation, mediated by MHC divergence, using comparative inferences drawn from human and mouse models.","publish_time":"2006-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Brien, Stephen J.; Yuhki, Naoya","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4faf6d666003c405eec2f4dfd55ec0b6b427ad2f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":["Florida"],"keyphrases":["mammalian species","MHC peptide","MHC divergence","Felidae species","MHC diversity","endangered species","comparative MHC projects","MHC genome characters","reduced MHC variation","wild species of Felidae","class","glimpse of species adaptation","mammalian orders","Felidae radiation","population studies","mouse studies","human","abundant persistent trans\u2010species allele polymorphism","comparative inferences","mammalian major histocompatibility complex","Florida panthers","mouse models","uniform population sensitivity","recombination","derived amino acid motifs","inverted ratios of non\u2010synonymous","silent substitutions","Asiatic lions","cheetahs","derivative gene duplications","binding regions","powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction","certain advantages","great deal","overdominant selection","processes","immunologists","homology","evolutionary biologists","patterns","infectious pathogens","tigers","Summary","natural situations","domestic cat","conservation concerns"],"language":"en"},

In our efforts to define gene expression alterations in Barrett\u0027s\u2010related adenocarcinomas (BA), we produced eight SAGE libraries and obtained a total of 457,894 expressed tags with 32,035 (6.9%) accounting for singleton tags. The tumor samples produced an average of 71,804 tags per library, whereas normal samples produced an average of 42,669 tags per library. Our libraries contained 67,200 unique tags representing 16,040 known gene symbols. Five hundred and sixty\u2010eight unique tags were differentially expressed between BAs and normal tissue samples (at least twofold; P \u2264 0.05), 395 of these matched to known genes. Interestingly, the distribution of altered genes was not uniform across the human genome. Overexpressed genes tended to cluster in well\u2010defined hot spots located in certain chromosomes. For example, chromosome 19 had 26 overexpressed genes, of which 18 mapped to 19q13. Using the gene ontology approach for functional classification of genes, we identified several groups that are relevant to carcinogenesis. We validated the SAGE results of five representative genes (ANPEP, ECGF1, PP1201, EIF5A1, and GKN1) using quantitative real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription PCR on 31 BA samples and 26 normal samples. In addition, we performed an immunohistochemistry analysis for ANPEP, which demonstrated overexpression of ANPEP in 6/7 (86%) Barrett\u0027s dysplasias and 35/65 (54%) BAs.

The causative agent is the SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, Rhabdoviridae family, and a List 1 pathogen notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health. This study describes the diagnosis of an SVCV pathogen isolated in October 2015 from wild common carp inhabiting a natural lagoon in central Mexico. While neither an epidemic nor fish mortalities were reported, the collected killed specimens exhibited clinical signs of disease (e.g., exopthalmia, moderate abdominal distension and haemorrhaging, as well as internal haemorrhages and adhesions). Histological results of injuries were consistent with the pathology caused by SVCV. This finding was supported by the isolation of a virus in EPC and BF\u20102 cells and subsequent RT\u2010PCR confirmation of SVCV. The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon. The status of this virus is also unknown for other bodies of water within this region.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ortega, Cesar; Ca\u00F1as\u2010Lopez, Leticia; Irgang, Rute; Fajardo, Ra\u00FAl; Poblete\u2010Morales, Mat\u00EDas; Valladares-Carranza, Benjamin; Tapia\u2010Cammas, Diana; Avenda\u00F1o\u2010Herrera, Ruben","journal":"J Fish Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b69d6f57154e748e5524dfa7011d3b394167fe09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Organization for Animal Health","SVCV"],"locations":["Mexico","North America"],"keyphrases":["SVCV pathogen","risk of SVCV","PCR confirmation of SVCV","report of SVCV detection","southern geographical range of SVCV","SVC virus","wild common carp","phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences","natural lagoon","pathogen notifiable","various cyprinid species","natural body of water","Spring viraemia of carp","Cyprinus carpio carpio","feral cohabitating cyprinid species","central Mexico","bodies of water","fish mortalities","infectious disease responsible","clinical signs of disease","severe economic losses","haemorrhaging","cells","exopthalmia","isolates","subsequent RT","collected killed specimens","World Organization","Rhabdoviridae family","List","BF","tributaries","member","North America","moderate abdominal distension","Sprivivirus genus","effluents","EPC","Animal Health","Histological results of injuries","causative agent","internal haemorrhages","isolation","pathology","diagnosis","Ia genogroup","adhesions","region","status","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Shape\u2010volume relationships contradict trends seen in comparisons among distantly related limbed and limbless squamates (lizards and snakes), in which snakes have relatively more abdominal volume. Comparison within a phylogenetically restricted group allows the identification of functional and ontogenetic factors potentially limiting reproductive output. In Bruchymeles, constraining factors include retention of anterior body segments bearing parasternal ribs, which prevents extension of the clutch anteriorly within the body, and reduction of allometry of abdominal segments, which provides extended series of uniformly\u2010sized vertebrae for limbless locomotion, but reduces the relative size of the abdomen. The latter trait is associated with overall size reduction, which affects relative egg\u2010size and packing.

On presentation, all cats were asymptomatic; free of opportunistic infections; and had normal complete blood counts, bone marrow morphologies, marrow progenitor frequencies, and progenitor in vitro growth characteristics. During study, 2 cats remained healthy, 2 cats showed mild clinical signs, and 1 cat developed a malignant neoplasm (ie, bronchiolar\u2010alveolar adenocarcinoma). Although persistent hematologic abnormalities were not observed, intermittent peripheral leukopenias were common. In 3 of 5 FlV\u2010seropositive cats, lymphopenia (\u003C 1,500 lymphs/\u03BCL; normal reference range, 1,500 to 7,000 lymphs/\u03BCL) was a frequent finding and the absolute lymphocyte counts had a tendency to progressively decline. One of the other 2 cats had consistently low to low\u2010normal absolute neutrophil counts (1,300 to 4,800 segs/\u03BCL; mean, 2,730 segs/\u03BCL; normal reference range, 2,500 to 12,500 segs/\u03BCL), and the remaining cat had consistently normal leukograms, except for a transient period (ie, 11 months) of benign lymphocytosis (7,200 to 13,430 lymphs/\u03BCL) early in the study. Periodic examinations of bone marrow aspirates revealed normal to slightly depressed myeloid\u2010to\u2010erythroid ratios with normal cellular morphology and maturation. Bone marrow abnormalities observed late in the study included mild dysmor\u2010phic changes (ie, megaloblastic features) in 2 cats, and a significant decrease (60% of controls, P \u003C .001) in the frequencies of burst\u2010forming units erythroid (BFU\u2010E) in marrow cultures of FIV\u2010seropositive cats compared with uninfected control cats.

In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host\u2010range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross\u2010species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV). The opportunities for cross\u2010species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live\u2010vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross\u2010species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host\u2010range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.

Specific DNA amplification was monitored spectrophotometrically by real time turbidimeter and the quantity of RNA was calculated. Measles virus genome was detected in 44 of 50 stored NPS by RT\u2010PCR and in 49 by RT\u2010LAMP. The vaccine strain was discriminated from wild strains after sequencing the LAMP products. RT\u2010LAMP is a useful rapid diagnostic method for the detection of measles virus without any special apparatus, showing higher sensitivity than RT\u2010PCR, and expected to be applied for hospital\u2010based infection control and for laboratory\u2010based measles surveillance.

CD13 is involved in diverse functions, including degradation of peptide mediators, cellular adhesion, migration, viral endocytosis, signaling, and positive modulation of phagocytosis mediated by Fc\u03B3Rs and other phagocytic receptors. In this work, we explored whether besides acting as an accessory receptor, CD13 by itself is a primary phagocytic receptor. We found that hCD13 mediates efficient phagocytosis of large particles (erythrocytes) modified so as to interact with the cell only through CD13 in human macrophages and THP\u20101 monocytic cells. The extent of this phagocytosis is comparable with the phagocytosis mediated through the canonical phagocytic receptor Fc\u03B3RI. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hCD13 expression in the nonphagocytic cell line HEK293 is sufficient to enable these cells to internalize particles bound through hCD13. CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is independent of other phagocytic receptors, as it occurs in the absence of Fc\u03B3Rs, CR3, and most phagocytic receptors. Phagocytosis through CD13 is independent of its enzymatic activity but is dependent on actin rearrangement and activation of PI3K and is partially dependent on Syk activation. Moreover, the cross\u2010linking of CD13 with antibodies rapidly induced pSyk in human macrophages. Finally, we observed that antibody\u2010mediated cross\u2010linking of hCD13, expressed in the murine macrophage\u2010like J774 cell line, induces production of ROS. These results demonstrate that CD13 is a fully competent phagocytic receptor capable of mediating internalization of large particles.","publish_time":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Licona\u2010Lim\u00F3n, Ileana; Garay\u2010Canales, Claudia A.; Mu\u00F1oz\u2010Paleta, Ofelia; Ortega, Enrique","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd2f45bcb31d6d727c246838563b4e2b0b2b4e69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cross\u2010linking of CD13","mediated phagocytosis","phagocytic receptors","primary phagocytic receptor","mediated cross\u2010linking of hCD13","efficient phagocytosis of large particles","canonical phagocytic receptor Fc\u03B3RI","positive modulation of phagocytosis","human macrophages","hCD13 expression","accessory receptor","competent phagocytic receptor capable of mediating internalization of large particles","J774 cell line","monocytic cells","dendritic cells","nonphagocytic cell line HEK293","activation of PI3K","Syk activation","absence of Fc\u03B3Rs","bound ectopeptidase","cellular adhesion","degradation of peptide mediators","migration","antibodies","viral endocytosis","actin rearrangement","enzymatic activity","induced pSyk","monocytes","murine macrophage","THP","diverse functions","CR3","erythrocytes","production of ROS","membrane","antibody","extent","results","work"],"language":"en"},

Thirty\u2010five examples were found of intrahelical disulfides involving a CXXC motif between the N\u2010Cap and third helical positions. GLY and PRO were the most common amino acids at positions 1 and 2, respectively. The N\u2010Cap residue for disulfide bonded CXXC motifs had average (\u03D5,\u03C8) values of (\u2212112 \u00B1 25.2\u00B0, 106 \u00B1 25.4\u00B0). To further explore conformational requirements for intrahelical disulfides, CYS pairs were introduced at positions N\u2010Cap\u20103; 1,4; 7,10 in two helices of an Escherichia coli thioredoxin mutant lacking its active site disulfide (nSS Trx). In both helices, disulfides formed spontaneously during purification only at positions N\u2010Cap\u20103. Mutant stabilities were characterized by chemical denaturation studies (in both oxidized and reduced states) and differential scanning calorimetry (oxidized state only). All oxidized as well as reduced mutants were destabilized relative to nSS Trx. All mutants were redox active, but showed decreased activity relative to wild\u2010type thioredoxin. Such engineered disulfides can be used to probe helix start sites in proteins of unknown structure and to introduce redox activity into proteins.

Club cell protein 16 kDa (CC16) is a major pneumoprotein secreted by club cells of the bronchial epithelium and eliminated by the renal pathway. CC16 seems to be a biomarker of epithelial damage in asthma. However, its value as a marker of acute bronchiolitis severity and later recurrent wheezing are uncertain, especially the value of its urinary assay for this purpose. A prospective, observational, analytical study was conducted at Clermont\u2010Ferrand University Hospital to correlate serum CC16 level with clinical severity of bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants aged less than 1 year. We analyzed correlations between serum and urinary CC16, CC16 levels and Wainwright score, immediate morbidity due to bronchiolitis, causal viruses, and recurrent wheezing 1 year after inclusion. In 166 infants, serum CC16 did not correlate with acute bronchiolitis severity (P = .49), but urinary CC16 did (P \u003C .001). In multivariate analysis, urinary CC16 correlated mainly with urinary retinol binding protein (RBP; r = 0.70; P \u003C .001). The logCC16u/logRBPu ratio correlated significantly with severity (P = .02). CC16 levels were not correlated with recurrent wheezing at 1 year. Urinary CC16 could be a useful biomarker in acute bronchiolitis for specific indications. This noninvasive assay would be particularly useful in the young infant population. Several factors must be taken into account in its interpretation, mainly tubular function. Further studies are needed to assess these factors.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egron, Carole; Labb\u00E9, Andr\u00E9; Rochette, Emmanuelle; Mulliez, Aur\u00E9lien; Bernard, Alfred; Amat, Flore","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39788a490703d4619b98c45bfb6119a170e54246.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167874.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167874/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clermont\u2010Ferrand University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urinary CC16","CC16 levels","serum CC16 level","urinary assay","marker of acute bronchiolitis severity","clinical severity of bronchiolitis","recurrent wheezing","year","urinary retinol binding protein","useful biomarker","hospitalized infants","value","factors","Club cell protein","immediate morbidity","high morbidity","club cells","noninvasive assay","biomarker of epithelial damage","Wainwright score","Clermont\u2010Ferrand University Hospital","causal viruses","analytical study","kDa","bronchial epithelium","major pneumoprotein","specific indications","logRBPu ratio","interpretation","account","young infant population","asthma","inclusion","multivariate analysis","correlations","tubular function","renal pathway","logCC16u","purpose","studies"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: After the mice had been immunized intramuscularly and/or intraperitoneally with pcDNA3.1-N and rAd-N in prime-triple boost immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses were detected. RESULTS: After detection, different levels of anti-N humoral and cellular responses are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen and the reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. However, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was not significantly altered by the different prime-boost immunizations or the recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen alone, but lymphoproliferation and interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) secretion were all enhanced by heterologous combination immunizations compared to homologous combinations. For the reverse sequence immunization regimen, lymphoproliferation, IFN-\u03B3 and CTL responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen. CONCLUSION: Taken together, of all the combinations, the prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N can effectively induce SARS-CoV-N-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The present results suggest that DNA immunization followed by recombinant adenovirus boosting could be used as a potential SARS-CoV vaccine in the induction of an enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.","publish_time":"2006-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chunling, Ma; Kun, Yao; Jian, Xu; Jian, Qin; Hua, Sun; Minsheng, Zhu","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92df84431c14b4d2e57d36ac437d52951b282156.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N prime-rAd","N boost regimen","rAd-N prime-pcDNA3","N-specific","N gene","different levels of anti-N humoral","prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3","recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3","cellular responses","cellular immune responses","humoral immune response","different prime-boost immunizations","induction of humoral","reverse sequence immunization regimen","CTL responses","DNA immunization","recombinant adenovirus boosting","reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations","IFN-\u03B3","homologous combinations","lymphoproliferation","potential SARS-CoV vaccine","interferon-\u03B3","mice","homologous vaccinations","recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","present results","heterologous combination immunizations","genetic vaccines","replication-defective adenoviral vector","secretion","detection","protein plasmid","significant difference","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","immunogenicity","controls","OBJECTIVE","METHOD","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It contains many viruses that threaten human health, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) of the genus Flavivirus as well as hepatitis C virus of the genus Hepacivirus. Cell culture systems highly permissive for the Flaviviridae viruses are very useful for their isolation, propagation, and diagnosis, an understanding of their biology, and the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. Previously, we isolated a human hepatoma HuH-7-derived cell clone, Huh7.5.1\u20138, which is highly permissive to hepatitis C virus infection. Here, we have characterized flavivirus infection in the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line by comparing with that in the African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cell line, which is permissive for a wide spectrum of viruses. Upon infection with JEV, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells produced a higher amount of virus particles early in infection and were more susceptible to virus-induced cell death than Vero cells. Similar outcomes were obtained when the cells were infected with another flavivirus, YFV (17D-204 strain). Quantification of cellular and extracellular viral RNA revealed that high JEV production in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells can be attributed to rapid viral replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection. In a plaque assay, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells developed JEV plaques more rapidly than Vero cells. Although this was not the case with YFV plaques, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells developed higher numbers of YFV plaques than Vero cells. Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding an antiviral RNA helicase, RIG-I, showed that Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells expressed not only a full-length RIG-I mRNA with a known dominant-negative missense mutation but also variants without the mutation. However, the latter mRNAs lacked exon 5/6\u221212, indicating functional loss of RIG-I in the cells. These characteristics of the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line are helpful for flavivirus detection, titration, and propagation.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saito, Kyoko; Fukasawa, Masayoshi; Shirasago, Yoshitaka; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Osada, Naoki; Yamaji, Toshiyuki; Wakita, Takaji; Konishi, Eiji; Hanada, Kentaro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63d83c10f9d445a7d44cf7a105e156ba8f509847.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Huh7","Vero cells","flavivirus infection","virus particles","hepatitis C virus infection","virus-induced cell death","JEV plaques","efficient virus release","Japanese encephalitis virus","yellow fever virus","derived cell clone","Flaviviridae viruses","genus Flavivirus","Cell culture systems","flavivirus detection","higher numbers of YFV plaques","African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cell line","extracellular viral RNA","antiviral RNA helicase","high JEV production","family of enveloped viruses","wide spectrum of viruses","propagation","full-length RIG","functional loss of RIG","genus Hepacivirus","antiviral agents","human health","human hepatoma","positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome","rapid viral replication kinetics","known dominant-negative missense mutation","biology","diagnosis","development of vaccines","variants","Sequence analysis of cDNA","Quantification of cellular","isolation","titration","understanding","exon","strain","plaque assay","Similar outcomes","mRNAs","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Often doctors refuse to respect controversial choices on paternalistic grounds.

But more importantly, sometimes such choices make for a better, more autonomous life. Sometimes, such choices reflect considerations of global well-being or altruism, or idiosyncratic attitudes to risk. Sometimes, they reflect unusual values. However, in some other cases, controversial choices are irrational and are not expressions of our autonomy. Doctors should assist patients to make rational if individual choices.

We now report actively demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which we demonstrate inhibits myelination and remyelination in vitro. This inhibitory activity is associated with the appearance of multi-branched \u2018pre-myelinating\u2019 MBP(\u002B)/PLP(\u002B) oligodendrocytes that interact with axons but fail to assemble myelin sheaths; an oligodendrocyte phenotype described previously in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. This inhibitory activity is not due to a direct effect of FGF9 on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage but is mediated by factors secreted by astrocytes. Transcriptional profiling and functional validation studies demonstrate that these include effects dependent on increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-sensitive proteases, enzymes more commonly associated with extracellular matrix remodelling. Further, we found that FGF9 induces expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7, two pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to recruitment of microglia and macrophages into multiple sclerosis lesions. These data indicate glial expression of FGF9 can initiate a complex astrocyte-dependent response that contributes to two distinct pathogenic pathways involved in the development of multiple sclerosis lesions. Namely, induction of a pro-inflammatory environment and failure of remyelination; a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal injury and loss in patients.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindner, Maren; Th\u00FCmmler, Katja; Arthur, Ariel; Brunner, Sarah; Elliott, Christina; McElroy, Daniel; Mohan, Hema; Williams, Anna; Edgar, Julia M.; Schuh, Cornelia; Stadelmann, Christine; Barnett, Susan C.; Lassmann, Hans; M\u00FCcklisch, Steve; Mudaliar, Manikhandan; Schaeren-Wiemers, Nicole; Meinl, Edgar; Linington, Christopher","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6af5340202e9e22924da7fdb0c7b8ad173dfac4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185739.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of multiple sclerosis lesions","demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions","pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis","glial expression of FGF9","expression of Ccl2","Remyelination failure","failure of remyelination","demyelinating lesions","effects dependent","direct effect of FGF9","patients","inhibitory activity","increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor","increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase","pro-inflammatory chemokines","pro-inflammatory environment","combination of effects","oligodendrocyte phenotype","oligodendrocyte lineage","complex astrocyte-dependent response","recruitment of microglia","Ccl7","appearance of multi-branched","important role","MBP","enzymes","pre-myelinating","sensitive proteases","functional validation studies","cells","macrophages","axonal injury","distinct pathogenic pathways","Transcriptional profiling","myelin sheaths","axons","molecular mechanisms","factors","loss","induction","data","extracellular matrix remodelling","oligodendrocytes","PLP","astrocytes"],"language":"en"},

We report that by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA of LRRK2 is expressed in soluble extracts of human brain, liver, and heart and in cultured human astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendroglia as well as in human neuroblastoma cell lines. We find by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein (Lrrk2) specific for C-terminal residues 2511-2527 that an apparent full-length protein and several of its fractions are expressed in soluble extracts of normal human brain. By immunocytochemistry, the antibody recognizes neurons, and more weakly astrocytes and microglia, in normal brain tissue. It intensely labels Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. It also labels a subset of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and the Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). It labels thorn-shaped astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PDCG; oligodendroglial inclusions in multiple system atrophy; Pick bodies in Pick disease; nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in Huntington disease; and intraneuronal and glial inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In summary, LRRK2 is constitutively expressed in neurons and also in glial cells of human brain.

Laboratory experiments with various polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC) and gelatin filters in conjunction with Button\u2122 Inhalable samplers and three-piece cassettes were undertaken. Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B.atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS2 virion particles ranged from 10 to 80 nm. Monodisperse 350 nm PSL particles were used as this size was believed to have the lowest filtration efficiency. NaCl solution (1% weight by volume) was used to create a polydisperse aerosol in the 10\u2013600 nm range. The physical collection efficiency was determined by measuring particle concentrations size-selectively upstream and downstream of the filters. The PTFE and gelatin filters showed excellent collection efficiency (\u003E93%) for all of the test particles. The PC filters showed lower collection efficiency for small particles especially \u003C100 nm. Among the tested filters, the lowest collection efficiencies, 49 and 22%, were observed for 1 and 3-\u03BCm pore size PC filters at the particle sizes of 47 and 63 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the effect of filter material is more significant for the size range of single virions than for bacteria. The effect of filter loading was examined by exposing filters to mixtures of PSL particles, which aimed at mimicking typical indoor dust levels and size distributions. A 4-h loading did not cause significant change in the physical collection efficiency of the tested filters.","publish_time":"2006-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"BURTON, NANCY CLARK; GRINSHPUN, SERGEY A.; REPONEN, TIINA","journal":"Ann Occup Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac5b39bd3520a5e2c89bbcae0b588eeb947d925b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSL","PTFE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gelatin filters","tested filters","nm PSL particles","available filters","physical collection efficiency","nm range","lower collection efficiency","excellent collection efficiency","\u03BCm pore size PC filters","test particles","size distributions","small particles","mixtures of PSL particles","particle concentrations size","lowest collection efficiencies","lowest filtration efficiency","MS2 virion particles","size range of single virions","PTFE","effect of filter loading","effect of filter material","significant change","Bacillus atrophaeus","particle sizes","atrophaeus endospores","non-biological test aerosols","airborne bacteria","h loading","NaCl solution","Button","conjunction","polycarbonate","Inhalable samplers","polystyrene latex","typical indoor dust levels","various polytetrafluoroethylene","aerodynamic diameter","three-piece cassettes","Laboratory experiments","viruses","sodium chloride","weight","study","nanometer","volume","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to identify differences between incidence rates, risk factors, clinical presentations, and outcomes of candidemia in SOT recipients and non\u2010SOT patients. Data from the multicenter prospective Australian Candidaemia Study were examined. From August 2001 to July 2004, 24 episodes (2.2%; 24/1068) of candidemia were identified in SOT recipients. During this period, the numbers of transplanted organs included liver (n=455), kidney (n=1605), single lung (n=57), bilateral lung (n=183), heart and lung (n=18), heart (n=157), and pancreas (n=62). The overall annual estimated incidence of candidemia in SOT recipients was higher (3 per 1000 transplant admissions) than in non\u2010SOT patients (incidence 0.21 per 1000 admissions; P\u003C0.001). The incidence and timing of candidemia post transplant was influenced by the transplanted organ type, with the majority of episodes (n=14, 54%) occurring \u003E6 months after renal transplantation. Risk factors for candidemia in the month preceding diagnosis were similar to non\u2010SOT recipients except for corticosteroid therapy (P\u003C0.001). Antifungal prophylaxis did not select for more resistant or non\u2010albicans Candida species in the SOT group. The 30\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was similar to non\u2010SOT patients with candidemia and remains high at 21%.

Both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism. Since the SSCP analysis concerned an expressed DRB gene it can be concluded that the level of functional MHC class II polymorphism, at least at the DRB locus, is low in Swedish moose. DNA fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low MHC variability could be explained by a low degree of genome\u2010wide genetic diversity. Hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population, but the data suggest that the low MHC variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck. However, since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than MHC sequences, the low levels of MHC diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin. The selection pressure for MHC variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"ELLEGREN, H.; MIKK, S.; WALLIN, K.; ANDERSSON, L.","journal":"Mol Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3add6dc08f0fc26d5196c61de47b2e65d40abf62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRB","SSCP","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHC sequences","low levels of MHC diversity","unusual pattern of low MHC variability","genetic variability","level of functional MHC class","Swedish moose","low degree of genome","DRB loci","DRB locus","limited amounts of polymorphism","minisatellite sequences","natural population","recent population bottleneck","restriction fragment length polymorphism","single strand conformation polymorphism","expressed DRB gene","wide genetic diversity","SSCP analysis","minisatellite probes","RFLP","DQB","major histocompatibility complex","similarity indices","solitary life style","lateral transmission of pathogens","average","DQA","data","techniques","selection pressure","possibility","Hybridizations","methods","ancient origin","DNA fingerprinting"],"language":"en"},

The \u03B11\u2010globulin fraction was higher in double infected animals (FIV and FeLV positive, F\u2010F) (3.55 g/dl), than in FeLV\u002B or FIV\u002B cats (3.10 and 3.07 g/dl respectively), but no statistical conclusions may be drawn from this fact because of the low number of F\u2010F animals. This technique may help to assess the initial clinical status of retrovirus\u2010infected cats, and the clinical course of these chronic diseases, specifically during and after suitable therapy.","publish_time":"2007-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mir\u00F3, G.; Dom\u00E9nech, A.; Escolar, E.; Collado, V.

Method: A short course, including an introductory lecture and a three component competency based assessment exercise testing student\u0027s knowledge and ability in infection control measures was incorporated into the previously established training programme. The assessment exercises included a written test of students\u2019 knowledge of the Infection Control Policy, a unit management exercise and a hand hygiene assessment. The infection control competency was initially incorporated into the final term of the second year in 2004 and is now an established part of the 5\u2010year dental undergraduate degree programme. Re\u2010assessments were scheduled (at the start of third year) for students failing to meet the required standard as successful completion of this course was compulsory prior to students being allowed to treat their first patients. Student performance over the last 2 years on this course and during their first year on clinic were analysed to determine potential improvements in student knowledge and application in infection control. Examination results from the year 3, infection control spot test were compared with those of earlier years. In addition, the opinions, as assessed by questionnaire analysis, of dental staff and students on the infection control competency were obtained. Results: All students successfully completed the infection control competency (either at first or second attempt) and were subsequently allowed to enter clinical training in year 3. Significant improvements were seen in students passing the course at their initial attempt, 42% and 78%, in the 2004 and 2005 academic years, respectively. Also subsequent testing of these students during their first year on clinic showed marked increases in awareness and knowledge of the infection control protocols. Staff and student feedback on this course was also found to be highly supportive of the introduction of the infection control competency. Conclusion: Incorporation of additional formal pre\u2010clinical teaching and introduction of an infection competency potentially provides enduring knowledge and clinical application benefits.","publish_time":"2007-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milward, Mike R.; Cooper, Paul R.","journal":"Eur J Dent Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17287a93510aeac050814ac8f920c4e2aa583208.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infection Control Policy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["knowledge of infection control","infection competency","infection control competency assessment","Infection Control Policy","infection control measures","infection control protocols","infection control spot test","student knowledge","component competency","enduring knowledge","assessment exercise testing student\u0027s knowledge","introduction","year dental undergraduate degree programme","short course","written test of students\u2019 knowledge","dental staff","assessment exercises","clinical training","undergraduate dental student\u0027s awareness","hand hygiene assessment","clinical application benefits","student feedback","Student performance","established training programme","earlier years","academic years","potential improvements","subsequent testing","Significant improvements","Examination results","initial attempt","unit management exercise","Incorporation of additional formal pre\u2010clinical teaching","ability","successful completion","introductory lecture","marked increases","required standard","questionnaire analysis","Conclusion","opinions","start","final term","study","Method","Re\u2010assessments","Objectives","patients"],"language":"en"},

As a consequence, cleaning and disinfecting hospital environments play an important role among strategies for preventing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adenosine triphosphate (ATP) presence, measured by bioluminescence methods, can predict microbiological contamination of hospital surfaces. The study was carried out between September and December 2012 at the University Hospital \u201CP. Giaccone\u201D of Palermo. A total of 193 randomly selected surfaces (tables, lockers, furnishings) were sampled and analyzed in order to assess ATP levels (expressed as relative light units or RLU) and aerobic colony count (ACC) or presence of S. aureus. ACC had median values of 1.85 cfu/cm(2) (interquartile range = 4.16) whereas ATP median was 44.6 RLU/cm(2) (interquartile range = 92.3). Overall, 85 (44.0%) surfaces exceeded the established microbial benchmark: 73 (37.8%) exceeded the 2.5 cfu/cm(2) ACC standard, 5 (2.6%) surfaces were positive for S. aureus and 7 (3.6%) showed both the presence of S. aureus and an ACC of more than 2.5 cfu/cm(2). ACC and bioluminescence showed significant differences in the different surface sites (p \u003C 0.001). A significant correlation was found between ACC and RLU values (p-value \u003C 0.001; R(2) = 0.29) and increasing RLU values were significantly associated with a higher risk of failing the benchmark (p \u003C 0.001). Our data suggest that bioluminescence could help in measuring hygienic quality of hospital surfaces using a quick and sensitive test that can be an useful proxy of microbial contamination; however, further analysis will be necessary to assess the cost-efficacy of this methodology before requiring incorporation in hospital procedures.","publish_time":"2013-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harper, Martin; Amodio, Emanuele; Cannova, Lucia; Villafrate, Maria Rosaria; Merendino, Anna Maria; Aprea, Luigi; Calamusa, Giuseppe","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9fed96f51f082d8f5c457918c841e128cc7e8b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["University Hospital","ATP","ACC","RLU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Contaminated hospital surfaces","microbiological contamination of hospital surfaces","hygienic quality of hospital surfaces","hospital procedures","selected surfaces","University Hospital","RLU values","ACC standard","presence","aureus","cfu","disinfecting hospital environments","ATP median","median values","ATP levels","bioluminescence methods","p-value","interquartile range","established microbial benchmark","important role","significant differences","useful proxy of microbial contamination","higher risk","significant correlation","present study","risk of nosocomial infection","healthcare-associated colonization","important environmental reservoir of microorganisms","strategies","relative light units","aerobic colony count","different surface sites","methodology","sensitive test","adenosine triphosphate","exposed patients","tables","lockers","incorporation","consequence","cleaning","cost-efficacy","infections","analysis","Giaccone","furnishings","aim","order","Palermo","total","data"],"language":"en"},

Because of the increasing incidence of viral infections, there is a need to evaluate novel engineering control methods for inactivation of viruses on surfaces. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is considered a promising method to inactivate viruses. This study evaluated UVGI effectiveness for viruses on the surface of gelatin-based medium in a UV exposure chamber. The effects of UV dose, viral nucleic acid type (single-stranded RNA, ssRNA; single-stranded DNA, ssDNA; double-stranded RNA, dsRNA; and double-stranded DNA, dsDNA), and relative humidity on the virus survival fraction were investigated. For 90% viral reduction, the UV dose was 1.32 to 3.20 mJ/cm(2) for ssRNA, 2.50 to to 4.47 mJ/cm(2) for ssDNA, 3.80 to 5.36 mJ/cm(2) for dsRNA, and 7.70 to 8.13 mJ/cm(2) for dsDNA. For all four tested viruses, the UV dose for 99% viral reduction was 2 times higher than those for 90% viral reduction. Viruses on a surface with single-stranded nucleic acid (ssRNA and ssDNA) were more susceptible to UV inactivation than viruses with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA and dsDNA). For the same viral reduction, the UV dose at 85% relative humidity (RH) was higher than that at 55% RH. In summary, results showed that UVGI was an effective method for inactivation of viruses on surfaces.","publish_time":"2007-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Chun-Chieh; Li, Chih-Shan","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196698.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UVGI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivation of viruses","viral reduction","UV inactivation","tested viruses","mJ","single-stranded RNA","effects of UV dose","double-stranded RNA","single-stranded DNA","double-stranded DNA","viral nucleic acid type","ssRNA","ssDNA","dsRNA","dsDNA","UV exposure chamber","increasing incidence of viral infections","relative humidity","UVGI effectiveness","RH","contaminated environmental surfaces","surface of gelatin","effective method","times higher","promising method","need","novel engineering control methods","agents","virus survival fraction","Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation","results","transmission","study","summary","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

These include the production of proteins derived from recombinant DNA yeast technology (aerobically grown Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These proteins include rennin, amyloglucosidases (glucamylases), interferons, interleukins, insulin, monoclonal antibodies, tissue plasminogen activators (t\u2010PA), sexually transmitted disease antigens, and measles, mumps and rubella antigens, growth hormones, somatotropin, blood clotting factors VIII and XIII. In addition, there may be a demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus antigens, hepatitis A, B and C viral\u2010selected antigens, HIV retroviral antigens, influenza antigens, trypanosomal antigens, and foot and mouth disease antigens. Prevention of oxidative stress has been achieved by application of antioxidant redox metalloenzymes such as superoxide dismutases (containing Cu/Zn cytosolic, Mn mitochondrial and Fe bacterial) glutathione peroxidases (and other Se\u2010containing proteins and enzymes such as the thioredoxins), catalases (Fe\u2010containing), cytochrome c peroxidases (Fe\u2010containing), ceruloplasmins (Cu\u2010containing), metallothionines (these cysteine thiol\u2010rich proteins bind ions of cadmium and mercury) and tyrosinases(Cu\u2010containing). Methods and Results: ROS are generated inadvertently by single metal valency couples such as FeII/FeIII and by FeIII/FeV present in 2700 (including 57 human) isoforms in cytochromes P450 mixed\u2010function oxidases (EC 1\u00B714\u00B714\u00B71; O(2) : mono\u2010oxygenase NADPH/NADH requiring). In addition, mixed\u2010metal couples such as valency unmatched forms in CuI/FeII and FeIII/MnIV can recycle electrons. Moreover, proteins/protein chaperone couples can recycle electrons, often where futile\u2010recycling systems have been instigated. Furthermore, oxidized membrane phospholipids (R) can form ROOH (lipid hydroperoxides) and ROH (lipid alkoxides) that can generate ROS through Fenton chemistry (iron\u2010catalysed) chain reactions. Utilization of chain\u2010breaking antioxidants such as vitamin E (\u03B1\u2010tocopherol) in the lipid phase and vitamin C (ascorbate) in the aqueous phase can terminate these ROS\u2010producing reactions. Conclusions: The main significance of the study is that proteomic strategies of relief from bioprocess perturbation by ROS of yeast fermentations (used to manufacture proteins required in the food and therapeutic bioindustries) may become possible through addition of selected proteins (including metalloenzymes). The main impact of the study is that the utilization of genetically modified (GM) yeast produced by recombinant DNA technology genomic strategies could circumvent the bioprocessing problems that otherwise result from the bioprocess perturbations: this is as a result of oxidative stress caused by ROS, which is avoidable by deployment of appropriate antioxidants such as vitamins E, C and D (and antioxidant proteins and enzymes often of microbial origin via recombinant DNA technology).","publish_time":"2004-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiseman, A.","journal":"Lett Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7800f3725aae71095bda01d35cc48f6bbdd78f16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ROH"],"organizations":["VIII","XIII","EC","GM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selected antigens","antioxidant proteins","coronavirus antigens","trypanosomal antigens","influenza antigens","rubella antigens","rich proteins","production of proteins","addition of selected proteins","transmitted disease antigens","mouth disease antigens","ROS of yeast fermentations","HIV retroviral antigens","recombinant DNA yeast technology","vitamin C","FeIII","Bioprocess oxidative stress","result of oxidative stress","C viral","metal couples","lipid phase","recombinant DNA technology genomic strategies","cytochrome c peroxidases","Prevention of oxidative stress","Fe bacterial","single metal valency couples","lipid hydroperoxides","lipid alkoxides","vitamin E","irreversible perturbation of yeast bioprocesses","study","electrons","bioprocess perturbations","Utilization of chain","chain reactions","protein chaperone couples","breaking antioxidants","vitamins E","glutathione peroxidases","application of antioxidant redox metalloenzymes","aqueous phase","main significance","main impact","valency unmatched forms","proteomic strategies of relief","deployment of appropriate antioxidants","growth hormones","Mn mitochondrial","monoclonal antibodies","somatotropin","Zn cytosolic","hepatitis","mumps","tissue plasminogen activators","severe acute respiratory syndrome","superoxide dismutases","microbial origin","insulin","CuI","measles","ascorbate","foot","cytochromes P450","ions of cadmium","interferons","interleukins","ROOH","demand","glucamylases","cysteine thiol","ROH","mercury","iron","tocopherol","reactive oxygen species","blood clotting factors","function oxidases","human","isoforms","metallothionines","therapeutic bioindustries","amyloglucosidases","bioprocessing problems","MnIV","thioredoxins","GM","Fenton chemistry","FeV present","oxidized membrane phospholipids","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","oxygenase NADPH","NADH","tyrosinases","food","rennin","recycling systems","Conclusions","catalases","Methods","Results","ceruloplasmins"],"language":"en"},

The etiological agents responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases have not been identified. We sought to determine whether novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are circulating in New Haven, Connecticut, and, if so, whether they are associated with respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Methods. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach for screening specimens from the respiratory tracts of symptomatic children. PCR probes that target regions of the replicase 1a gene that are conserved among genetically diverse animal CoVs and HCoVs were designed. Using these probes, we identified genomic sequences of a novel HCoV, designated \u201CNew Haven coronavirus\u201D (HCoV-NH). Thereafter, we designed specific probes to screen respiratory specimens from children \u003C5 years old for this novel HCoV. Clinical features associated with HCoV-NH infection were identified. Results. Seventy-nine (8.8%) of 895 children tested positive for HCoV-NH. Cough, rhinorrhea, tachypnea, fever, abnormal breath sounds, and hypoxia were the most common findings associated with HCoV-NH infection. Sequence analysis revealed that HCoV-NH is closely related to a novel HCoV recently reported in The Netherlands. Conclusions. The novel HCoVs identified in New Haven and The Netherlands are similar and likely represent the same species. This newly discovered virus may have worldwide distribution and may account for a significant proportion of respiratory tract disease in infants and young children.","publish_time":"2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esper, Frank; Weibel, Carla; Ferguson, David; Landry, Marie L.; Kahn, Jeffrey S.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac74aabd90f74c3610e34efe5d77f3c9c717899.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["The Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NH infection","novel HCoVs","respiratory specimens","young children","respiratory tracts of symptomatic children","significant proportion of respiratory tract disease","PCR probes","substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases","New Haven coronavirus","novel human coronaviruses","infants","specific probes","Netherlands","screening specimens","tachypnea","fever","based approach","abnormal breath sounds","years old","hypoxia","common findings","etiological agents responsible","rhinorrhea","polymerase chain reaction","regions","genomic sequences","worldwide distribution","diverse animal CoVs","Clinical features","discovered virus","gene","Cough","replicase","Sequence analysis","Connecticut","species","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Many pathogens manipulate the ubiquitin system to evade these defenses. Here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase (DUB) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus. The Ulp1-like DUB prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the DUB (OtDUB) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site, the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity, undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented ~5 nM dissociation constant. The characterization and high-resolution structure determination of this enzyme should aid in its development as a drug target to counter Orientia infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berk, Jason M.; Lim, Christopher; Ronau, Judith A.; Chaudhuri, Apala; Chen, Hongli; Beckmann, John F.; Loria, J.

Furthermore, natural disasters (e.g. heat waves, severe storms, floods and large forest fires) are becoming more frequent. The impact of global warming and climate change on health involves an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and cognitive mental diseases. Furthermore, a change in the frequency and patterns of infectious diseases can also be observed in Europe. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article presents the most important studies that investigated diseases associated with the climate change, with special reference to those that represent a challenge for intensive care medicine. RESULTS: Currently available epidemiological data and statistical extrapolations indicate that diseases resulting from the climate change (acute infection-related respiratory and intestinal diseases, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions, heat-related dehydration, cerebral insults and myocardial infarction) are relevant for intensive care medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on a significant increase in acute kidney damage during heat waves. A previously unknown pattern of infectious diseases necessitates new knowledge and targeted management. In some studies, persisting mental impairments were registered during heat waves and natural disasters, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Intensive care medicine must be prepared for the challenges due to global warming and climate change. Slow but continuous changes (e.g. rise in temperature) as well as acute changes (e.g. heat waves and natural disasters) will induce an increased need for intensive medical care services (e.g. an increase in the need for renal replacement procedures). Intensive care physicians will need to be familiar with the diagnostics and management of diseases associated with the climate change. An initiative of the specialist societies involved would be welcomed.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bein, T.; Karagiannidis, C.; Gr\u00FCndling, M.; Quintel, M.","journal":"Anaesthesist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f7f10e1f6eaa8e23ef83f6d61d2a2f13e715776.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["climate change","heat waves","management of diseases","intensive care medicine","intestinal diseases","Intensive care physicians","patterns of infectious diseases","cognitive mental diseases","continuous increase","natural disasters","intensive medical care services","unknown pattern of infectious diseases","heat-related dehydration","significant increase","acute changes","acute infection-related respiratory","average global temperature","impact of global warming","increased need","continuous changes","acute kidney damage","targeted management","mental impairments","important studies","renal replacement procedures","exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions","myocardial infarction","floods","severe storms","cerebral insults","new knowledge","health","large forest fires","available epidemiological data","statistical extrapolations","posttraumatic stress disorder","article","decades","frequency","challenges","special reference","RESULTS","diagnostics","CONCLUSION","Particular emphasis","initiative","specialist societies","MATERIAL","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Europe"],"language":"en"},

We validate the proposed criterion applying it to different epidemic models, with waning immunity or heterogeneous infection rates in both synthetic and real SF networks.

The aim of the present study was to determine the pattern of airway inflammation in atopic and nonatopic children with chronic cough, and to investigate whether atopy is a predictive factor for eosinophilic inflammation in cough. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; three aliquots of 1 ml/kg saline) was performed in the right middle lobe of 24 (11 atopic and 13 nonatopic) children with persistent cough (8 females, 16 males), mean age 4.7 years (range: 1\u201311). Atopy was defined as an elevated total serum IgE or a positive RAST test. Both atopic and nonatopic children with persistent cough had an increase in total cells/ml in BAL (atopic: median 39 \u00D7 10(4), range: 20\u2013123; nonatopic: median 22 \u00D7 10(4), range: 17\u2013132) compared to nonatopic controls (median 11 \u00D7 10(4), range 9\u201330). The increases were mainly in neutrophils (atopic: median 17%, range 2.5\u201388.5%; nonatopic: median 6%, range 1.0\u201355.0%) compared to controls (median 1.55%, range 0.5\u20137.0%; atopics vs. controls, P \u003C 0.005). There were no significant increases in eosinophils, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, or mast cells. Eosinophils were elevated in only 5/11 atopic and none of the nonatopic children. The increased percentage of neutrophils in the BAL fluid of atopic and nonatopic children with persistent cough could be due to an underlying inflammatory process driving the cough, or even conceivably, due to the effect of coughing itself. In this highly selected series, the absence of eosinophilic inflammation in the majority suggests that most would be predicted not to respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.

Many adult patients will develop progressive hypoxia, and a large proportion will develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), possibly related to massive and uncontrolled activation of the immune system. The mortality has been reported to be quite high, especially in the elderly with comorbid conditions. The causative agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus, and children appear to acquire the infection by close\u2010contact household exposure to an infected adult. However, the severity is much milder and the clinical progression much less aggressive in young children. The exact pathophysiology of SARS is still unclear, and the medical treatment of SARS remains controversial. The main treatment regime used in Hong Kong is a combination of ribavirin and steroid. To date, there have been no reported case fatalities in children with this disease. The success of reducing the burden of this infection in children will depend on proper isolation of infected adults early in the course of illness. Strict public health policy and quarantine measures are the key in controlling the infection in the community.

METHODS: Proteins differently expressed in the two cell\u2010lines were identified by two\u2010dimensional (2\u2010D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. HSP60, more abundant in LNCaP\u2010r, was studied by RT\u2010PCR and immunohistochemistry in specimens of human prostate cancer. RESULTS: HSP60 was upregulated in LNCaP\u2010r, nm23 in LNCaP\u2010FGC, and titin (two isoforms) in either LNCaP\u2010r or LNCaP\u2010FGC.

In particular, areas of Jeju Island with extensive swine production have faced repeated epidemics since the re\u2010emergence in 2014. The current study reports the complete genome sequences and molecular characterization of the representative PEDV strains responsible for the 2018 endemic outbreaks on Jeju Island. All isolates were determined to belong genetically to the highly pathogenic pandemic G2b group. Full\u2010length genome sizes of four isolates differed from that of the G2b epidemic field strain due to insertion or deletion (DEL) mutations in the non\u2010structural protein (nsp)\u2010 or spike (S) protein\u2010coding regions. The 2018 Jeju isolates shared 96.7%\u201398.7% and 98.5%\u201399.4% identity at the S gene and whole\u2010genome levels, respectively, compared to global G2b PEDV strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 2018 isolates were closest to the 2014 G2b re\u2010emergent Jeju strains, but appeared to have undergone substantial rapid independent evolution. Among the isolates, a notable nsp3 DEL variant strain, KOR/KNU\u20101807/2018, was isolated and propagated by continuous passages in Vero cells, and displayed typical PEDV\u2010induced syncytia formation. Genomic sequencing identified a unique 8\u2010nt DEL in the extreme C\u2010terminal region of the S gene at the 4th passage (KNU\u20101807\u2010P4) compared to its original sample. This DEL resulted in the premature termination of S by nine amino acid residues (EVFEKVHVQ), which contained a KxHxx motif that is a potential endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal. In vivo animal studies showed that variant strain KNU\u20101807 had decreased virulence in suckling piglets. These results advance our knowledge regarding the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the G2b PEDV endemic strains prevalent in Jeju swine herds in South Korea.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sunhee; Lee, Dong\u2010Uk; Noh, Yun\u2010Hee; Lee, Seung\u2010Chul; Choi, Hwan\u2010Won; Yang, Hyoung\u2010Seok; Seol, Jun\u2010Ho; Mun, Seong Hwan; Kang, Won\u2010Myoung; Yoo, Hyekyung; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36209acb36d54e3781a460cc8cfe0f2570f7f075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["South Korea","Jeju Island","Jeju"],"keyphrases":["Jeju isolates","global G2b PEDV strains","G2b PEDV endemic strains prevalent","G2b re\u2010emergent Jeju strains","pandemic strains","typical PEDV","representative PEDV strains responsible","G2b epidemic field","S gene","Jeju swine herds","areas of Jeju Island","variant strain KNU","pathogenic pandemic G2b group","South Korea","virulent G2b porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","endemic outbreaks","premature termination of S","genome levels","complete genome sequences","Full\u2010length genome sizes","genetic variation","non\u2010structural protein","extensive swine production","scale regional outbreaks","molecular characterization","pathogenicity","potential endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal","mutations","repeated epidemics","amino acid residues","Vero cells","terminal region","insertion","spike","notable nsp3","extreme C","continuous passages","KxHxx motif","EVFEKVHVQ","knowledge","P4","current study","induced syncytia formation","virulence","incursion","animal studies","coding regions","substantial rapid independent evolution","deletion","phylogenetic analyses","Genomic sequencing","original sample","suckling piglets","re\u2010emergence","results","identity"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of 329 patients with severe acute pancreatitis from January 2014 to February 2019. We compared baseline characteristics, laboratory data, severity scores, types of persistent organ failure, and primary and secondary outcomes of patients with and without elevated arterial lactate levels at admission. A multivariate logistic regression analysis model and receiver operating characteristic curve were adopted to evaluate the value of arterial lactate \u22654 mmol/L for identifying high-risk patients. Trends in arterial lactate levels were compared between patients in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups over a period of 7 days. RESULTS: Compared to normal arterial lactate levels, patients with elevated arterial lactate levels show significantly higher incidences of multiple persistent organ failure (3% vs 30%, P \u003C 0.01), death (2% vs 11%, P \u003C 0.01), septic shock (4% vs 24%, P \u003C 0.01), pancreatic infection (12% vs 37%, P \u003C 0.01), abdominal compartment syndrome (3% vs 20%, P \u003C 0.01), pancreatic necrosis (41% vs 63%, P \u003C 0.01), and a need for ventilator support (26% vs 54%, P \u003C 0.01). For predicting mortality, arterial lactate levels \u22654 mmol/L had a high hazard ratio (10, 95% CI; 3.7\u201327; P \u003C 0.01) and the highest area under the curve (0.78).

This article reviews information linking HRV infection to illness in the lower respiratory tract. HRVs are capable of efficient replication in vitro at temperatures present in the tracheobronchial tree and have been shown to cause productive infection, elaboration of cytokines and chemokines, and up\u2010regulation of cell surface markers in human bronchial epithelial cells. In situ hybridisation studies have proven that HRV infection occurs in the tracheobronchial tree following experimental infection. Clinical studies report that HRV infection is the second most frequently recognised agent associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children and commonly causes exacerbations of pre\u2010existing airways disease in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis. HRV infection is associated with one\u2010third to one\u2010half of asthma exacerbations depending on age and is linked to asthma hospitalisations in both adults and children. Limited information implicates HRV infection as a cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in older adults and in highly immunocompromised hosts, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients. More information is needed about the pathogenesis of HRV infection with regard to lower respiratory tract complications in these diverse patient groups. Given the large unmet medical need associated with HRV infections, safe and effective antiviral agents are needed for both prevention and treatment of these infections.

Procedure Information was obtained from medical records for affected cats, including age, sex, clinical signs, management, and outcome, with histopathology re\u2010examined. Results Six of seven cats presented with unilateral orbital involvement that progressed to bilateral orbital disease despite treatment. Onset was insidious, evolving over weeks to months and was associated with fixation of orbital structures. Owners of six of the cats opted for euthanasia because of disease progression and pain. Histopathology of affected orbital tissue included extensive fibrosis with encapsulation of normal tissues without characteristics of neoplasia. Conclusions Clinical findings and histopathology of globes and orbital tissues in cats bore many similarities to idiopathic sclerosing orbital pseudotumor in humans.

Specifically, through approaching Fukushima as a cosmopolitical event we gain insight into the complex processes of normalizing social relations. Moreover, the Fukushima event and its effects demand to extend the history of the sociological imagination to the social and political relevance of the non\u2010human.

Methods We searched PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library for articles published before June 2004 in all languages. We had searched reference lists of all primary and review articles. Studies were included in the review if they reported the impact of an intervention to promote hand cleansing on respiratory infections. Studies relating to hospital\u2010acquired infections, long\u2010term care facilities, immuno\u2010compromised and elderly people were excluded. We independently evaluated all studies, and inclusion decisions were reached by consensus. From a primary list of 410 articles, eight interventional studies met the eligibility criteria. Results All eight eligible studies reported that handwashing lowered risks of respiratory infection, with risk reductions ranging from 6% to 44% [pooled value 24% (95% CI 6\u201340%)]. Pooling the results of only the seven homogenous studies gave a relative risk of 1.19 (95% CI 1.12%\u20131.26%), implying that hand cleansing can cut the risk of respiratory infection by 16% (95% CI 11\u201321%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of per\u2010unit and per\u2010patient aggregate infectious risks for conventional RBCs were calculated; the latter used patient diagnosis as a determinant of estimated lifetime exposure to RBC units. Existing in vitro data for the two technologies under development for producing PI\u2010RBCs and the status of current clinical trials are reviewed. RESULTS: Minimum and maximum per\u2010unit risk were calculated as 0.0003% (1 in 323,000) and 0.12% (1 in 831), respectively. The minimum estimate is for known lower\u2010risk pathogens while the maximal estimate also includes an emerging infectious agent (EIA) and endemic area Babesia risk. Minimum and maximum per\u2010patient lifetime risks by diagnosis grouping were estimated as 1.5 and 3.3%, respectively, for stem cell transplantation (which includes additional risk for cytomegalovirus transmission); 1.2 and 3.7%, respectively, for myelodysplastic syndrome; and 0.2 and 44%, respectively, for hemoglobinopathy. DISCUSSION: There is potential for PI technologies to reduce infectious RBC risk and to provide additional benefits (e.g., prevention of transfusion\u2010associated graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease and possible reduction of alloimmunization) due to white blood cell inactivation. PI\u2010RBCs should be viewed in the context of having a fully PI\u2010treated blood supply, enabling a blood safety paradigm shift from reactive to proactive. Providing insurance against new EIAs. Further, when approved, the use of PI for all components may catalyze operational changes in blood donor screening, laboratory testing, and component manufacturing.","publish_time":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleinman, Steve; Stassinopoulos, Adonis","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/550e9853ed0cee5b858076cdeb5b193b4b607a6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBC","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious RBC risk","PI technologies","additional risk","unit risk","use of PI","Red blood cell","risk pathogens","white blood cell inactivation","patient lifetime risks","RBC units","patient aggregate infectious risks","transfusion risks","patient diagnosis","conventional RBCs","minimum estimate","blood donor screening","treated blood supply","pathogen inactivation of RBC","blood safety paradigm shift","endemic area Babesia risk","maximum","emerging infectious agent","stem cell transplantation","additional benefits","maximal estimate","determinant of estimated lifetime exposure","prevention of transfusion","diagnosis grouping","laboratory testing","host disease","operational changes","possible reduction of alloimmunization","associated graft","components","robust technology","status of current clinical trials","development","BACKGROUND","component manufacturing","METHODS","Estimates","data","cytomegalovirus transmission","insurance","new EIAs","MATERIALS","DISCUSSION","RESULTS","context","myelodysplastic syndrome","hemoglobinopathy"],"language":"en"},

Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON-1 and NA-2 in a neonatal intensive care unit in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus-A (ten and 14 with ON-1 and NA-2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961 g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON-1 and NA-2 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Fl\u00E1via Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; S\u00E1fadi, Marco Aur\u00E9lio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalh\u00E3es, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman","journal":"J Pediatr (Rio J)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e538f1f513ab9cc857c20e364232ec9a677288e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus detection","consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks","respiratory viruses","infants","neonatal intensive care units","better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology","abrupt respiratory symptoms","nosocomial outbreaks","different outbreaks","mean age","nosocomial transmission","mean gestational age","genotypes","total","molecular epidemiology data","mean birth weight","lung disease","heart disease","absence of severe symptoms","new vaccines","patients","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","symptomatic newborns","antiviral drugs","S\u00E3o Paulo","days","prospective search","pathogen","Risk factors","infection control measures","prematurity","Brazil","authors","index case","Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples","weeks","METHODS","studies","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","Genotyping","nucleotide sequencing","mechanical ventilation","groups","Coinfections","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrate here that intravenous administration of low doses of anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 results in IL-4 production within 60 min of stimulation as demonstrated by Northern analysis of mRNA and a sensitive, selective bioassay (CT.4S cell proliferation) of biologically active IL-4 protein. Production of IL-4 is paralleled by IFN\u03B3 synthesis, displaying similar kinetics. These findings, consistent with the presence of mature cells capable of IL-4 and IFN\u03B3 synthesis in the T cell repertoire of naive mice, are supported by the observation that stimulation of spleen cells from naive mice with anti-CD3 mAb in vitro for 12 h also results in strong IL-4 and IFN\u03B3 mRNA and protein synthesis. The data support and extend those obtained through analysis of cytokine mRNA synthesis alone, thereby providing evidence that \u201Cfresh\u201D T cells are indeed capable of producing IL-4 directly ex vivo and are consistent with the existence of IL-4-secreting cells as a normal component of the T cell repertoire of naive mice.","publish_time":"1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hui; Mohapatra, Shyam S.; HayGlass, Kent T.","journal":"Immunol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2360a2ebe43e316843477606bc29fb045999e7a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existence of IL","Production of IL","secreting T cells","active IL","strong IL","studies of IL","presence of mature cells capable of IL","T cell repertoire of naive mice","lymphokine-secreting cells","stimulation of spleen cells","IFN\u03B3 synthesis","secreting cell frequencies","IFN\u03B3 mRNA","protein synthesis","analysis of cytokine mRNA synthesis","S cell proliferation","normal component","Northern analysis of mRNA","2C11 results","similar kinetics","intravenous administration of low doses of anti-CD3 mAb","data support","selective bioassay","following immunization of experimental animals","evidence","IgE responses","restimulation","mitogen","Ag","observation","potential","days of culture","secretors","form of precursors","findings","time"],"language":"en"},

The interesting effect of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) system involving viral antigens in cell killing is also presented. Multiple additional topics are also covered, such as the effect of antibody on the expression of viral proteins both on the surface of the cell and intracellularly. Serum antibody, produced in response to virus infections, is of major importance in preventing the spread of infection by virtue of neutralizing free virus in extracellular fluids. Virus neutralization by antibody is enhanced by complement. Antibody binding to the surface of virus-infected cells can affect virus production and release in the absence of an effector system. Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody can mediate the destruction of virus-infected cells in conjunction with complement or cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, at a conceptual level there is evidence to suggest that antibody may enhance and confer specificity on basic nonspecific humoral and cell-mediated defense mechanisms.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sissons, J.G.

Polymyxins are considered as last-resort drugs for CRAB infections, but there is still controversy regarding the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. The present systematic review was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies versus non-polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov to identify eligible studies reporting the clinical outcomes of patients with CRAB infections. The meta-analysis employed a random-effects model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was 1-month mortality for any cause. We also examined clinical response, microbiological response, length of stay in hospital, and adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were analyzed (1052 patients in total), including 2 randomized clinical trials. Serious risk of bias was found in 8 out of the 11 studies. There was no statistically significant difference between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies in 1-month mortality for any cause (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.53), microbiological response (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 0.90 to 16.29) and length of stay in hospital (SMD, 0.24; 95% CI, \u2212 0.08 to 0.56). The pooled OR of clinical response indicated a significant difference in favor of polymyxin based therapies (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03). The pooled OR of adverse events showed that non-polymyxins based therapies were associated with fewer adverse events (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.39 to 13.48). CONCLUSION: The performance of polymyxins based therapies was better than non-polymyxin based therapies in clinical response rate and similar to non-polymyxin based therapies in terms of 1-month mortality and microbiological response in treating CRAB infections. Due to the limitations of our study, we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the optimal treatment of CRAB infections, but polymyxins would be a relatively effective treatment for CRAB infections. Adequate and well-designed large scale randomized controlled trials are required to clarify the relative efficacy of polymyxins based and non-polymyxins based therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyu, Cheng; Zhang, Yuyi; Liu, Xiaofen; Wu, Jufang; Zhang, Jing","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbff066dfbabcc27592db0c44b5df6fa53366901.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRAB","clinicaltrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapies","non-polymyxins","safety of polymyxins","performance of polymyxins","relative efficacy of polymyxins","optimal treatment of CRAB infections","microbiological response","prevalence of infections","clinical response rate","month mortality","randomized clinical trials","clinical outcomes of patients","significant difference","eligible studies","fewer adverse events","favor of polymyxin","SMD","length","hospital","cause","standardized mean difference","effective treatment","controlled trials","firm conclusion","systematic literature search","present systematic review","Embase","PubMed","random-effects model","CINAHL","well-designed large scale","carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii","terms","odds ratio","Cochrane Library","meta-analysis","resort drugs","primary outcome","confidence interval","total","controversy","Serious risk of bias","study","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","limitations","rise"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes, and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients. RESULTS: In total, 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders, multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.824, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.279\u20136.414; P \u003C 0.001), admittance to intensive care unit (aOR: 1.630, 95% CI: 1.074\u20132.473, P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (aOR: 2.427, 95% CI: 1.568\u20133.756, P \u003C 0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637, 95% CI: 1.134\u20136.131, P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of illness and clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients are more severe than FluB-p.

The mechanism of their cytotoxic activity has been also examined by immunoassaying the levels of key anti- and proapoptotic protein markers. The analytical and spectral data of the all synthesized target congeners were compatible with their structures. Synthesized compounds showed diverse moderate to powerful antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results of MTT assay revealed that seven synthesized compounds (i.e., 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b, 13b, 13c and 13h) particularly exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the three cancerous cell lines under investigation. Ranges of IC(50) values obtained were 5.7\u201321.3 and 5.8\u201337.4 \u00B5g/mL against HCT-116 and MCF-7, respectively; which is 3.8 and 6.5-fold (based on the least IC(50) values) more significant relative to the reference chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In HepG-2 cells, the analogue 13h exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC(50) value of 19.2\u00B5g/mL relative to doxorubicin (IC(50) = 21.6\u00B5g/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was specific to cancerous cells, as evidenced by the minimal toxicity in the noncancerous control skin-fibroblast cells. ELISA results indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect against examined cancer cell lines is mediated via engaging the activation of apoptosis as illustrated by the significant increase in proapoptotic protein markers (p53, bax and caspase-3) and reduction in the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2.

One hundred fifty (57.6%) nasal aspirates were found DFA\u2010positive; 188 (72.3%) were found positive by both DFA and HuH7 cell culture, and 242 (92%) were PCR\u2010positive. The m\u2010PCR detected 124 viruses which were not found by conventional methods: 68 rhinovirus, 17 human metapneumovirus, 15 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 8 parainfluenza virus (PIV), 5 coronavirus 229E, 3 OC43 and 3 NL63, 4 enterovirus, 2 influenza virus B and C virus. The m\u2010PCR were more sensitive, had the advantages of a shorter delay in specific diagnosis, and a lower cost than DFA and culture. Using these m\u2010PCR, the prevalence of each virus was compared between in\u2010patient and out\u2010patient groups of children attending the emergency unit of the hospital. Nasal aspirates from 411 (91.5%) children were found positive by the PCRs. RSV, rhinovirus, and influenza virus were the most frequent viruses detected in this population, representing 43.6%, 31.8%, and 8.8% of the virus found, respectively, followed by human metapneumovirus (4.4%), coronavirus (3.4%), parainfluenza virus (3.2%), adenovirus (2.3%), and enterovirus (2.1%). RSVs were detected more significantly in the in\u2010patient group than in the out\u2010patient group, and influenza viruses were detected more frequently in the out\u2010patient group than in the in\u2010patient group. Moreover, the use of m\u2010PCR pointed out the frequency of rhinovirus and mixed viral detections in these patients. In conclusion, according to the requirements of speed and low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of DFA and m\u2010PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.

We reviewed the literature on infectious diseases of 34 large (maximum body mass of adults \u003E20 kg) terrestrial carnivore species, 18 of which are considered to be threatened in the wild, and examined reports of antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) and cases of infection, mortality and population decline. Of 52 diseases examined, 44% were viral, 31% bacterial and the remainder were protozoal or fungal. Many infections were endemic in carnivores and/or infected multiple taxonomic families, with the majority probably occurring via inhalation or ingestion. Most disease studies consisted of serological surveys for disease antibodies, and antibody detection tended to be widespread implying that exposure to micro\u2010organisms was common. Seroprevalence was higher in tropical than temperate areas, and marginally higher for infections known to occur in multiple carnivore groups. Confirmation of active infection via micro\u2010organism recovery was less common for ursids than other taxonomic groups. Published descriptions of disease\u2010induced population decline or extinction were rare, and most outbreaks were allegedly the result of direct transmission of rabies or canine distemper virus (CDV) from abundant carnivore species to less\u2010common large carnivores. We conclude that the threat of disease epidemics in large carnivores may be serious if otherwise lethal infections are endemic in reservoir hosts and transmitted horizontally among taxa. To prevent or mitigate future population declines, research efforts should be aimed at identifying both the diseases of potential importance to large carnivores and the ecological conditions associated with their spread and severity.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Dennis L.; Kapke, Cynthia A.; Evermann, James F.; Fuller, Todd K.","journal":"Anim Conserv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82e05910678ab686bbec30bafb2aff27959df852.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159380/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common large carnivores","disease antibodies","disease studies","diseases of potential importance","multiple carnivore groups","induced population","threat of disease epidemics","future population declines","Published descriptions of disease","abundant carnivore species","lethal infections","seroprevalence","devastating effect of infectious diseases","terrestrial carnivore species","taxonomic groups","antibody detection","cases of infection","vital importance","recent declines","infected multiple taxonomic families","reports of antibody prevalence","Confirmation of active infection","CDV","canine distemper virus","micro\u2010organism recovery","result of direct transmission of rabies","widespread implying","serological surveys","maximum body mass of adults","ecosystems","populations","integrity","majority","reservoir hosts","temperate areas","extinction","ursids","ecological conditions","outbreaks","stability","exposure","micro\u2010organisms","research efforts","mortality","remainder","conservation","literature","inhalation","ingestion","severity","taxa"],"language":"en"},

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was transmitted to 6\u2010day\u2010old piglets by dosing with homogenates of muscle and lymph node collected from 500 clinically normal pigs at the time of slaughter. All piglets in 2 separately housed litters showed clinical signs of TGE with 5 piglets dying within 10 d of oral dosing with homogenates. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was isolated from 2 of these piglets and all piglets developed TGE antibody. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was not isolated in tissue culture from muscle and lymph node homogenates, but was isolated from 4 (0.8%) of 500 tonsil samples collected from the same pigs. A survey of 250 serum samples provided an estimate of the prevalence of slaughtered pigs with TGE antibody of 34.8% in the sample population. The results indicate that carcases of some pigs from TGE endemic areas contain viable TGE virus, and that there would be a substantial risk of introducing TGE virus into Australia by the importation of uncooked pig meat from these areas.","publish_time":"2008-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"COOK, DR; HILL, HT; TAYLOR, JD","journal":"Aust Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01202cc48c572362da7e237ba6e80d0f48471f19.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","TGE"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["viable TGE virus","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","TGE antibody","TGE endemic areas","clinical signs of TGE","normal pigs","carcases of slaughtered pigs","day\u2010old piglets","prevalence of slaughtered pigs","homogenates of muscle","lymph node homogenates","serum samples","tonsil samples","d of oral dosing","Australia","tissue culture","importation of uncooked pig meat","estimate","housed litters","substantial risk","time of slaughter","USA","study","survey","results","sample population","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

The curved bacteria grew only on media containing blood, in an atmosphere of approximately 10% air, 10% CO(2) and 80% H(2). They were Gram\u2010negative, with a polar flagellum at one or both ends, they did not ferment glucose or give a positive catalase reaction.

Therefore, our primary aim was to compare the concentration of l\u2010lactate to the concentration of neutrophils in sputum and systemic markers of infection. Because it is difficult to differentiate viral and bacterial infection on the basis of clinical presentation in LRTI, our secondary aim was to evaluate if l\u2010 and d\u2010lactate may serve as markers of local inflammation as representatives of neutrophils and bacteria, respectively. METHODS: Patients with acute LRTI were prospectively recruited. Sputum samples were collected and analysed for neutrophil count, l\u2010lactate and d\u2010lactate. We had data on pathogens from sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (atypical bacteria, virus) and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) from blood. RESULTS: In 44 sputum samples from 32 patients, the median (interquartile range (IQR)) sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.615 \u00D7 10(7) cells/mL (0.236\u20131.575). The sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was associated with sputum l\u2010lactate (p = 0.011) and CRP (p = 0.018), but not with d\u2010lactate (p = 0.177). There was a strong association between sputum d\u2010lactate and l\u2010lactate (p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSION: As l\u2010lactate in sputum is closely correlated to sequestration of neutrophils in the lungs, l\u2010lactate is a marker for local inflammation in LRTI and a potential biomarker in clinical management of LRTI. On expectorated sputum, d\u2010lactate had no clinical relevance.","publish_time":"2019-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fredman, Gabriella; Kolpen, Mette; Hertz, Frederik Boetius; Petersen, Pelle Trier; Jensen, Andreas Vestergaard; Baunb\u00E6k\u2010Egelund, Gertrud; Ravn, Pernille; Jensen, Peter \u00D8strup; Faurholt\u2010Jepsen, Daniel","journal":"APMIS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4f730028f2322aa3828771bca1dadec52a86f02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lactate","sputum d","Sputum samples","sputum cultures","expectorated sputum","sputum neutrophil granulocyte count","clinical management of LRTI","acute LRTI","neutrophil count","concentration of neutrophils","markers of local inflammation","clinical relevance","Patients","representatives of neutrophils","sequestration of neutrophils","CRP","lungs","basis of clinical presentation","systemic markers of infection","atypical bacteria","bacterial infection","secondary aim","primary aim","PCR","IQR","polymerase chain reaction","potential biomarker","virus","interquartile range","reactive protein","median","pathogens","Lower respiratory tract infections","strong association","blood","data","METHODS","response of biomarkers","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","cells"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed in the livers of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (n = 15) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 15). Bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation was performed in wild-type (WT) and Caspase-1(\u2013/\u2013) (Casp1(\u2013/\u2013)) mice for 7 days. Mouse hepatocytes and macrophages were treated with bile acids. RESULTS: Caspase-1, NLRP1, NLRP3 and IL-1\u03B2 were significantly increased in the livers of cholestatic patients when compared to healthy control subjects (n = 9). Significantly higher levels of plasma IL-1\u03B2 (826 vs 345 pg/ml), ALT (674 vs 482 U/L) and ALP (900 vs 622 U/L) were seen in WT BDL mice compared to Casp1(\u2013/\u2013) BDL mice. Caspase-1 cleavage was found only in WT BDL livers. Assessment of liver histology indicated more fibrosis in Casp1(\u2013/\u2013) BDL mice than in WT BDL mice, confirmed by analyses of liver hydroxyproline content and the expression of fibrotic genes. Profiling of immune cells revealed that there were more macrophages in Casp1(\u2013/\u2013) BDL livers than in WT BDL livers. Further macrophage phenotype characterization indicated that Casp1(\u2013/\u2013) BDL livers had more M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages evidenced by more CD206 positive cells and higher expression of IL-4, CD163, Fizz1 and IL-33. When mouse hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages were exposed to cholestatic levels of major endogenous bile acids (300\u03BCM TCA), neither IL-1\u03B2 induction nor procaspase-1 cleavage were detected.

Since then, structure\u2013function studies of SARS\u2010CoV proteins have provided a wealth of information that increases our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS. While no effective therapy is currently available, considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent SARS\u2010CoV infection. In this review, some of the notable achievements made by SARS structural biology projects worldwide are examined and strategies for therapeutic intervention are discussed based on available SARS\u2010CoV protein structures. To date, 12 structures have been determined by X\u2010ray crystallography or NMR from the 28 proteins encoded by SARS\u2010CoV. One key protein, the SARS\u2010CoV main protease (M (pro)), has been the focus of considerable structure\u2010based drug discovery efforts. This article highlights the importance of structural biology and shows that structures for drug design can be rapidly determined in the event of an emerging infectious disease.","publish_time":"2008-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartlam, Mark; Xue, Xiaoyu; Rao, Zihe","journal":"Acta Crystallogr A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f555ecae8895237f296f18a84704df8d0cc7b4e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available SARS","CoV proteins","function studies of SARS","underlying mechanisms of SARS","CoV protein structures","SARS structural biology projects","CoV infection","CoV main protease","considerable efforts","based drug discovery efforts","importance of structural biology","focus of considerable structure","drug design","key protein","notable achievements","understanding","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","strategies","drugs","economic impacts","X\u2010ray crystallography","wealth of information","therapeutic intervention","effective therapy","event","emerging infectious disease","NMR","article","vaccines","unknown coronavirus","review","date"],"language":"en"},

An oligo\u2010based microarray was employed to analyse mRNAs from rhabdomyosarcoma cells infected with the MS/7423/87 strain of enterovirus 71 (EV71) at 20 h post infection. Using Acuity software and LOWESS normalization, 152 genes were found to be downregulated while 39 were upregulated by greater than twofold. Altered transcripts include those encoding components of cytoskeleton, protein translation and modification; cellular transport proteins; protein degradation mediators; cell death mediators; mitochondrial\u2010related and metabolism proteins; cellular receptors and signal transducers. Changes in expression profiles of 15 representative genes were authenticated by real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), which also compared the transcriptional responses of cells infected with EV71 strain 5865/Sin/000009 isolated from a fatal case during the Singapore outbreak in 2000. Western blot analyses of APOB, CLU, DCAMKL1 and ODC1 proteins correlated protein and transcript levels.

Interestingly, doublecortin and CaM kinase\u2010like 1 (DCAMKL1) involved in brain development, was highly expressed during infection. Thus, microarray, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and proteomic analyses can elucidate the global view of the numerous and complex cellular responses that contribute towards EV71 pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2005-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leong, Wai Fook; Chow, Vincent T.

Five species of psyllid occurred on seven species of Salix at Meade River, Alaska. Studies were made on the two common species Psylla pclmeni L\u00F6w and P.phlebophyllae Hodkinson.

Both P.palmeni and P.phlebophyllae had a 1\u2010year life cycle and nymphal development took place on the female Salix catkin. The life cycle was generally closely synchronized with the period of catkin development. However, only a few eggs were laid on S.glauca 3. Seasonal perturbation of the host plant by flooding, ice movement and blown sand prevented psyllids breeding in certain areas colonized by the host plant. 4. In P.palmenidensities and \u2018feeding pressure\u2019, measured as biomass of psyllids per gram of catkin, on the different host plants followed the sequence S.pulchra\u003ES.lanata\u003E S.alaxensis \u003E S.glauca.

A highly significant negative correlation was found between psyllid density and catkin dry weight in S.pulchra, S.phlebophylla and S.reticulata, suggesting that psyllid feeding is affecting catkin growth. 6. Predation of psyllid nymphs by syrphid larvae was heavy but there was no evidence of parasitism. 7. The life history strategies of the five psyllid species are discussed within the context of the constraints imposed by the arctic environment.","publish_time":"2008-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"HODKINSON, I.

This enzyme accounts for more than 15.6% of the total gut proteins. After being solubilized in detergent, APN was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a glycoprotein rich in mannose residues, which binds the entomotoxic lectins of the concanavalin family. The internal sequence of APN is homologous with a conservative domain in APNs, and degenerated primers of highly conserved APN motifs were used to screen a gut cDNA library. The complete sequence of APN has standard residues involved in zinc co\u2010ordination and catalysis and a glycosyl\u2010phosphatidylinositol anchor, as in APNs from Lepidoptera. APN has a broad specificity towards N\u2010terminal amino acids, but does not hydrolyze acidic aminoacyl\u2010peptides, thus resembling the mammalian enzyme (EC 3.4.11.2). The k (cat)/K (m) ratios for different di\u2010, tri\u2010, tetra\u2010, and penta\u2010peptides suggest a preference for tripeptides, and that subsites S(1), S(2)\u2032 and S(3)\u2032 are pockets able to bind bulky aminoacyl residues. Bestatin and amastatin bound APN in a rapidly reversible mode, with K (i) values of 1.8 \u00B5m and 0.6 \u00B5m, respectively. EDTA inactivates this APN (k (obs) 0.14 m (\u22121)\u00B7s(\u22121), reaction order of 0.44) at a rate that is reduced by competitive inhibitors. In addition to oligopeptide digestion, APN is proposed to be associated with amino\u2010acid\u2010absorption processes which, in contrast with aminopeptidase activity, may be hampered on lectin binding.","publish_time":"2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cristofoletti, Plinio T.; Mendon\u00E7a de Sousa, Flavia A.; Rahb\u00E9, Yvan; Terra, Walter R.","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfbccefd7de204b45de5f73a0999efe39cbe60cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164072.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APN","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amastatin bound APN","complete sequence of APN","internal sequence of APN","conserved APN motifs","subsites S","standard residues","mannose residues","bound aminopeptidase N","APNs","bulky aminoacyl residues","mammalian enzyme","enzyme accounts","\u00B5m","penta\u2010peptides","aminopeptidase activity","acidic aminoacyl","terminal amino acids","gut cDNA library","total gut proteins","degenerated primers","midgut","catalysis","pea aphid","zinc co\u2010ordination","Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris","conservative domain","broad specificity","glycosyl","tripeptides","phosphatidylinositol anchor","absorption processes","entomotoxic lectins","single membrane","contrast","preference","glycoprotein rich","pH optimum","reversible mode","molecular mass","concanavalin family","tetra","addition","oligopeptide digestion","Bestatin","competitive inhibitors","ratios","kDa","reaction order","Lepidoptera","values","detergent","homogeneity","lectin binding","EDTA","obs"],"language":"en"},

However, bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing, parenchymal distortion, dynamic hyperinflation, and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs) affecting transmural pressure. This study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree. Transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction. Briefly, this model incorporates a 12-generation symmetric bronchial tree, and the Anafi and Wilson model for the individual airways of the tree. Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous. Further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winkler, Tilo","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fb2817b7886e0c8d410072556fcb7337a66e029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wilson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Airway transmural pressure","peak transmural pressures","total transmural pressure","Pressure differences","pleural pressure","increased alveolar pressures","increased airway resistance","emergence of VDefs","Bronchoconstriction lead","central airway","integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction","increased regional ventilation","dilated airways","relative increase","highest increase","lowest increase","healthy homogeneous lungs","generation symmetric bronchial tree","dynamic hyperinflation","individual airways","Wilson model","baseline","emergence of ventilation defects","Anafi","contribution","parenchymal distortion","heterogeneity","experimental studies","changes","conclusion","conditions","account","insights","Mechanisms","study"],"language":"en"},

Objective To compare the efficacy of inhaled and intranasal sodium cromoglyeate and matching placebos on the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Methods Adult subjects with symptoms of runny nose, throat pain, or cough for less than 24 h were recruited. They were treated for 7 days using a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, group comparative design. The medication given was: sodium cromoglyeate dry powder 20mg per inhalation in spincaps; sodium cromoglycate aqueous nasal spray delivering 5.2mg per dose; or matching placebo as dry powder and nasal spray. One spincap and one spray per nostril were taken every 2h during waking hours on days 1 and 2 and then four times daily on days 3\u20137. Severity of nine symptoms (general malaise, body aches and pains, chills and shivering, snzeening, nasal running, nasal blocking, sore throat, cough and voice disturbance) was recorded twice daily by subjects on diary cards, using a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Results The sludy was conducted between February and April 1993. One hundred and eighteen patients aged 21\u201363 years (mean 41 years) were included. Symptoms resolved faster (P \u003C 0.001) and the severity in the last three days of treatment was significantly less in patients treated with sodium cromoglycate than with placebo (P \u003C 0.05\u2010day 5; P \u003C 0.01\u2010day 6; P \u003C 0.001\u2010day 7). Side\u2010effects were local and mild and did not differ between the treatment groups. Conclusion Sodium cromoglyeate administered both by inhalation and intranasally is an effective treatment for the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Its combined safety and efficacy would make it an acceptable form of treatment for these conditions.","publish_time":"2006-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C5BERG, N.; \u00C5BERG, B.; ALESTIG, K.","journal":"Clin Exp Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4930321576ed90bada0ad02ba0f448378b3ba2c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days of treatment","sodium cromoglycale","symptomalic treatment","treatment of asthma","effective treatment","treatment groups","intranasal sodium cromoglyeate","Conclusion Sodium cromoglyeate","sodium cromoglyeate dry powder","sodium cromoglycate aqueous nasal spray","symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections","acceptable form of treatment","nasal running","nasal blocking","symptoms of runny nose","inhalation","cough","Severity","patients","years","sore throat","matching placebos","throat pain","efficacy of inhaled","Methods Adult subjects","pains","snzeening","spincaps","body aches","chills","shivering","general malaise","dose","open trials","voice disturbance","established drug","allergy","group comparative design","scale","diary cards","conditions","nostril","waking hours","medication","Side\u2010effects","Background","combined safety","Objective","times","sludy"],"language":"en"},

While the edges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in spreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] may differ in its importance for spreading from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] and from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text]. The key issue is whether node [Formula: see text] , after infected by [Formula: see text] through the edge, would reach out to other nodes that [Formula: see text] itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to invoke two unequal weights [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] characterizing the importance of an edge according to the neighborhoods of nodes [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The total asymmetric directional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure [Formula: see text] , which quantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. An [Formula: see text]-shell decomposition scheme further assigns an [Formula: see text]-shell index or weighted coreness to the nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on [Formula: see text] and the weighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world networks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the nodes\u0027 degree and [Formula: see text]-shell index while maintaining a low computational complexity.

RECENT FINDINGS: SICM is likely underdiagnosed and that has mortality implications. Current evidence supports speckle tracking echocardiography to identify decreased contractility irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction for the diagnosis of SICM. There continues to be a dearth of large clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SICM and current consensus focuses on supportive measures such as vasopressors and inotropes. SUMMARY: Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy has both prognostic and management implications for these patients. Individualized work-up and management of these patients is crucial to improving outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u2019Heureux, Michael; Sternberg, Michael; Brath, Lisa; Turlington, Jeremy; Kashiouris, Markos G.","journal":"Curr Cardiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/432764d8a9792a3c2d1eba6e9a893e7c043281a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222131.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SICM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of SICM","diagnosis of SICM","pathophysiology of SICM","management implications","mortality implications","management strategies","patients","extensive review","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","current consensus","Current evidence","sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy","significant cause of mortality","decreased contractility","left ventricular ejection fraction","speckle tracking echocardiography","supportive measures","data","diagnostic","dearth of large clinical trials","RECENT FINDINGS","vasopressors","inotropes","SUMMARY","epidemiology","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

SP and RVSP were categorized normal, abnormal (flattened/bowed SP or RVSP \u003E 40 mmHg) or missing. RESULTS: Of 1157 infants, 115 infants (10%) died. Abnormal SP or RVSP increased mortality (SP 19% vs. 8% normal/missing, RVSP 20% vs. 9% normal/missing, both p \u003C 0.01) in unadjusted and multivariable models, adjusted for significant covariates (SP OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2\u20133.0; RVSP OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1\u20134.7).

Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.","publish_time":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benavides, Julio A.; Valderrama, William; Streicker, Daniel G.","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d27cf597c7bb3029c304801e4413396e8731d4b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/acf562f91614c114eaeec07bae37b8130968d3df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4920313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vampire"],"organizations":["VBR"],"locations":["Latin America"],"keyphrases":["bat populations","viral expansions","vampire bat-transmitted rabies","bat reservoirs","undermined widespread bat","unvaccinated livestock populations","primary reservoir of rabies","novel strategies","impending viral emergence","recent burden of VBR","important viral zoonoses","natural reservoir populations","high transmission","Vampire bats","pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics","anticipation of outbreaks","Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies","vaccination strategies","novel interventions","enzootic disease","high elevation peaks","cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases","pathogens","uninfected zones","Latin America","invasions form wavefronts","heterogeneous landscapes","Andean valleys","Andes mountains","control","opportunities","viruses","humans","programs","Peru","scarcity of data","years","major obstacle","spatial models","results","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a large outbreak of fatal Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred following a single patient exposure in the emergency department (ED) of the Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary-care hospital in South Korea, which resulted in significant public health and economic burden. After this outbreak, a febrile respiratory infectious disease unit (FRIDU) with a negative pressure ventilation system was constructed outside the emergency department (ED) in 2015, to screen for patients with contagious diseases requiring isolation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who visited the ED with febrile illness between August 2015 and July 2016. Ultimately, 1562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening were analyzed. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 1562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P \u003C 0.001). No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. CONCLUSION: The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.

We investigated the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on mortality through Week 48 post-HCT. METHODS: Adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA at screening who could initiate treatment by Week 4 post-HCT were eligible. Subjects stratified by high or low CMV disease risk were randomized 2:1 to letermovir dosed at 480 mg/d (240 mg/d if on cyclosporine) or placebo PO or IV through Week 14 post-HCT. Time to all-cause mortality and non-relapse mortality (defined as death due to any reason other than the indication for HCT) through Week 48 post-HCT are presented using Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) plots censored at study discontinuation for reasons other than death/non-relapse death or upon study completion. Distribution of time to mortality endpoints was tested by stratified log-rank tests using two-sided P-values. RESULTS: This analysis included all 565 patients randomized and treated with \u22651 dose of study drug. Subjects began study drug a median of 9 days post-HCT; 36.5% started post-engraftment. The observed KM event rate for all-cause mortality was lower in the letermovir group (10.6%) than the placebo group (15.5%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower through Week 48 post-HCT (21.4% vs. 26.2%) (Figure 1). The observed K\u2013M event rate for all-cause mortality in subjects who developed CS-CMVi was also lower in the letermovir group (4.6%) than the placebo group (17.1%) at Week 48 post-HCT. The observed KM event rate for non-relapse mortality was lower in the letermovir group (6.9%) vs. the placebo group (11.2%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower in the letermovir group (13.9%) than the placebo group (17.5%) through Week 48 post-HCT (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: All-cause and non-relapse mortality were reduced in the letermovir group compared with the placebo group through Week 48 post-HCT (relative risk reduction ~18% and ~21%, respectively).

Our objective was to identify health and management factors affecting swine performance. A1998 survey found six leptospirosis serovars and parvovirus and heavy parasites loads, but no brucellosis or pseudorabies. Our 2016 Artificial Insemination Training focused on improving genetics and resulted in 12 sows bred and 103 piglets born. Oour 2017 Swine Farm Evaluation surveyed 26 farms with an average of 9 sows per farm. Serological samples were tested for antibodies against Porcine Circovirus Type 2b (ELISA, 96% positive), Swine Influenza (ELISA, 31%), Senecavirus (IFA, 27%), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (ELISA, 15%), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (IFA, 15%), and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (ELISA, 4%, 1 pig). o evidence was seen of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (ELISA), Transmissable Gastroenteritis (ELISA) or Pseudorabies (SN). Fecal samples contained Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Stephanurus dentatus, and, less commonly, Strongyles nodular worm, Stronglyloides, Brachylaemus suis, Necator species, Trichuris suis, and Fasciolopsis buski. Ear scrapings and scratching behavior indicated the presence of sarcoptic mange (31% of farms). Most farms fed a 14% grain feed (88% of farms) and local feeds (coconut, vegetables, fruits, 69%); only one farm fed an 18% starter and one fed milk to young pigs. One or more thin pigs were seen on 46% of farms. Waste is managed either by wash down (85% of farms) or as dry litter (42%); some farms used both. Wastewater concerns led to water restriction on 12% of farms. In conclusion, parasites and suboptimal feeding are constraints on pig growth and performance. Management recommendations to improve production should address these, in addition to improving health and genetics.","publish_time":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaleski, H; Petznick, T; Hansell, M; Uta, F; Gurr, I","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6285338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["American Samoa","Swine Influenza","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea","Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["farms","ELISA","swine performance","swine production genetics","Swine Farm Evaluation","Swine Influenza","Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus","Porcine Circovirus Type","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea","health","management factors","Management recommendations","IFA","pseudorabies","sows","fed milk","Brachylaemus suis","Trichuris suis","heavy parasites","Respiratory Syndrome","Fecal samples","pig growth","Serological samples","young pigs","Stronglyloides","Oesophagostomum dentatum","Ascaris suum","Necator species","leptospirosis serovars","suboptimal feeding","antibodies","constraints","scratching behavior","Transmissable Gastroenteritis","parvovirus","coconut","Strongyles nodular worm","presence of sarcoptic mange","Stephanurus dentatus","local feeds","vegetables","water restriction","starter","average","Ear scrapings","A1998 survey","Fasciolopsis buski","o evidence","Wastewater concerns","fruits","conclusion","Artificial Insemination Training","brucellosis","Oour","addition","grain feed","American Samoa","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","dry litter","objective","Senecavirus","SN","piglets"],"language":"en"},

They code for an unusually large number of gene products matching that of small DNA viruses (e.g. DNA bacteriophages). The order of appearance and distribution of enzyme genes along various virus families (e.g. helicase and ExoN) may be seen as an evolutionary marker in these large RNA genomes lying at the genome size boundary. A positive correlation exists between (\u002B)RNA virus genome sizes and the presence of the RNA helicase and the ExoN domains. Although the mechanistic basis of the presence of the helicase is still unclear, the role of the ExoN activity has been linked to the existence of an RNA synthesis proofreading system. In large Nidovirales, ExoN is bound to a processive replicative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and corrects mismatched bases during viral RNA synthesis. Over the last decade, a view of the overall process has been refined in Coronaviruses, and in particular in our lab (Ferron et al., PNAS, 2018). We have identified genetic markers of large RNA genomes that we wish to use to data-mine currently existing metagenomic datasets. We have also initiated a collaboration to sequence and explore new viromes that will be searched according to these criteria. Likewise, we have a collection of purified viral RdRps that are currently being used to generate RNA synthesis products that will be compared to existing NGS datasets of cognate viruses. We will be able to have an idea about how much genetic diversity is possibly achievable by viral RdRp (\u2018tunable fidelity\u2019) versus the detectable diversity (i.e. after selection in the infected cell) that is actually produced.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferron, F; Canard, B","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA helicase","viral RNA synthesis","RNA synthesis products","RNA virus genome sizes","processive replicative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","genetic markers of large RNA genomes","current boundary of largest RNA genome sizes","Large-genome Nidoviruses","large Nidovirales","ExoN activity","ExoN domains","genome size boundary","large number of gene products","small DNA viruses","presence","genetic diversity","viral RdRps","existing NGS datasets of cognate viruses","existing metagenomic datasets","DNA bacteriophages","detectable diversity","various virus families","distribution of enzyme genes","mismatched bases","tunable fidelity","selection","role","existence","evolutionary marker","overall process","order of appearance","Ferron","view","Coronaviruses","idea","system","mechanistic basis","collaboration","new viromes","PNAS","infected cell","decade","collection","positive correlation","criteria"],"language":"en"},

In response to the need, we have developed a simulation-based optimization methodology for generating dynamic predictive mitigation strategies for pandemic outbreaks affecting several regions. Our methodology can accommodate varying virus and population dynamics. It progressively allocates a limited budget to procure vaccines and antivirals, capacities for their administration, and resources required to enforce social distancing. The methodology uses measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, which are translated into the costs of lost productivity and medical services. The simulation model was calibrated using historic pandemic data. We illustrate the use of our methodology on a mock outbreak involving over four million people residing in four major population centers in Florida, USA. A sensitivity analysis is presented to estimate the impact of changes in the budget availability and variability of some of the critical parameters of mitigation strategies.

As carbon nanotags accumulate in the test zone due to formation of an antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex, and this allows for the direct visualization of the analytical signal. Under optimal conditions, influenza A virus can be determined in allantoic fluid inoculated with the virus with a limit of detection of 350 TCID(50).mL(\u22121) (i.e., the 50% tissue culture infectious dose). No interference is found for several other tested proteins, and for closely related viruses. Cell lysates containing different seasonal strains of influenza A viruses (including the H1N1 and H3N2 strains) collected from clinical samples were analyzed. It is demonstrated that the method can detect both influenza A viruses without interference by biological matrices. In our perception, this method has a wide potential in that it may be extended to a generally applicable platform for rapid diagnosis influenza A viruses.

We have, therefore, validated a QPCR assay for quantification of a viral aerosol sample using the double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green I, an economical alternative for quantification of target microorganisms. To achieve this objective we used mycobacteriophage D29 as model organism. Phage D29 aerosol was produced in an aerosol cabinet and then collected by use of an AGI liquid sampler. A standard curve was created by use of purified genomic DNA from the phage in liquid culture of known concentration measured by titration. To prevent false-positive results caused by formation of primer\u2013dimers, an additional data-acquisition step was added to the three-step QPCR procedure; the new technique was called four-step QPCR. The standard curve was then used to quantify the total amount of phage D29 in liquid culture and aerosol samples. For liquid culture samples there was no significant difference (P \u003E 0.05) between results from quantification of the virus using double-agar culture and QPCR. For aerosol samples, however, the result determined by the QPCR method was significantly (P \u003C 0.05) higher than that from the double-agar culture method. The four-step SYBR green I QPCR method is a quick quantitative method for mycobacteriophage D29 aerosol. We believe that QPCR using SYBR green I dye will be an economical method for detection of airborne bio-aerosols.","publish_time":"2009-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Zhanbo; Yu, Long; Yang, Wenhui; Wang, Jie; Zhao, Jianjun; Li, Na; Lu, Jianchun; Li, Jinsong","journal":"Aerobiologia (Bologna)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38c37eb79f8cd26e615ecb3d713e66db1eaa9d3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QPCR","AGI","SYBR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aerosol samples","step SYBR green I QPCR method","mycobacteriophage D29 aerosol","liquid culture samples","step QPCR procedure","QPCR assay","double-agar culture method","economical method","aerosol cabinet","liquid culture of known concentration","viral aerosol sample","PCR quantification","quick quantitative method","double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green","use","AGI liquid sampler","quantification of target microorganisms","standard curve","additional data-acquisition step","economical alternative","genomic DNA","detection of airborne bio-aerosols","real-time identification of bio","false-positive results","formation of primer","new technique","dimers","virus","significant difference","promising techniques","model organism","titration","objective"],"language":"en"},

A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3 weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread.

Although diagnostic criteria for SARS have been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), simple adoption of the established criteria may lead to overdiagnosis in patients with cancer or to an increase in the risk of spreading SARS within cancer hospitals. METHODS: The authors report their experience with the exclusion and quarantine of patients with cancer during the peak of the SARS epidemic in Beijing, China. The patients included 4 males and 7 females with a median age of 66 years (range, 39\u201373 years). RESULTS: All 11 patients met the WHO diagnostic criteria for probable SARS. Among those 11 patients with probable SARS, only 1 had confirmed SARS; for the other 10 patients, the possibility of SARS infection was ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Special attention must be paid to patients with cancer who have symptoms similar to those seen in SARS. Although the WHO diagnostic criteria for SARS should be widely accepted, they are not definite or practical in certain populations.

Alongside efficacy testing of novel therapies, effects on pulmonary pathology and disease progression are monitored by using histopathology images from these infected animals. To compare the severity of disease across treatment cohorts, pathologists have historically assigned a semi-quantitative histopathology score that may be subjective in terms of their training, experience, and personal bias. Manual histopathology therefore has limitations regarding reproducibility between studies and pathologists, potentially masking successful treatments. This report describes a pathologist-assistive software tool that reduces these user limitations, while providing a rapid, quantitative scoring system for digital histopathology image analysis. The software, called \u2018Lesion Image Recognition and Analysis\u2019 (LIRA), employs convolutional neural networks to classify seven different pathology features, including three different lesion types from pulmonary tissues of the C3HeB/FeJ tuberculosis mouse model.

METHODS: Chinese (TCMPeriodical Literature Database, Chinese Biological Medicine database, Chinese Medical Current Contents, China Hospital Knowledge Database journal fulltext database, Virtual Machining and Inspection System, and Wanfang) and English (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed and Embase) databases were searched. RESULTS: Three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five articles were initially identified, 606 of which met the inclusion criteria, including 251 in English (83 from the Cochrane Database) and 355 in Chinese. The number of articles published each year increased between 1989 and 2009. Cardiocerebrovascular disease was the most studied target disease. Intervention measures includedTCM preparations (177 articles), acupuncture (133 articles) and combinations of TCM and western medicine (38 articles). Control measures included positive medical (177 articles), basic treatment (100 articles), placebo (219 articles), and blank and mutual (107 articles). All articles included at least one reference; the greatest number was 268. Six of 10 articles with high quality references demonstrated curative effectsagainst target diseasesincludingupper respiratory tract infection, dementia and depression. Interventions that were not recommendedwere tripterygium for rheumatoid arthritis andTCM syndrome differentiation for pediatric nocturia. In 10.4% of the studies, the authors concluded that the intervention had a curative effect. The assessors agreed with the authors\u0027 conclusions in 88.32% of cases, but rejected 8.94% (54 articles). CONCLUSION: 1) Training in systematic review methods, including topic selection, study design, methods and technology, should be improved. 2) Upper respiratory tract infection, dementia and depression may become the predominant diseases treatedby TCM, and the corresponding interventions could be developed into practical applications. 3) Use of non-recommended interventions should be controlled, and there should be more research on side effects.","publish_time":"2013-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Junwen; Cui, Meng; Jiao, Hongguan; Tong, Yuanyuan; Xu, Jun; Zhao, Yingkai; Han, Mei; Liu, Jianping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","TCM","Virtual Machining"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of articles","Chinese Biological Medicine database","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","TCMPeriodical Literature Database","efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine","China Hospital Knowledge Database journal fulltext database","systematic review methods","Chinese Medical Current Contents","western medicine","depression","dementia","combinations of TCM","English","corresponding interventions","recommended interventions","diseasesincludingupper respiratory tract infection","studied target disease","predominant diseases treatedby TCM","curative effect","Intervention measures includedTCM preparations","Control measures","Cardiocerebrovascular disease","greatest number","Virtual Machining","rheumatoid arthritis andTCM syndrome differentiation","topic selection","recommendedwere tripterygium","Inspection System","Wanfang","PubMed","pediatric nocturia","study design","high quality references","evidence","Embase","Training","acupuncture","basic treatment","authors\u0027 conclusions","databases","technology","placebo","practical applications","assessors","cases","inclusion criteria","Use of","year","research","effects","studies","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam. METHODS: The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns. RESULTS: Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yao; Shetty, Amol C.; Lon, Chanthap; Spring, Michele; Saunders, David L.; Fukuda, Mark M.; Hien, Tran Tinh; Pukrittayakamee, Sasithon; Fairhurst, Rick M.; Dondorp, Arjen M.; Plowe, Christopher V.; O\u2019Connor, Timothy D.; Takala-Harrison, Shannon; Stewart, Kathleen","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2db5849f31613681bea16d531009fbe087b8a0c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149848.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEMS"],"locations":["Thailand","Vietnam","Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["EEMS migration maps","optimized workflow","migration estimates","Optimized grids","EEMS grid density","spatial patterns","observed migration patterns","migration of Plasmodium falciparum","resolution of spatial grids","optimization of EEMS grids","malaria parasite migration","genomic data","spatial clustering","EEMS contours","optimal density of EEMS grids","spatial uncertainty","genomic clusters","spatial distance","spatial distribution","new workflow","effective migration surfaces","grid densities","grid resolutions","broad range of EEMS users","estimates of malaria endemicity","geographic properties","density clustering","high model accuracy","Cambodia","geospatial data","geographic areas","study area","study region","bordering regions of Thailand","population structure","genetic structure of natural populations","insight","reduced computing time","validity","variety of fields","demographic","translational applications","means","adaptive processes","approach","visualization","CONCLUSIONS","user-defined parameters","public health","organisms","Vietnam","unguided manner","METHODS","RESULTS","test case","addition","BACKGROUND","Topological skeletons","analyses","information"],"language":"en"},

Despite these advances, significant limitations exist; namely, the inability to eliminate HIV reservoirs, the inability to reverse lymphoid tissues damage, and the lack of an effective vaccine for preventing HIV transmission. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines for eliminating HIV reservoirs and preventing HIV transmission requires robust in vivo models. Since HIV is a human-specific pathogen, that targets hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues, in vivo animal models for HIV-host interactions require incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues. In this review, we will discuss the construction of mouse models with human lymphoid tissues and/or hematopoietic lineage cells, termed, human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice. These HIS-humanized mouse models can support the development of functional human innate and adaptive immune cells, along with primary (thymus) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid tissues. We will discuss applications of HIS-humanized mouse models in evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutics against HIV reservoirs and associated immunopathology, and delineate the human immune response elicited by candidate HIV vaccines. In addition to focusing on how these HIS-humanized mouse models have already furthered our understanding of HIV and contributed to HIV therapeutics development, we discuss how emerging HIS-humanized rat models could address the limitations of HIS-mouse models.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, Yash; Beatty, Cole; Biradar, Shivkumar; Castronova, Isabella; Ho, Sara; Melody, Kevin; Bility, Moses Turkle","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b2c4588c2f596b011b8a6227a92be89014094fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV reservoirs","HIV transmission","understanding of HIV","HIV therapeutics development","humanized mouse models","human lymphoid tissues","candidate HIV vaccines","HIV-host interactions","construction of mouse models","humanized rat models","animal models","reduced HIV-associated morbidity","human immune response","human immune system","lymphoid tissues damage","incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells","human immunodeficiency virus","human-specific pathogen","development of functional human innate","humanized mice","adaptive immune cells","efficacy of therapeutics","effective vaccine","safety","development of safe","inability","effective combination antiretroviral therapies","effective means of protection","associated immunopathology","antiretroviral drugs","significant limitations","infection","decades","lack","past","thymus","mortality","spleen","applications","advances","Evaluation","review","addition"],"language":"en"},

A timely closure of the left-to-right shunt will generally result in the normalization of the pulmonary hemodynamics, but a few patients have severe prognosis in their early childhood. We hypothesized that wide-ranging pathological mechanism in PAH could elucidate the clinical state of severe CHD-PAH. Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed six infants with severe CHD-PAH who had treatment-resistant PH. All patients were born with congenital malformation syndrome. After starting on a pulmonary vasodilator, five of the six patients developed complications including pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and four patients had alveolar hemorrhage. After steroid therapy, the clinical condition improved in four patients, but two patients died. The autopsy findings in one of the deceased patients indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH. Based on the clinical course of these CHD-PAH in patients and the literature, CHD-PAH can occur with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), ILD, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The severity of CHD-PAH may depend on a genetic disorder, respiratory infection, and upper airway stenosis. Additionally, pulmonary vasodilators may be involved in the development of PVOD/PCH and ILD. When patients with CHD-PAH show unexpected deterioration, clinicians should consider complications associated with PVOD/PCH and/or pulmonary disease. In addition, the choice of upfront combination therapy for pediatric patients with CHD-PAH should be selected carefully.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chida-Nagai, Ayako; Sagawa, Koichi; Tsujioka, Takao; Fujimoto, Takanori; Taniguchi, Kota; Sasaki, Osamu; Izumi, Gaku; Yamazawa, Hirokuni; Masaki, Naoki; Manabe, Atsushi; Takeda, Atsuhito","journal":"Heart Vessels","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f838b2aeb6ba6074bd3409d423e0af1b6dea73d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152743/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHD","PVOD/PCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary disease","pediatric patients","deceased patients","clinical state of severe CHD-PAH","pulmonary edema","pulmonary hemodynamics","pulmonary vasodilators","severity of CHD","pulmonary venous hypertension","pulmonary arterial hypertension","pulmonary vascular obstructive disease","pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis","PCH","Congenital heart disease","interstitial lung disease","development of PVOD","presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage","severe prognosis","major complications","clinical condition","clinical course","steroid therapy","congenital malformation syndrome","choice of upfront combination therapy","respiratory infection","unexpected deterioration","clinicians","genetic disorder","upper airway stenosis","infants","treatment-resistant","left-to-right shunt","literature","early childhood","wide-ranging pathological mechanism","timely closure","addition","normalization","autopsy findings","electronic medical records"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore surprising that few investigators have moved beyond the classical methods of antibody production in their search for new reagents. Despite their long-standing efficacy, recombinant antibody generation technologies such as phage display are still largely the tools of biotechnology companies or research groups with a direct interest in protein engineering.

Neonatal mortality continues to remain high with little improvement over the years in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. This region shows the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality and continues to be a significant public health issue. In this study setting, the causes and predictors of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care units are not well documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the causes and predictors of neonatal mortality among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based in prospective follow-up study was conducted among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia from November 1 to December 30, 2018. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and a follow-up checklist. The main outcomes and causes of death were set by pediatricians and medical residents. EpiData 3.1 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of facility-based neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal mortality was 20% (95% CI:16.7\u201323.8%). The causes of death were complications of preterm birth (28.58%), birth asphyxia (22.45%), neonatal infection (18.36%), meconium aspiration syndrome (9.18%), respiratory distress syndrome (7.14%), and congenital malformation (4.08%). Low birth weight, preterm births, length of stay of the neonatal intensive care unit, low 5 min APGAR score, hyperthermia, and initiation of feeding were predictors of neonatal death among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal deaths was unacceptably high. The main causes of death were preventable and treatable. Hence, improving the timing and quality of antenatal care is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and better referral linkage to tertiary health facilities could lead to a reduction in neonatal death in this setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desalew, Assefa; Sintayehu, Yitagesu; Teferi, Nardos; Amare, Firehiwot; Geda, Bifitu; Worku, Teshager; Abera, Kebebush; Asefaw, Abiyot","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88cbf50f4738413bc7aadd62fc0154aa869f8c74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["EpiData"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","Ethiopia","eastern Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["predictors of neonatal death","neonatal deaths","neonatal infection","predictors of neonatal mortality","neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia","main causes of death","predictors of facility","proportion of facility","quality of antenatal care","infants","early initiation of feeding","Low birth weight","complications of preterm birth","prospective follow-up study","birth asphyxia","setting","significant public health issue","early detection","preterm births","follow-up checklist","data entry","main outcomes","tertiary health facilities","meconium aspiration syndrome","respiratory distress syndrome","better referral linkage","neonates","software","years","Social Sciences Version","length","Statistical Package","high-risk newborns","APGAR score","pre-tested structured questionnaire","Sub-Saharan Africa","little improvement","hyperthermia","reduction","crucial period","month","child survival","timely interventions","EpiData","pediatricians","timing","progress","medical residents","Multivariable logistic regression","analysis","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","congenital malformation","BACKGROUND","region","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Suppressed protective immunity was shown in these patients. Although several hypotheses have been formulated, the mechanism of DENV-induced immunosuppression remains unclear. Previously, we found that cross-reactive antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (death receptor 4 [DR4]) were elicited in DHF patients, and that anti-DR4 autoantibody fractions were elicited by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) immunizations in experimental mice. In this study, we found that anti-DR4 antibodies could suppress B lymphocyte function in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the anti-DR4 immunoglobulin (Ig) induced caspase-dependent cell death in immortalized B lymphocyte Raji cells in vitro. Anti-DR4 Igs elicited by NS1 and DR4 immunizations markedly suppressed mouse spleen transitional T2 B (IgM(\u002B)IgD(\u002B)), bone marrow pre-pro-B (B220(\u002B)CD43(\u002B)), pre-B (B220(\u002B)CD43(\u2212)), and mature B cell (B220(\u002B)IgD(\u002B)) subsets in mice. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that the pre-elicitation of anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Ig titers suppressed subsequently neutralizing antibody production by immunization with DENV envelop protein. Our data suggest that the elicitation of anti-DR4 titers through DENV NS1 immunization plays a suppressive role in humoral immunity in mice.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Chung-Lin; Sun, Der-Shan; Su, Mei-Tzu; Lien, Te-Sheng; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Lin, Chun-Yu; Huang, Chung-Hao; King, Chwan-Chuen; Li, Chen-Ru; Chen, Tai-Hung; Chiu, Yu-Hsiang; Lu, Chun-Chi; Chang, Hsin-Hou","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fae230ce5b1886b977830bb4c4d4522bb5e38b30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-DR4 antibodies","anti-DR4 immunoglobulin","Anti-DR4 Igs","DR4 immunizations","anti-DR4 Ig titers","elicitation of anti-DR4 titers","pre-B","anti-DR4 autoantibody fractions","pre-elicitation of anti-NS1","DENV NS1 immunization","B lymphocyte function","mature B cell","B220","mechanism of DENV","bone marrow pre-pro-B","immortalized B lymphocyte Raji cells","suppressed mouse spleen transitional T2 B","death receptor","DHF patients","IgD","experimental mice","CD43","caspase-dependent cell death","cross-reactive antibodies","nonstructural protein","Dengue virus","humoral immunity","protective immunity","induced immunosuppression","life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever","neutralizing antibody production","infections","suppressive role","tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis","TRAIL","IgM","ligand","functional analysis","Treatment","subsets","data","study","hypotheses"],"language":"en"},

It is a fatal disease without early diagnosis and treatment; thus, the availability of affordable diagnostic tools is crucial. However, due to delays caused by import regulations, procurement and late delivery of imported test kits, accessibility remains a problem in the control program. Therefore, we aimed to produce and evaluate the performance of an in-house liquid (AQ) direct agglutination test (DAT) antigen. RESULT: The AQ-DAT was produced at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, using Leishmania donovani strain (MHOM/ET/67/L82). Sera from 272 participants; 110 microscopically confirmed cases of VL, 76 apparently healthy and 86 patients who had infectious disease other than VL were tested with AQ-DAT, and standard kits: Freeze-dried DAT (FD-DAT) and rK39. Taking microscopy as a gold standard; the sensitivity and specificity of the AQ-DAT were 97.3 and 98.8%, respectively. It had high degrees of agreement (k \u003E 0.8), with a significant (P \u003C 0.05) correlation compared to microscopy, FD-DAT, and rK39. CONCLUSION: Although further standardization is required, the in-house AQ-DAT could improve diagnostic accessibility, minimize intermittent stock outs and strengthen the national VL control program.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayelign, Birhanu; Jemal, Mohammedamin; Negash, Markos; Genetu, Meaza; Wondmagegn, Tadelo; Zeleke, Ayalew Jejaw; Worku, Ligabaw; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Shumie, Girma; Behaksra, Sinknesh Wolde; Fenta, Tiruwork; Damte, Demekech; Yeshanew, Arega; Gadisa, Endalamaw","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c36f3eb05842179431901cafe5cb38ad8f410821.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["FD-DAT","in-house AQ-DAT","Freeze-dried DAT","diagnostic accessibility","standard kits","confirmed cases of VL","national VL control program","microscopy","rK39","in-house liquid","gold standard","number of cases","fatal disease","infectious disease","late delivery of imported test kits","direct agglutination test","availability of affordable diagnostic tools","Leishmania donovani strain","procurement","public health","increased geographical distribution","Ethiopia","re-emerging threat","intermittent stock outs","Armauer Hansen Research Institute","MHOM","import regulations","treatment","problem","specificity","Visceral leishmaniasis","early diagnosis","correlation","sensitivity","antigen","BACKGROUND","delays","participants","patients","standardization","performance","high degrees of agreement","L82","RESULT","Sera","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, approved vaccines that prevent ZV infection are not available. To develop an effective vaccine against ZV infection, a lipidated form of ZV envelope protein domain III that possesses an intrinsic adjuvant property was rationally designed. Our goal was to examine the immunogenicity of recombinant lipidated ZV envelope protein domain III (rLZE3) and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate against ZV. METHODS: Recombinant ZV envelope protein domain III (rZE3) and rLZE3 were prepared with an Escherichia coli-based system. Dendritic cell surface marker expression and cytokine production upon stimulation were analyzed to evaluate the function of rLZE3. Neutralizing antibody capacities were evaluated using focus reduction neutralization tests after immunization. To investigate the protective immunity in immunized mice, serum samples collected from immunized mice were adoptively transferred into AG129 mice, and then viremia levels and survival times were examined after ZV challenge. RESULTS: rLZE3 alone but not rZE3 alone efficiently activated dendritic cells in vitro and was taken up by dendritic cells in vivo. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rLZE3 alone (without exogenous adjuvant) could induce ZV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, serum samples obtained from rLZE3-immunized mice provided protection as indicated by a reduction in viremia levels and prolongation of survival times after ZV challenge. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rLZE3 is an excellent vaccine candidate and has great potential that should be evaluated in further preclinical studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Mei-Yu; Chai, Kit Man; Chiang, Chen-Yi; Wu, Chiao-Chieh; Yu, Guann-Yi; Liu, Shih-Jen; Chen, Hsin-Wei","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f0d6c0601ae25bed9ab0680ba5076776f8512c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZV","Recombinant ZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZV infection","ZV challenge","rLZE3-immunized mice","Recombinant ZV envelope protein domain","function of rLZE3","lipidated form of ZV envelope protein domain","immunogenicity of recombinant lipidated ZV envelope protein domain","ZV-specific neutralizing antibody responses","AG129 mice","dendritic cells","viremia levels","serum samples","rZE3","excellent vaccine candidate","effective vaccine","RESULTS","prolongation of survival times","Neutralizing antibody capacities","great potential","exogenous adjuvant","Immunization of C57BL","approved vaccines","Dendritic cell surface marker expression","intrinsic adjuvant property","focus reduction neutralization tests","cytokine production","world","stimulation","METHODS","emergence of Zika virus","protective immunity","subtropical areas","urgent need","protection","Escherichia coli-based system","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","preclinical studies","goal"],"language":"en"},

Clearly, these are extremely ambitious aims, but recent developments in different life science disciplines slowly allow us to set them as realistic, although very distant, goals. Besides classical approaches to obtain high\u2010resolution information of the molecules, particles and machines involved, we require approaches that can monitor collective behaviour of many molecules, particles and machines simultaneously, in order to reveal design principles of the systems as a whole. Here we will discuss approaches that fall in the latter category, namely time\u2010lapse imaging and single\u2010particle tracking (SPT) combined with computational analysis and modelling, and genome\u2010wide RNA interference approaches to reveal the host components required for virus entry.

During the initial stages of neutropenia, most of these infections are bacterial. The spectrum of bacterial infections depends to some extent on whether or not patients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis when neutropenic. Since most transplant recipients do, Gram-positive organisms predominate, due to the fact prophylaxis is directed primarily against Gram-negative organisms. Staphylococcus species (often methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus species (viridans group streptococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci), and Enterococcus species (including vancomycin-resistant strains) are isolated most often. Therefore, potent empiric Gram-positive coverage is recommended by many in this setting. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella species are the most common Gram-negative pathogens isolated. Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter species) are emerging as important pathogens. Many of these organisms acquire multiple mechanisms of resistance that render them multidrug resistant. The administration of prompt, broad-spectrum, empiric, antimicrobial therapy is essential and is generally based on local epidemiology and susceptibility/resistance patterns. Response rate to the initial regimen is generally in the range of 75\u201385%. Fungal infections develop in patients with prolonged neutropenia (greater than 7\u201310 days). Candida species and Aspergillus species are the predominant fungal pathogens, although many other fungi are opportunistic pathogens in this setting. Fungal infections are seldom documented microbiologically or on histopathology, and the administration of empiric antifungal therapy, when such infections are suspected, is the norm. Therapy is often prolonged, and outcomes are still suboptimal. The importance of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship cannot be overemphasized.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nesher, Lior; Rolston, Kenneth V.

Infection of humans with globally circulating human coronaviruses is associated with the common cold. In contrast, transmission of animal coronaviruses to humans can result in severe disease: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are responsible for hundreds of deaths in Asia and the Middle East, respectively, and are both caused by members of the genus Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV that were zoonotically transmitted from an animal host to humans. At present, neither vaccines nor specific treatment is available to combat coronavirus infection in humans, and novel antiviral strategies are urgently sought. The viral spike protein (S) mediates the first essential step in coronavirus infection, viral entry into target cells. For this, the S protein critically depends on priming by host cell proteases, and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. Recent studies revealed that the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L and the serine proteases furin and TMPRSS2 prime the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and provided evidence that successive S protein cleavage at two sites is required for S protein priming. Moreover, mechanisms that control protease choice were unraveled, and insights were obtained into which enzyme promotes viral spread in the host. Here, we will provide basic information on S protein function and proteolytic priming, and we will then discuss recent progress in our understanding of the priming of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dafc91c72b44399ab6256569b6ccc28d6c03bafd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122371.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Asia"],"keyphrases":["S protein priming","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","S proteins of SARS","S protein function","successive S protein cleavage","Infection of humans","viral spike protein","coronavirus infection","proteolytic priming","animal host","Middle East respiratory syndrome","viral entry","host cell proteases","human coronaviruses","viral spread","transmission of animal coronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome","responsible enzymes","severe disease","antiviral intervention","protease choice","Recent studies","recent progress","serine proteases furin","novel antiviral strategies","endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin","sites","TMPRSS2","evidence","specific treatment","essential step","potential targets","Asia","enveloped RNA viruses","hundreds of deaths","target cells","basic information","mammals","vaccines","genus Betacoronavirus","understanding","birds","present","insights","members","contrast","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

However, real-world data tends to be dirty and frequent pattern mining which extracts patterns that are absolutely matched is not enough. An approach, called frequent fault-tolerant pattern (FT-pattern) mining, is more suitable for extracting interesting information from real-world data that may be polluted by noise. Previous research on frequent fault-tolerant pattern mining has been widely studied. However, all of the researches focus on static database. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to analyze the frequent FT-patterns mining in dynamic database. To avoid re-scanning the whole database, beside of keeping the fault-tolerance pattern, we will also keep the potential fault-tolerance pattern that has higher possibility of becoming a fault-tolerance pattern. The experimental results show that by re-using the existing pattern that had been generated, the proposed algorithms are highly efficient in terms of execution time and maximum memory usage for mining fault-tolerance frequent pattern in dynamic database compare to FFM algorithm.","publish_time":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ester, Delvi; lee, Guanling","journal":"New Information and Communication Technologies for Knowledge Management in Organizations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e1e56bd6e52f0156ea47e87debdfc6726f30e5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frequent pattern mining","mining fault-tolerance frequent pattern","frequent fault-tolerant pattern mining","potential fault-tolerance pattern","Mining of frequent patterns","existing pattern","frequent FT-patterns","dynamic database","static database","real-world data","efficient framework","maximum memory usage","terms of execution time","higher possibility","Previous research","interesting information","FFM algorithm","proposed algorithms","approach","experimental results","paper","researches","noise","years"],"language":"en"},

Autophagy (macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy) is a self-digestive process in response to environmental stress to eukaryotic cells, by which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the lysosome for recycling and degradation. The oxidative stress response is directed against any oxidative stress and is mediated by antioxidative defense systems including antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, and energy-dependent efflux pumps. The heat shock response is induced upon exposure of cells to any stress condition and characterized by emission of heat shock proteins which operate as DAMPs to maintain and restore homeostasis. The unfolded protein response is induced by any stress of the endoplasmic reticulum that is perceived by three sensor molecules. Under remediable endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, the sensors trigger signalling pathways to resolve this stress. However, in severe irremediable endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response may lead to pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses resulting in regulated cell death. Finally, the DNA damage response is induced by any DNA damage that occurs in a variety of exogenous and endogenous conditions. When successful, this stress response leads to DNA repair and is associated with the emission of various DAMPs which contribute to restoration of homeostasis. When unsuccessful, the DNA damage response, like the unsuccessful unfolded protein response, can result in regulated cell death, either in form of apoptosis or necrosis. Together, the ultimate goal of all the stress responses is to maintain cellular homeostasis and ensure cell integrity. When they fail, the incidence of regulated cell death is frequently observed.","publish_time":"2018-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Land, Walter Gottlieb","journal":"Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9511bf155b91f51b7c1e705366fdf3ac58ef49d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122488.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oxidative stress response","DNA damage response","environmental stress","unfolded proteins response","heat shock response","unsuccessful unfolded protein response","intrinsic stress responses","remediable endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions","severe irremediable endoplasmic reticulum stress","role of cell","incidence of regulated cell death","cell integrity","DNA repair","emission of heat shock proteins","pro-apoptotic responses","cellular homeostasis","restoration of homeostasis","emission of various DAMPs","chaperone-mediated autophagy","antioxidant enzymes","detoxifying enzymes","eukaryotic cells","exposure of cells","endogenous conditions","self-digestive process","glutathione peroxidase","superoxide dismutase","sensors","antioxidative defense systems","autophagic processes","microautophagy","signalling pathways","energy-dependent efflux pumps","lysosome","cytoplasmic components","variety of exogenous","form of apoptosis","macroautophagy","ultimate goal","recycling","degradation","necrosis","chapter","sensor molecules"],"language":"en"},

Initially discovered with features of rubor, tumor, calor, and dolor, scientific investigations have revealed chemical components, cells, and pathways involved in the process of inflammation. The body\u2019s initial defense in response to infection, trauma, or inflammation is through the acute-phase response (APR). APR is a multifaceted set of systemic reactions seen shortly after the experience of a triggering event. One of the many aspects of an APR is the increased hepatic synthesis of positive acute-phase proteins (APPs) leading to increased serum concentration of these proteins. The serum level of these APPs returns to base concentration when the stimulating factor is not anymore present. Today a plethora of inflammatory diseases are causing concern to global health. All the key players and mediators of inflammation change its role with the change in setup of disease and patients. The biomarkers of inflammation and inflammatory mediators are also used as therapeutic targets in under-trial animal models. Even in clinical diagnosis of an inflammatory patient, some broad-spectrum markers were analyzed without individual dissection of each mediator or biomarker. This chapter also provides a review of the acute-phase protein C-reactive protein and its possible use as inflammatory biomarker in diseases. We have highlighted case studies of some patients from Kolkata, India, revealing inflammation from disease together with their clinical history. The question which we probe in here is that whether there is a correlation with the clinical history, C-reactive protein, and inflammation and whether CRP can act as a unique diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in some diseases. The future course of this chapter lies in identifying clinical markers for inflammation, the sequential flow of inflammatory responses for a wide spectrum of diseases and its diagnostic, and therapeutic application to screen out pro-inflammatory diseases vs. anti-inflammatory conditions.","publish_time":"2016-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansar, Waliza; Ghosh, Shyamasree","journal":"Biology of C Reactive Protein in Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122703.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["mediators of inflammation","inflammatory biomarker","biomarkers of inflammation","process of inflammation","inflammatory mediators","pro-inflammatory diseases","plethora of inflammatory diseases","inflammatory patient","clinical markers","clinical history","knowledge of inflammation records dates","acute-phase protein C-reactive protein","acute-phase response","clinical diagnosis","wide spectrum of diseases","sequential flow of inflammatory responses","APPs","increased serum concentration","prognostic biomarker","patients","chapter","change","increased hepatic synthesis of positive acute-phase proteins","therapeutic targets","therapeutic application","broad-spectrum markers","unique diagnostic","base concentration","setup of disease","serum level","possible use","calor","infection","chemical components","scientific investigations","dolor","under-trial animal models","pathways","individual dissection","Kolkata","concern","body\u2019s initial defense","experience","tumor","cells","stimulating factor","century","trauma","anti-inflammatory conditions","role","India","CRP","review","multifaceted set of systemic reactions","features of rubor","global health","case studies","key players","correlation","triggering event","future course","aspects","question"],"language":"en"},

Only animal experiments performed by Louis Pasteur at the end of the nineteenth century, in which no dilution of the poisonous properties was achieved even after several passages, suggested that the disease-causing agent was able to multiply in the organism. Therefore, there was talk of a reproducible \u201Cvirus\u201D (Latin for \u201Cpoison\u201D or \u201Cslime\u201D) in living organisms, and later also in cells. In St. Petersburg in 1892, Dimitri I. Ivanovski demonstrated that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an \u201Cultrafilterable\u201D agent, whose size is significantly smaller than that of bacteria: tobacco mosaic virus (bacteria filters have a pore size of approximately 0.2 \u03BCm, however, most viruses are smaller than 0.1 \u03BCm). Soon afterwards, Martinus Willem Beijerinck came to the same conclusion: he developed, for the first time, the notion of a self-replicating, \u201Cliquid\u201D agent (contagium vivum fluidum). The discovery of foot-and-mouth disease virus by Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch in Greifswald in 1898 was the first evidence of an animal pathogenic virus.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfff8472c0711b0e41d5f509eeb39715097a94d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dimitri I.

In the meantime, protein deubiquitination by various deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulates protein stability within cells, and it can counterbalance intracellular homeostasis mediated by ubiquitination. Numerous reports have demonstrated that an aberrant process of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) regulated by the ubiquitination and deubiquitination systems results in failure of balancing between protein stability and degradation, and this failure can lead to tumorigenesis in various organs and tissues of mammals. The identification of molecular properties for various DUBs is very critical to understand cancer development and tumorigenesis. Therefore, knowledge of DUBs and their association with cancer and diseases is indispensible for developing effective inhibitors for DUBs. This chapter describes various features and functions of cancer-related DUBs. In addition, we summarize several inhibitors that specifically target certain DUBs in cancer and suggest that DUBs may be one of the most ideal and attractive therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2014-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baek, Kwang-Hyun; Lim, Key-Hwan; Park, Jang-Joon","journal":"Resistance to Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d50fed9fb9caf27545b4655b507925a9831cab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123001.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various DUBs","related DUBs","certain DUBs","knowledge of DUBs","various features","various organs","protein deubiquitination","protein stability","functions of cancer","cancer development","various deubiquitinating enzymes","tumorigenesis","failure of balancing","deubiquitination systems","effective inhibitors","S proteasome","ubiquitin-proteasome pathway","aberrant process","diseases","association","identification of molecular properties","UPP","degradation","meantime","cells","tissues of mammals","attractive therapeutic targets","chapter","Numerous reports","intracellular homeostasis","ubiquitinated proteins","addition"],"language":"en"},

Increasing evidence also suggests that cancer-causing pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and human papilloma virus (HPV) may induce oncogenesis by disrupting cell polarity. This is mainly achieved through their ability to deregulate the function of cell polarity components and/or regulators. Hence cell polarity represents the first line of defence against infection. Interestingly, EGFR/RAS oncogenic signals also induce cancer cell invasion by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Since the loss of cell polarity is a prerequisition of EMT, cell polarity also represents the last line of defence against cancer cell invasion. As such we argue that cell polarity may be a key defence mechanism against infection and cancer cell invasion. The potential role of cell polarity as a gatekeeper against cancer through its ability to regulate asymmetric cell division and tumour suppression has been discussed in a number of recent reviews. In this review we will focus on the role of cell polarity as a potential target of infection and cancer cell invasion.","publish_time":"2014-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yihua; Lu, Xin","journal":"Cell Polarity 2","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b19fd828b7cac5737620070ca84b9e8034004806.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123024.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR/RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loss of cell polarity","cancer cell invasion","potential role of cell polarity","maintenance of epithelial cell polarity","function of cell polarity components","asymmetric cell division","line of defence","potential target of infection","ability","key defence mechanism","Helicobacter pylori","prerequisition of EMT","cancer-causing pathogens","number of cellular targets of pathogens","number of recent reviews","RAS oncogenic signals","human papilloma virus","gatekeeper","tumour suppression","mesenchymal transition","HPV","oncogenesis","EGFR","establishment","regulators","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Researchers have discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the epidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous cases. In this paper, we explore if and under what conditions the mean-field approach could perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular, we employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state, where the fraction of infected nodes remains stable for a long time, obtained by the continuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on an individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the underlying network topology. Moreover, for the heterogeneity of the infection rates, we consider not only the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate correlated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is generally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given the same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual prevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive. Our work suggests the conditions when the mean-field approach, in particular NIMFA, is more accurate in the approximation of the SIS epidemic with heterogeneous infection rates.","publish_time":"2016-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qu, Bo; Wang, Huijuan","journal":"Complex Networks \u0026 Their Applications V","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56b88702d63277beff4ebef2c1bd01b6a50b017c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS","NIMFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heterogeneous infection rates","effective infection rate","Mean Field Approximation","mean-field approaches","individual-based mean-field approximation","Susceptible-Infected","particular NIMFA","heterogeneous cases","average fraction of infected nodes","infected neighbor","SIS epidemic","advanced approach","nodal degree","end nodes","homogeneous cases","different pairs of nodes","conditions","variance","lower prevalence","correlation","actual prevalence","long time","continuous-time simulation","underlying network topology","model","metastable state","years","heterogeneity","Researchers","paper"],"language":"en"},

The immunocompromised state of many cancer patients constitutes the basis for the frequent failure of the host to promote a normal and rapid recovery from an acute respiratory viral infection and results in a more severe and prolonged infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Those respiratory viruses that are most prevalent and most prone to produce lower respiratory illnesses and pneumonia in healthy hosts, RSV, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses, are those most likely to cause severe illness and pneumonia leading to hospitalization in immunocompromised persons. However, viruses less prone to produce a lower respiratory illness but that are highly prevalent, such as rhinoviruses, may frequently be associated with severe illness. The limited availability of antivirals and vaccines for the acute respiratory viruses means that these infections will continue to be important for many years and dictate a need for utilizing infection control procedures as much as possible, particularly in hospitals and institutions, so as to minimize spread. Efforts to develop specific vaccines are important as their use could prevent as well as reduce exposure of cancer patients to these viruses. Development of specific antivirals is important for use in immunocompromised patients as normal recovery mechanisms may be seriously impaired.","publish_time":"2011-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chemaly, Roy F.; Rathod, Dhanesh B.; Couch, Robert","journal":"Principles and Practice of Cancer Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e85748fe82e154ef6556bb51c79137ea16ac546e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory viruses","parainfluenza viruses","immunocompromised patients","severe illness","acute respiratory viral infection","lower respiratory illnesses","acute infectious illness","exposure of cancer patients","pneumonia","prolonged infection","specific vaccines","immunocompromised persons","immunocompromised state","normal recovery mechanisms","infection control procedures","Development of specific antivirals","rapid recovery","common cause","limited availability of antivirals","healthy hosts","RSV","results","significant morbidity","hospitalization","need","basis","mortality","developed societies","group","infections","frequent failure","institutions","Efforts","hospitals","years","spread","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

The relationship can occur in both directions, with nasal allergen challenge leading to inflammatory changes in the lower airway and bronchoprovocation studies of the lower airway leading to inflammatory changes in the upper airway. In addition, both similarities and differences exist in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and asthma. The mechanism for the connection between the upper and lower airways is a matter of great debate. It has been proposed that inflammatory changes in the lower airway may lead to systemic inflammatory effects that play a role in increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Similarly, lower airway inflammatory changes may affect nasal airway patency via systemic effects. Moreover, nasopharyngeal-bronchial reflexes may play a non-immunologic role in the interaction between the lower and upper airways. An example of the connection between the upper and lower airways is found in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease whereby leukotrienes play a role in the pathology of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and asthma.

Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM.

Thus, repeated anthropometric and laboratory markers must be jointly analyzed but individually interpreted according to disease and metabolic changes, in order to modify and monitor the nutritional treatment. In addition, isotope techniques are neither clinically feasible nor compatible with the multiple measurements needed to follow progression. On the other hand, indirect alternatives exist but may have pitfalls, of which the clinician must be aware. Risks exist for both overfeeding and underfeeding of PICU patients so that an accurate monitoring of energy expenditure, using targeted indirect calorimetry, is necessary to avoid either extreme.

However, the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely understood. Advancement in our comprehension of mechanisms of immune senescence and development of interventions to improve health span requires animal models that closely recapitulate the physiological changes that occur with aging in humans. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are invaluable preclinical models to study the underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis due to their outbred nature, high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, and their susceptibility to human pathogens. In this chapter, we review NHP models available for biogerontology research, advantages and challenges they present, and advances they facilitated. Furthermore, we emphasize the utility of NHPs in characterizing immune senescence, evaluating interventions to reverse aging of the immune system, and development of vaccine strategies that are better suited for this vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivera, Andrea; Rais, Maham; Barr, Tasha; Arnold, Nicole; Sureshchandra, Suhas; Messaoudi, Ilhem","journal":"Handbook of Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b808c0b8ad1976fc795a1c13d427d20cbd515443.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune senescence","immune system","animal models","development of interventions","humans","aging","invaluable preclinical models","NHP models available","health care system","health span","physiological similarity","higher susceptibility","advanced age","physiological changes","comprehension of mechanisms","considerable challenges","utility of NHPs","development of vaccine strategies","underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis","high degree of genetic","biogerontology research","outbred nature","life expectancy","advantages","infectious diseases","number of individuals","dramatic increase","Nonhuman primates","chapter","dysregulated immunity","human pathogens","Advancement","vulnerable population"],"language":"en"},

Throughout the middle ages, several descriptions of dermatophytosis were produced where it is described as \u2018tinea\u2019. The keratin-destroying moths which made circular holes in the woollen garments are known as Tinea. Due to similarity in the structure of circular lesion of dermatophytosis on the smooth skin with the circular hole made by moth, Cassius Felix introduced the term \u2018tinea\u2019 to describe the lesions. In 1806, Alibert used the term \u2018favus\u2019 to describe the honey-like exudate in some scalp infections. However, the fungal aetiology of tinea was first detected by Robert Remak, a Polish physician who first observed the presence of hyphae in the crusts of favus. This detection is also a landmark in medical history because this is the first description of a microbe causing a human disease. He himself did not publish his work, but he permitted the reference of his observations in a dissertation by Xavier Hube in 1837. Remak gave all the credits of his discovery to his mentor Schoenlein who first published the fungal etiological report of favus in 1839. He observed the infectious nature of the favus by autoinoculation into his own hands and also successfully isolated the fungus later (1945) and named Achorion schoenleinii (Trichophyton schoenleinii) in honour of his mentor. In 1844, Gruby described the etiologic agent of tinea endothrix, later became known as Trichophyton tonsurans. The genus Trichophyton was created and described by Malmsten (1845) with its representative species T. tonsurans. Charles Robin identified T. mentagrophytes in 1847 and T. equinum was identified by Matruchot and Dassonville in 1898. Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud (France) first compiled the description of Trichophyton in his book (Les Teignes) in 1910 which was based on his observation in artificial culture. The sexual state of dermatophyte was described by Nannizzi (1927). Emmons (1934) first reported the classification of dermatophytes based on vegetative structures and conidia. Gentles (1958) established the successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samanta, Indranil","journal":"Veterinary Mycology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07677443a0fac819b6b9cf88ced0cf5703728848.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cassius Felix","Robert Remak","Remak","Xavier Hube","Schoenlein","Charles Robin","Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud","Les Teignes","Emmons"],"organizations":["De Re Medicina","Tinea","Matruchot"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["description of Trichophyton","Trichophyton schoenleinii","fungal aetiology of tinea","description of dermatophytosis","Trichophyton tonsurans","crusts of favus","genus Trichophyton","successful treatment of tinea capitis","etiologic agent of tinea endothrix","circular holes","structure of circular lesion of dermatophytosis","descriptions of dermatophytosis","fungal etiological report of favus","term","Achorion schoenleinii","mentor Schoenlein","kerion of Celsus","Robert Remak","scalp infections","suppurative infection of scalp","smooth skin","Cassius Felix","France","porrigo","observations","dissertation","vegetative structures","Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud","Polish physician","Roman encyclopaedist","autoinoculation","griseofulvin","woollen garments","honour","classification of dermatophytes","presence of hyphae","mentagrophytes","equinum","landmark","reference","Xavier Hube","conidia","medical history","exudate","discovery","microbe","middle ages","moths","similarity","hands","infectious nature","credits","Gruby","honey","book","sexual state of dermatophyte","human disease","representative species","artificial culture","Charles Robin","Matruchot","Dassonville","Nannizzi","detection","keratin","Malmsten","Teignes","Alibert","work","fungus","Gentles","Medicina","lesions","Emmons"],"language":"en"},

Two young men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which was inexplicable at that time, as these health outcomes were rare among their age, race/ethnicity, and individuals not living in nursing homes. Subsequently, it was found that after infection with HIV, individuals were asymptomatic up to 4 weeks and if symptoms developed, they appeared as a simple type of flu. The progression and global proliferation of the HIV pandemic is mirrored by the spread of Zika virus (ZikaV). Humans were probably first infected with HIV in the Kinshasa region in the 1940s and ZikaV was first detected in humans in the Zika forest in the 1950s. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes transmit ZikaV, an arbovirus, as well as other related arboviruses. In addition to mosquito transmission, ZikaV transmission occurs through sexual risk and blood transfusions. The latter two risk factors were prominent modes of transmission during the early stages of HIV/AIDS epidemic and sexual transmission risk remains prominent. In addition, injection drug use is a risk factor to become HIV infected. For HIV, blood transfusion risk was reduced after appropriate testing of blood supplies. Unlike HIV, ZikaV does not produce significant symptoms that require medical attention among four-fifths of infected individuals. Indeed, initially considered a relatively benign virus, the unexpected emergence of ZikaV in the Americas since 2015, and continuing as a virulent and pathological virus for children and adults, created a sense of fear and distress. These emotional responses parallel the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Clinicians, epidemiologists, and other scientists are currently increasingly laboring to discern the full spectrum of risk, relative to vector and population behaviors, and as with HIV, to develop vaccines and chemotherapy against ZikaV. NIH and Walter Reed ZikaV vaccines are on the way.","publish_time":"2017-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeanene Bengoa, A.; McCoy, Clyde B.; Foley, Brian T.; Puri, Shikha; Mendez, Alejandro J.; Shapshak, Paul","journal":"Global Virology II - HIV and NeuroAIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2b8275bc20b01a8e09ed20d34946314a2f63e7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumocystis","Walter Reed"],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","HIV","NIH"],"locations":["United States","Kaposi","Kinshasa"],"keyphrases":["ZikaV transmission","HIV pandemic","sexual transmission risk","sexual risk","early stages of HIV","spectrum of risk","documented cases of HIV","risk factors","blood transfusion risk","unexpected emergence of ZikaV","Walter Reed ZikaV vaccines","mosquito transmission","AIDS epidemic","prominent modes of transmission","fifths of infected individuals","pathological virus","benign virus","spread of Zika virus","addition","blood transfusions","Humans","Aedes aegypti","appropriate testing of blood supplies","significant symptoms","Zika forest","Aedes albopictus mosquitoes","unusual disease spectrum","Kaposi sarcoma","Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia","adults","children","physicians","vector","injection drug use","medical attention","population behaviors","Kinshasa region","health outcomes","race","global proliferation","NIH","United States","sense of fear","emotional responses","time","young men","ethnicity","weeks","Americas","progression","way","infection","chemotherapy","simple type of flu","Clinicians","epidemiologists","scientists","distress","nursing homes","related arboviruses"],"language":"en"},

These crises and the resulting displacement differ by their causes, intensity, geography, phases and affected populations. The chapter examines movements stemming directly and indirectly from: persecution, armed conflict, extreme natural hazards that cause extensive destruction of lives and infrastructure; slower onset environmental degradation, such as drought and desertification, which undermine livelihoods; manmade environmental disasters, such as nuclear accidents, which destroy habitat and livelihoods; communal violence, civil strife and political instability; and global pandemics that cause high levels of mortality and morbidity. Demographic trends are themselves drivers of displacement in conjunction with other factors. This can play out in two ways\u2014demography as a macro-level factor and demographic composition as a micro-level driver of movement. The chapter compares the paucity of legal, policy and institutional frameworks for addressing crisis-related movements with the more abundant frameworks for addressing the consequences of refugee movements. The chapter discusses the policy implications of the findings, positing that State-led initiatives such as the Nansen and Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiatives are useful mechanisms to fill protection gaps in the absence of political will to adopt and implement more binding legal frameworks. It also argues that, in the context of slow onset climate change, in particular, there is a need for better understanding of how population density, distribution and growth as well as household composition affect vulnerability and resilience to the drivers of displacement.","publish_time":"2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Susan F.","journal":"Demography of Refugee and Forced Migration","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dcdb441fadf195dbfe3fbca266688f6a4d923e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122144.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","drivers of displacement","binding legal frameworks","livelihoods","demographic composition","Crisis initiatives","institutional frameworks","paucity of legal","abundant frameworks","crisis-related movements","resulting displacement","consequences of refugee movements","national legal norms","slower onset environmental degradation","political instability","household composition","absence of political","Demographic trends","migration consequences","policy implications","macro-level factor","manmade environmental disasters","micro-level driver of movement","broad range of humanitarian crises","context of slow onset climate change","organizational roles","extreme natural hazards","policies","infrastructure","extensive destruction of lives","communal violence","civil strife","relations","global pandemics","Countries","useful mechanisms","population density","good practices","protection gaps","geography","phases","distribution","armed conflict","growth","habitat","causes","intensity","nuclear accidents","Migrants","drought","resilience","high levels of mortality","better understanding","need","persecution","demography","desertification","vulnerability","Nansen","affected populations"],"language":"en"},

Her documentary Under the Dome further shows how the internet has transformed the ecology of media and provided innovative platforms for social engagement. Chai\u2019s embracing her own feelings of vulnerability, which dominated the beginning of her career, and using it to channel public feelings and drive news reporting has made her a distinctively controversial media personality.

The discovery of human-specific changes in sialic acid biology is one step toward explaining the genetic basis of human uniqueness, one of the major activities in primatology, contributing to answering a transdisciplinary question: What makes us human?","publish_time":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayakawa, Toshiyuki; Varki, Ajit","journal":"Post-Genome Biology of Primates","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c26aeaf55da513d9f9a323754ed2aea93fd57c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human-specific changes","human evolution","discovery of human","evolution of sialic acid biology","Sialic acids","genetic basis of human uniqueness","cell communication","components of cell","genes","important roles","surface glycans","genome structure","possible impact","host","expression","step","pathogen interaction","primates","major activities","primatology","function","receptors","enzymes","overview","transdisciplinary question","transporters","years of research","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of plant-specific steroid hormones, control many of the developmental and physiological processes like their animal counterparts, including regulation of gene expression, cell division and expansion, differentiation, programmed cell death, and homeostasis. Recent studies have indicated that these hormones have antiviral, antifungal, antiproliferative, antibacterial, neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties in animal system. BRs analogues have been reported to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), arenaviruses as well as against replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Vero cells. Also, antiherpetic activities both in a human conjunctive cell line (IOBA-NHC) and murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental models have been reported. In human cells, anticancer structure-activity relationship of natural BRs revealed their high cytotoxic activity. Since, BRs and their analogues are reported to inhibit cell growth in cancer cell lines, they may be considered as promising phytohormones for potential anticancer drugs. The use of pollens in folk medicine also indicates scope of steroids of plant pollens in medicines.

Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005). The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009). Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals. Finally, infectious livestock diseases are a threat for public health: about 75% of human infectious agents that emerged in the last 25 years had an animal origin (King et al. 2006).","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fourni\u00E9, Guillaume; Walker, Patrick; Porphyre, Thibaud; M\u00E9tras, Rapha\u00EBlle; Pfeiffer, Dirk","journal":"Health and Animal Agriculture in Developing Countries","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7467147b5d2e3a436ec805b351b2b36f2593aeda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shirley","McMichael","Randolph","Rogers","Brown"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["livestock products","trade of livestock","ecology of infectious livestock diseases","intensification of livestock production","livestock-derived products","Numerous infectious diseases","human infectious agents","re-emergence of infectious agents","Animal health governance","Holland","outbreaks of FMD","public health","animal origin","years","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","pathogenic avian influenza H7N7","ability of affected countries","new challenges","economic impact of associated outbreaks","high impact","Production systems","frequency of emergence","developed countries","exposed animals","globalization of human travel","Treatment-resistant strains","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","United Kingdom","agricultural practices","Alexander","HPAIV","climate changes","modification","foot","development","conditions","threat","classical swine fever","farmer livelihood","spatial distribution","Randolph","McMichael","Weiss","MRSA","mouth disease","increase","decades","Tomley","Jones","Bluetongue virus serotypes","Rogers","world","result of culling","parts","Brown","example","northern direction","loss of millions","Shirley","Gibbs"],"language":"en"},

Citizens can play a major role in shaping vital urban spaces and forging bonds out of degraded spaces and estranged relationships. Distressed urban areas, the backstage of urban dramas where underprivileged and excluded citizens come together, can be transformed into innovative neighborhoods and vibrant inclusive communities acting as extended families for the disadvantaged.

This chapter focused on developing a base of evidence suggesting that NAC administration improves disease by increasing cysteine and/or GSH in a variety of diseases, thereby implying a significant role for GSH deficiency in the clinical basis of many diseases.

Human sewage contains enteric bacteria as normal flora, and has the potential to contain parasites, bacteria and viruses which may prove pathogenic to Antarctic wildlife. Treatment can reduce levels of micro-organisms in sewage effluent, but is not a requirement of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol). In contrast, the deliberate release of non-native organisms for any other reason is prohibited. Hence, disposal of sewage effluent to the marine environment is the only activity routinely undertaken in Antarctica knowing that it will likely result in the release of large numbers of potentially non-native species. When the Madrid Protocol was negotiated, the decision to allow release of untreated sewage effluent was considered the only pragmatic option, as a prohibition would have been costly, and may not have been achievable by many Antarctic operators. In addition, at that time the potential for transmission of pathogens to wildlife from sewage was not emphasised as a significant potential risk. Since then, the transmission of disease-causing agents between species is more widely recognised and it is now timely to consider the risks of continued discharge of sewage effluent in Antarctica and whether there are practical alternatives.","publish_time":"2008-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, J.

With the advent of r-DNA technology, it is possible to construct vector with immunologically active genes against specific pathogens. Nevertheless, site-specific delivery of constructed genetic material is an important contributory factor for eliciting specific cellular and humoral immune response. Nanotechnology has demonstrated immense potential for the site-specific delivery of biomolecules. Several polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers have been utilized for the delivery of genetic materials. These systems seem to have better compatibility, low toxicity, economical and capable to delivering biomolecules to intracellular site for the better expression of desired antigens. Further, surface engineering of nanocarriers and targeting approaches have an ability to offer better presentation of antigenic material to immunological cells. This chapter gives an overview of existing and emerging nanotechnological approaches for the delivery of genetic materials.","publish_time":"2013-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goyal, Amit K.; Rath, Goutam; Garg, Tarun","journal":"DNA and RNA Nanobiotechnologies in Medicine: Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2264ce10f3744d6637f5ab72042e23806afe2512.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delivery of genetic materials","site-specific delivery of biomolecules","site-specific delivery of constructed genetic material","Genetic immunization","better compatibility","better presentation of antigenic material","multifaceted immunological response","important findings","immunological cells","better expression of desired antigens","specific pathogens","lipidic nanocarriers","important contributory factor","emerging nanotechnological approaches","humoral immune response","surface engineering of nanocarriers","intracellular site","overview of existing","low toxicity","ability","active genes","immense potential","DNA technology","vector","infectious diseases","advent of r","chapter","Nanotechnology","systems"],"language":"en"},

Although the primary function of ubiquitin was initially associated with proteolysis, it is now considered as a key regulator of protein function controlling, among other functions, signalling cascades, transcription, apoptosis or oncogenesis. Failure at any level of the UPS is associated with the development of multiple pathologies including metabolic problems, immune diseases, inflammation and cancer. The successful use of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade) in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) revealed the potential of the UPS as pharmacological target. Ten years later, new inhibitors tackling not only the proteasome but also different subsets of enzymes which conjugate or de-conjugate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules, have been developed. Most of them are excellent tools to characterize better the emerging molecular mechanisms regulating distinct critical cellular processes. Some of them have been launched already while many others are still in pre-clinical development. This chapter updates some of the most successful efforts to develop and characterize inhibitors of the UPS which tackle mechanisms involved in cancer. Particular attention has been dedicated to updating the status of the clinical trials of these inhibitors.","publish_time":"2014-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mata-Cantero, Lydia; Lobato-Gil, Sof\u00EDa; Aillet, Fabienne; Lang, Val\u00E9rie; Rodriguez, Manuel S.","journal":"Stress Response Pathways in Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fde4d185b30f2a5897ffe022878a28ba82cdd51a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UPS","Ubiquitin-Proteasome System","de-conjugate ubiquitin","primary function of ubiquitin","development of multiple pathologies","new inhibitors","cancer","proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib","treatment of multiple myeloma","multiple stress signals","pre-clinical development","cellular response","successful use","successful efforts","clinical trials","emerging molecular mechanisms","distinct critical cellular processes","key regulator of protein function controlling","metabolic problems","immune diseases","functions","inflammation","potential","setting","Velcade","mantle cell lymphoma","different subsets of enzymes","cascades","transcription","MCL","important role","apoptosis","oncogenesis","pharmacological target","molecules","excellent tools","chapter updates","status","years","Failure","level","Particular attention","proteolysis"],"language":"en"},

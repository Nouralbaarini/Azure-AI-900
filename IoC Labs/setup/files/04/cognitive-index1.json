The eddy covariance method and isotope signals of rain, plant, soil, and stream waters were used to determine forest water sources under different moisture conditions. Four sampling events were conducted to collect soil and plant twig samples in wet, moderate, dry, and very dry conditions for the identification of isotopic signals. Annual ET from 2012 to 2015 was quite stable with an average of 1,182 \u00B1 26 mm, and a substantial daily ET was observed even during drought periods, although some decline was observed, corresponding with volumetric soil water content. During the wet period, water for ET was supplied from the surface soil layer between 0 and 0.5 m, whereas in the dry period, approximately 50% to 90% was supplied from the deeper soil layer below 0.5\u2010m depth, originating from water precipitated several months previously at this forest. Isotope signatures demonstrated that the water sources of the plants, soil, and stream were all different. Water in plants was often different from soil water, probably because plant water came from a different source than water that was strongly bound to the soil particles. Plants showed no preference for soil depth with their size, whereas the existence of storage water in the xylem was suggested. The evapotranspiration at this forest is balanced and maintained using most of the available water sources except for a proportion of rapid response run\u2010off.","publish_time":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lion, Marryanna; Kosugi, Yoshiko; Takanashi, Satoru; Noguchi, Shoji; Itoh, Masayuki; Katsuyama, Masanori; Matsuo, Naoko; Shamsuddin, Siti\u2010Aisah","journal":"Hydrol Process","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dad0e3c7ba251a683c549e3c2f4f95f4b45e0db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ET"],"locations":["Pasoh Forest Reserve","Peninsular Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["plant water","forest water sources","water use","volumetric soil water content","available water sources","soil depth","supporting water source","existence of storage water","soil particles","surface soil layer","deeper soil layer","different source","plants","dry conditions","Annual ET","dry period","lowland dipterocarp forest","Pasoh Forest Reserve","different moisture conditions","substantial daily ET","wet period","plant twig samples","isotope signals of rain","Isotope signatures","stream waters","identification of isotopic signals","year assessment of evapotranspiration","tropical rainforest","size","eddy covariance method","proportion of rapid response run\u2010off","Peninsular Malaysia","preference","drought periods","decline","xylem","sampling events","months","average"],"language":"en"},

The ultrastructural picture of intestinal EVD virus infection resembles that of TGE and other enteropathogenic coronaviruses. Virus replication, however, was observed mainly in enterocytes located on the lateral walls of the villi extending to the villus/crypt border, and sometimes virus\u2010infected cells were demonstrated in or near the Lieberk\u00FChn\u0027s crypts.

El curso de la infecci\u00F3n con el virus de la DVE se puede comparar con el de la GET. La atrofia de villosidades aparece, tal y como en la GET, en la totalidad del yeyuno y del \u00EDleon. A este respecto se diferencian los hallazgos de la infecci\u00F3n con el virus rota. Las modificaciones ent\u00E9ricas ultraestructurales en la infecci\u00F3n con el virus de la DVE corresponden a los de la GET y otros virus corona enteropat\u00F3genos.

A 60 days or longer inventory hold of all plasma donations is applied, to allow additional time to discard previous donations from potential seroconverting or otherwise rejectable donors.Elimination procedures minimize the low residual risk of transmitting pathogens, including unknown or previously undetected ones. Since the introduction 20 years ago of solvent\u2010detergent treatment, very effective against enveloped viruses (HIV, HBV, HCV, West Nile virus, SARS, avian influenza virus etc), there have been no known cases of transmission of this type of pathogens by products manufactured according to this procedure. Other inactivation procedures such as pasteurization, dry\u2010heat or nanofiltration may prove equally effective. In addition, dry\u2010heat treatment and nanofiltration are capable of effectively eliminating non\u2010enveloped viruses (HAV, B19 virus). Recent studies show that the B19 virus is much more sensitive to heat (in lyophilized state or by pasteurization) and acid pH than previously thought.Although there is no evidence for the transmission of classic transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) through blood or blood\u2010products transfusion, four possible cases have been reported in the United Kingdom involving transmission by non\u2010leukoreduced blood components of the agent that causes variant Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob Disease (vCJD), a disease linked to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which took place in that country. However, there are no cases of human TSE (classic or variant) transmission by plasma\u2010derived products. Analytical methods capable of detecting the vCJD agent in patients\u2019 brains (where high titres are found) and other tissues (such as the spleen, appendix and lymph nodes, where much lower concentrations are found) are unable to detect the agent in blood or plasma from patients with vCJD, even in the clinical phase of the disease. Experiments by Grifols and other groups show that the capacity of the production processes to eliminate vCJD agent models is many orders of magnitude greater than the maximum expected load of the agent. In this regard, the efficacy of precipitation, affinity chromatography, depth filtration and nanofiltration are particularly notable.","publish_time":"2007-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"JORQUERA, J.

The purpose of developing the ASPUA platform was to utilize the rapidity and simplicity of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) with the detection power of microarray hybridization. This is the first report of the combination of these two technologies, which allow for the completion of allele\u2010specific detection of 11 of the most frequent mutations causing hereditary hearing loss in under 5 hr. The ASPUA platform was validated by accurately analyzing 141 patient samples that had been previously genotyped for GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1. In addition, we also developed a simplified assay by using streptavidin\u2010coated magnetic beads instead of fluorescence for signal display that can be assessed through a conventional light microscope. We demonstrate that the ASPUA platform is rapid, cost\u2010effective, and easily\u2010used, and is especially appropriate for mutation detection in clinical genetic diagnostics.

Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed. Liver specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) using enhanced real\u2010time PCR was applied to look for evidence of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus infection. Marked accumulation of cells in mitosis was observed in two patients and apoptosis was observed in all three patients. Other common pathologic features included ballooning of hepatocytes and mild to moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. No eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma, cholestasis, fibrosis, or fibrin deposition was noted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed 0.5% to 11.4% of nuclei were positive for proliferative antigen Ki\u201067. RT\u2010PCR showed evidence of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus in the liver tissues, but not in the sera of all 3 patients. However, electron microscopy could not identify viral particles. No giant mitochondria, micro\u2010 or macro\u2010vesicular steatosis was observed. In conclusion, hepatic impairment in patients with SARS is due to SARS\u2010associated coronavirus infection of the liver. The prominence of mitotic activity of hepatocytes is unique and may be due to a hyperproliferative state with or without disruption of cell cycle by the coronavirus. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, specific therapy may be targeted to reduce viral replication and modify the disease course.

Groups of pigs were inoculated by aerosol with PRRSV followed by H1N1 at 3\u2010, 7\u2010 or 14\u2010day intervals. During the post\u2010H1N1 period, mean body temperatures, respiratory signs and mean weight gains in the PRRSV\u2010H1N1 inoculated groups were recorded and compared with those in uninoculated controls (experiments 1 and 2) or in singly virus\u2010inoculated pigs (experiment 3).

However, human melanoma cells are often deficient in antigen processing and this appears to play a role in their expansion and escape from immunosurveillance. For example, expression of the transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and TAP2) is down\u2010regulated in the mouse melanoma cell line B16F10. This results in a lack of tumor\u2010associated antigen processing, low surface expression of MHC Class I molecules and low immunogenicity. We observe that restoration of TAP1 expression by transfection resurrects the processing and presentation of viral antigens, and the melanoma\u2010associated antigen, TRP\u20102. Immunization with irradiated B16F10/rTAP1 transfected cells generates CTLs that are capable of killing B16F10/rTAP1 transfected targets and B16F10 targets deficient in TAP1. Furthermore, B16F10/rTAP1 transfectants grow at a significantly slower rate in mice than B16F10 cells. In an experimental model that closely recapitulates the clinical situation, treatment of B16F10 tumors in mice with a vaccinia virus vector expressing TAP1 also significantly decreases tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, tumors treated with vaccinia TAP1 had significantly reduced numbers of immunosuppressive, CD3(\u002B)/IL\u201010 positive, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Therefore, TAP1 expression restores both antigen presentation and immunogenicity in B16F10 melanoma cells and concomitantly reduces immunosuppressive IL\u201010 production at the local tumor site, thereby increasing immunosurveillance mechanisms against tumors. \u00A9 2007 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2007-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qian\u2010Jin; Seipp, Robyn P.; Chen, Susan S.; Vitalis, Timothy Z.; Li, Xiao\u2010Lin; Choi, Kyung\u2010Bok; Jeffries, Andrew; Jefferies, Wilfred A.","journal":"Int J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee2028f18c19056e6742d111157d17bb1019e0b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B16F10 cells","B16F10 melanoma cells","irradiated B16F10","B16F10 targets deficient","treatment of B16F10 tumors","associated antigen processing","vaccinia TAP1","restoration of TAP1 expression","antigen presentation","human melanoma cells","mouse melanoma cell line B16F10","rTAP1 transfected cells","lack of tumor","tumor growth","rTAP1 transfected targets","low immunogenicity","mice","rTAP1 transfectants","local tumor site","immunosuppressive IL","tumor infiltrating lymphocytes","low surface expression of MHC Class","metastatic disease","disease reoccurrence","immunosurveillance mechanisms","vaccinia virus vector","presentation of viral antigens","reduced numbers of immunosuppressive","development","molecules","CTLs","clinical situation","slower rate","production","transfection","transporters","CD3","Immunization","immune therapeutic strategies","expansion","escape","TRP","TAP2","experimental model","role","results","example","Wiley","Liss"],"language":"en"},

The susceptibility to spontaneous disease is dependent on exposure to microbial antigens, MBP TCR transgenic models expressing TCRs specific for the same epitope of MBP but utilizing different V(\u03B1) genes exhibit differing susceptibilities to, spontaneous disease.

Both methods detected influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, human parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) types A and B, and human adenoviruses. In addition, human coronavirus (hCoV) groups I (229E\u2010like) and II (OC43\u2010like), as well as the new human metapneumovirus (hMPV), types A and B, were searched for by RT\u2010PCR alone. When results obtained by both methods were added, the overall percentage of patients positive for at least one respiratory virus peaked at 44.2%, involving 92/208 patients (81 pediatric, and 11 adults), while 116 patients (55.8%) were negative for any respiratory virus tested. The most common circulating virus was hRSV, infecting 54 (25.9%) patients (24 type A, and 30 type B strains), followed by hMPV, infecting 12 (5.8%) patients (7 type A and 5 type B strains). Coinfections by two respiratory viruses interested 11 (5.3%) patients, and 9 (81.8%) of these were infected by hRSV in association with another respiratory virus. In the great majority of infected children, hRSV and hMPV were associated with lower respiratory tract infections. In lung transplant recipients, viruses present in bronchoalveolar lavage appeared to be associated frequently with lower respiratory tract infections. In conclusion: the combination of immunological and molecular assays is the most sensitive approach to the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections; and infections caused by the less investigated hCoVs and hMPVs represent a fair proportion of respiratory infections.

On the basis of careful retrospective analysis of hospital case records it was concluded that in 28 cases with an increase of OC43 antibody litres, and in two with titre decrease, a disease could be associated with an acute coronavirus infection. In 16 cases the disease was dominated by respiratory symptoms. Eight of these patients, four children and four adults, had pneumonia. Three of the eight pneumonia patients had, however, another concomitant infection, too. Four patients had neurological symptoms, one had severe perimyocarditis, and in five cases fever was the only symptom recorded. Among the patients with a statistically significant high titre of OC43 antibodies, there were 14 cases where a suggestive association with a disease could be envisaged on the basis of hospital records.

Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus particles in the diarrhea fluid sample and the infected HRT\u201018 cell cultures. This virus possessed hemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities and caused cytopathic effects in HRT\u201018 cells but not in MDBK, GBK and FE cells. One of four S\u2010specific monoclonal antibodies reacted in Western blots with HECV\u20104408, BCV\u2010L9 and BCV\u2010LY138 but not with HCV\u2010OC43, and two reacted with BCV\u2010L9 but not with HECV\u20104408, BCV\u2010LY138 and HCV\u2010OC43. One S\u2010specific and two N\u2010specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains. cDNA encompassing the 3\u2032 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV\u2010L9 and BCV\u2010LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV\u2010OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV\u20104408 and BCV. A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the nonstructural genes of HCV\u2010OC43 was not detected in HECV\u20104408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV\u20104408 and the virulent wild\u2010type BCV. Forty\u2010nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV\u20104408 and HCV\u2010OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV\u20104408 and BCVLY138.

Telbivudine is an orally bioavailable L\u2010nucleoside with potent and specific anti\u2010hepatitis B virus activity. The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti\u2010HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T\u2010cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV\u20103)\u2010induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV\u20103\u2010infected macrophages, and the effects on T\u2010cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV\u20103\u2010induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV\u20103 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03B1 and interleukin\u201012 was increased significantly in MHV\u20103\u2010induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine\u2010treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon\u2010\u03B3 were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV\u20103\u2010infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin\u20104 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV\u20103\u2010induced hepatitis.","publish_time":"2010-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Z.

The multiplex RT\u2010nested PCR assay has been used widely for simultaneous detection of non\u2010related viruses involved in infectious diseases because of its high specificity and sensitivity. A new multiplex RT\u2010PCR assay is described in this report. This approach includes nested primer sets targeted to conserve regions of human parainfluenza virus haemagglutinin, human coronavirus spike protein, and human enterovirus and rhinovirus polyprotein genes. It permits rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection and typing of the four types of parainfluenza viruses (1, 2, 3, 4AB), human coronavirus 229E and OC43, and the generic detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The testing of 201 clinical specimens with this multiplex assay along with other one formerly described by our group to simultaneously detect and type the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and a generic detection of all serotypes of adenovirus, covers the detection of most viruses causing respiratory infectious disease in humans. The results obtained were compared with conventional viral culture, immunofluorescence assay, and a third multiplex RT\u2010PCR assay for all human parainfluenza viruses types described previously. In conclusion, both multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays provide a system capable of detecting and identifying simultaneously 14 different respiratory viruses in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity, being useful for routine diagnosis and survey of these viruses within the population.

It was found that the SARS coronavirus entered the cells through membrane fusion instead of endocytosis, and then the nucleocapsids assembled in the RER and matured by budding into the smooth vesicles, which were derived from the Golgi apparatus. The smooth vesicles fused with the cell membrane, and the mature particles were released. A special phenomenon was that some virus\u2010like particles appeared in the nucleus.

Challenging winter conditions (i.e., low ambient temperature and decreased food availability) can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. Coping with these challenges can also indirectly increase morbidity and mortality by increasing glucocorticoid secretion, which can compromise immune function. Many environmental challenges are recurrent and thus predictable; animals could enhance survival, and presumably increase fitness, if they could anticipate immunologically challenging conditions in order to cope with these seasonal threats to health. The annual cycle of changing photoperiod provides an accurate indicator of time of year and thus allows immunological adjustments prior to the deterioration of conditions. Pineal melatonin codes day length information. Short day lengths enhance several aspects of immune function in laboratory studies, and melatonin appears to mediate many of the enhanced immunological effects of photoperiod. Generally, field studies report compromised immune function during the short days of autumn and winter. The conflict between laboratory and field data is addressed with a multifactor approach. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic tissue size and structure, as well as immune function and disease processes, is reviewed. The role of pineal melatonin and the hormones regulated by melatonin is discussed from an evolutionary and adaptive functional perspective. Finally, the clinical significance of seasonal fluctuations in immune function is presented. Taken together, it appears that seasonal fluctuations in immune parameters, mediated by melatonin, could have profound effects on the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. An adaptive functional perspective is critical to gain insights into the interaction among melatonin, immune function, and disease processes.","publish_time":"2007-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Randy J.; Demas, Gregory E.; Klein, Sabra L.; Kriegsfeld, Lance J.","journal":"J Pineal Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2026fae2351a8f19c31febc573e7ea6b7a51af9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aspects of immune function","immune parameters","seasonal threats","role of pineal melatonin","clinical significance of seasonal fluctuations","significant seasonal cycles of illness","challenging conditions","Challenging winter conditions","well\u2010documented seasonal cycles of mating","Pineal melatonin codes day length information","death","laboratory studies","adaptive functional perspective","deterioration of conditions","disease processes","enhanced immunological effects of photoperiod","Short day lengths","field studies report","field data","immunological adjustments","profound effects","nonhuman animals","environmental challenges","short days of autumn","annual cycle of changing photoperiod","low ambient temperature","birth","structure","decreased food availability","lymphatic tissue size","progression of diseases","accurate indicator of time","humans","etiology","year","addition","insights","interaction","glucocorticoid secretion","morbidity","evidence","order","hormones","mortality","survival","hypothermia","starvation","animal populations","conflict","multifactor approach","shock","health","fitness"],"language":"en"},

Melatonin has been shown to prevent paralysis and death in mice infected with the encephalomyocarditis virus and to decrease viremia. Melatonin also postpones the onset of the disease produced by Semliki Forest virus inoculation and reduces the mortality of West Nile virus\u2010infected mice stressed by either isolation or dexamethasone injection. An increase in the host resistance to the virus via a peripheral immunostimulatory activity is considered responsible for these effects. It has also been demonstrated that melatonin protects some strains of mink against Aleutian disease, and prevents the reduction of B\u2010 and T\u2010cells as well as Th1 cytokine secretion in mice infected with leukemia retrovirus. In VEE\u2010infected mice, melatonin postpones the onset of the disease and death for several days and reduces the mortality rate. This protective effect seems to be due to the increase in the production of interleukin\u20101\u03B2 (IL\u20101\u03B2), as 100% of the infected mice treated with melatonin die when IL\u20101\u03B2 is blocked with antimurine IL\u20101\u03B2 antibodies. Although melatonin administration raises serum levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF\u2010\u03B1) and interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03B3), the mortality observed in neutralization experiments with the corresponding anticytokine antibodies, suggests that neither TNF\u2010\u03B1 nor IFN\u2010\u03B3 are essential for the protective effect of melatonin on murine VEE virus infection. Melatonin treatment also enhances the efficiency of immunization against the VEE virus. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the dissemination of this virus, and their deleterious effects may be diminished by melatonin. This indole inhibits nitric oxide synthetase activity and it is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide, which also plays an important role in the spread of the VEE virus. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects of melatonin suggest that this indole must be considered as an additional therapeutic alternative to fight viral diseases.","publish_time":"2004-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonilla, Ernesto; Valero, Nereida; Chac\u00EDn\u2010Bonilla, Leonor; Medina\u2010Leendertz, Shirley","journal":"J Pineal Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c5f74e9afcffffb1e6e013a413fd3e50d6319f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Melatonin"],"organizations":["Semliki Forest"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["melatonin administration","Melatonin treatment","therapeutic effects of melatonin","neuroprotective effects of melatonin","protective effect of melatonin","infected mice","encephalomyocarditis virus","murine VEE virus infection","mortality of West Nile virus","\u03B2 antibodies","Semliki Forest virus inoculation","deleterious effects","TNF","Aleutian disease","IFN","onset","mortality rate","indole","antimurine IL","death","increase","nitric oxide synthetase activity","viral infections","viral diseases","potent scavenger of nitric oxide","peripheral immunostimulatory activity","additional therapeutic alternative","corresponding anticytokine antibodies","serum levels of tumor necrosis factor","alpha","emphasis","Th1 cytokine secretion","cells","neutralization experiments","interferon","antioxidant","Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis","efficiency of immunization","gamma","days","isolation","strains of mink","spread","reduction of B","leukemia retrovirus","host resistance","production of interleukin","important role","paralysis","dexamethasone injection","Reactive oxygen species","conclusion","dissemination","viremia"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial viruses (A\u0026B) were detectable in 45 of 84 (53.6%) nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants with bronchiolitis, whereas coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses were not detectable in the same samples. Adenoviruses were detectable by PCR in 11 of 84 (13.1%) nasopharyngeal swabs.

Respiratory syncytial viruses, human rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses occur in dual infections detected in 18 of 84 (21.4%) respiratory samples tested.

Accumulation of natural killer (NK) cells at day 3 postinfection (p.i.) was shown to be radiation\u2010sensitive, implying that proliferation was required for this response. Accumulation occurred in splenectomized mice, indicating that the spleen, known to be an organ for mature NK cell proliferation, was not the major source for liver and peritoneal NK/LGL. Significant percentages (\u003E 25%) of the LGL found in the liver and peritoneal cavity following viral infection or interferon induction with poly\u2010inosinic:pory\u2010cytidylic acid were defined morphologically as blasts (large cells with prominent nucleoli and intensely basophilic cytoplasms containing azurophilic granules). Most blast LGL at day 3 p.i. were sensitive to administration of anti\u2010asialo GM(1) serum in vivo, were Lyt\u20102(\u2010), and were enriched in populations that lysed NK cell\u2010sensitive targets in vitro, indicating that these were NK/LGL. At day 3 p.i., leukocytes from the liver and peritoneal cavity incorporated (3)H\u2010thymidine and bound to and killed NK cell\u2010sensitive targets in single\u2010cell cytotoxicity assays.

All clinical settings, including rehabilitative and infirmary setting, have actively involved in fighting against the infection. The intent of this paper was to reflect on the SARS precautionary measures that had been taken in a severe intellectual disabilities hospital in Hong Kong. Methods A review on six SARS precautionary measures were conducted. They were assessment of risk, formulation of operational guidelines, implementation of infection control measures, education and training of staff, conducting audits and carrying out environmental improvement work. Results Patients were at risk of getting infected from carers, visitors, volunteers, and staff and patients of general hospitals. A SARS Quarantine Unit, isolation ward, was opened to isolate patients who might have had close contact with SARS patients during a stay in a general hospital or when they returned from home leave. Undoubtedly, both staff and relatives participated in preventing the patients from being infected. No day leave and home leave was reported and the number of hospitalization in general hospital was decreased during the critical period. Three infection control audits were conducted and improvement work was carried out subsequently. Conclusion The practice of grouping within a standard isolation room is recommended to continue in the future. Moreover, intensive infection control training for all staff is of highest importance to safeguard the health of both staff and patient.","publish_time":"2005-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, S.

Chronic stress and depression can result in general dysregulation of the immune system, of both cellular and humoral pathways, which may contribute to pathogenic infection and concomitant periodontal tissue destruction. In general, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that stress can modify the host defense and progression of periodontal infections in patients susceptible to periodontitis. However, substantial evidence also indicates that these conditions can mediate risk for disease, including periodontitis, through changes in health\u2010related behaviors, such as oral hygiene, smoking and diet. The unequivocal interpretation of studies has also been hampered, in part, by issues related to conceptualization of stress and depression, as well as commonly associated comorbidities, such as diabetes, that can modify the onset and progression of periodontal disease. In addition, stress and depression appear to fall into a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, involving a complex interaction of genetic background, coping strategies and environment. Differences in the conceptualization of stress and depression are probably important in assessing associations with other biologic and clinical measures. Future studies are necessary to clarify the complex interactions of chronic stress and depression in periodontal diseases.","publish_time":"2013-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warren, Kimberly R.; Postolache, Teodor T.; Groer, Maureen E.; Pinjari, Omar; Kelly, Deanna L.; Reynolds, Mark A.","journal":"Periodontol 2000","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/069e01eca6165b6e6ed9bff0423005edbb3c2ddc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["depression","conceptualization of stress","complex interactions of chronic stress","progression of periodontal disease","negative impact of chronic psychological stress","periodontal diseases","clinical evidence","progression of periodontal infections","immune system","periodontitis","substantial evidence","health","concomitant periodontal tissue destruction","clinical measures","general dysregulation","related behaviors","Future studies","unequivocal interpretation of studies","complex interaction of genetic background","pathogenic infection","host defense","oral hygiene","associations","changes","patients susceptible","extensive body of experimental","strategies","conditions","onset","hypothesis","diabetes","smoking","diet","environment","humoral pathways","risk","spectrum","associated comorbidities","issues","Differences","addition"],"language":"en"},

However, chronic lesions with subsequent functional impairment result from eventual failure of the remyelination process, as seen in multiple sclerosis. Studies using animal models of successful remyelination delineate a progression of events facilitating remyelination. A universal feature of this repair process is extensive proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPs) in response to demyelination. To investigate signals that regulate OP proliferation in response to demyelination we used murine hepatitis virus\u2010A59 (MHV\u2010A59) infection of adult mice to induce focal demyelination throughout the spinal cord followed by spontaneous remyelination. We cultured glial cells directly from demyelinating and remyelinating spinal cords using conditions that maintain the dramatically enhanced OP proliferative response prior to CNS remyelination. We identify PDGF and FGF2 as significant mitogens regulating this proliferative response. Furthermore, we demonstrate endogenous PDGF and FGF2 activity in these glial cultures isolated from demyelinated CNS tissue. These findings correlate well with our previous demonstration of increased in vivo expression of PDGF and FGF2 ligand and corresponding receptors in MHV\u2010A59 lesions. Together these studies support the potential of these pathways to function in vivo as critical factors in regulating remyelination. \u00A9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A review of variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease is followed by a discussion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Two articles on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection address the association between viral infection and neoplasia, as do reviews on viruses and lymphoma/leukaemia, and Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8, HHV8). The section on viral disease concludes with an article on morbilliviruses. The intracellular effects of bacteria are addressed in a review of Listeria infection and a further review outlines recent advances in our knowledge of syphilis. Reviews on Helicobacter and gastric neoplasia, innate defences against methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, and the function of granulomas in tuberculosis also address aspects of tissue responses to bacterial infection. Following a review of the function of immunoglobulin A in defence against infection, a group of articles considers vaccination and gene therapy approaches, the latter involving consideration of both viral and bacterial strategies. The reviews assembled here bridge several gaps: between microbiology and cellular pathology; between host and infecting organism; and between disease and therapy. It is clear that cell and tissue pathology approaches are of value in all of these spheres, providing cell and tissue relevance to microbiological and immunological observations.

The mechanisms of many events induced by NO are now well defined, so that a fundamental understanding of NO biology is almost established. Accumulated evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. NO biosynthesis, particularly through expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), occurs in a variety of microbial infections. Although antimicrobial activity of NO is appreciated for bacteria and protozoa, NO has opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and certain other neurotropic virus infections. iNOS produces an excessive amount of NO for long periods, which allows generation of a highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, peroxynitrite, via a radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide. Thus, peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules. NO also appears to affect a host\u0027s immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, overproduction of NO in virus infections in mice is reported to suppress type 1 helper T-cell-dependent immune responses, leading to type 2 helper T-cell-biased immunological host responses. Thus, NO may be a host response modulator rather than a simple antiviral agent. The unique biological properties of NO are further illustrated by our recent data suggesting that viral mutation and evolution may be accelerated by NO-induced oxidative stress. Here, we discuss these multiple roles of NO in pathogenesis of virus infections as related to both non-specific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO during infections in vivo.","publish_time":"2000-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akaike, T; Maeda, H","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd1d562cb24b73a74830ca23e2c0cd02e609c8cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2327086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2327086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of virus infections","neurotropic virus infections","variety of microbial infections","influenza virus pneumonia","immunological host reactions","biased immunological host responses","helper T-cell","peroxynitrite","dependent immune responses","type","host response modulator","superoxide","iNOS","non-specific inflammatory responses","host\u0027s immune response","nitration reactions of various biomolecules","pathogenesis of various infectious diseases","Nitric oxide","oxidative stress","oxidative tissue injury","reactive nitrogen oxide species","potent oxidation","key molecules","diverse functions","generation","complex","oxygen radicals","radical coupling reaction","viral mutation","pathophysiological phenomena","simple antiviral agent","immunopathological consequences","effects","recent data","fundamental understanding","expression","long periods","evolution","synthase","overproduction","mice","Accumulated evidence","multiple roles","unique biological properties","bacteria","biology","protozoa","example","antimicrobial activity","mechanisms","events","biosynthesis"],"language":"en"},

Viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response. So far, the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza A viruses was mainly observed on the level of IFN\u03B2 gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses not only suppress IFN\u03B2 gene induction but also inhibit type I IFN signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) protein. Our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza A virus and subsequently stimulated with IFN\u03B1/\u03B2, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was strongly reduced. This impaired STAT1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA in the cell. SOCS proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Closer examination revealed that SOCS-3 but not SOCS-1 mRNA levels increase in an RNA- and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03BAB)-dependent but type I IFN-independent manner early in the viral replication cycle. This direct viral induction of SOCS-3 mRNA and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in SOCS-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated with elevated expression of type I IFN-dependent genes. As a consequence, progeny virus titers were reduced in SOCS-3 deficient cells or in cells were SOCS-3 expression was knocked-down by siRNA. These data provide the first evidence that influenza A viruses suppress type I IFN signaling on the level of JAK/STAT activation. The inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, which results in an impaired antiviral response.","publish_time":"2008-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pauli, Eva-K.; Schmolke, Mirco; Wolff, Thorsten; Viemann, Dorothee; Roth, Johannes; Bode, Johannes G.; Ludwig, Stephan","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2572141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2572141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK/STAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SOCS proteins","direct viral induction of SOCS","Viruses","protein expression","viral non-structural protein","gene expression","viral infections","accumulation of viral","elevated expression of type","action of viral proteins","level of IFN\u03B2 gene induction","deficient cells","IFN-dependent genes","viral replication cycle","IFN-independent manner","impaired STAT1 activation","impaired antiviral response","sustained phosphorylation of STAT1","level of JAK","activator of transcription protein","interferon antagonistic activity of influenza","STAT activation","triphosphate RNA","mRNA levels","present data","progeny virus titers","potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase","signal transducer","nuclear factor kappa B","NF-\u03BAB","system","line of defense","suppression","evidence","consequence","IFN\u03B1","various mechanisms","suppressor of cytokine","NS1","observation","Closer examination","inhibitory effect","study","siRNA"],"language":"en"},

We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce.

Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R)(4) (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequence-specific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R)(4)\u2013PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structure\u2013activity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.","publish_time":"2008-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abes, Rachida; Moulton, Hong M.; Clair, Philippe; Yang, Sung-Tae; Abes, Said; Melikov, Kamran; Prevot, Paul; Youngblood, Derek S.; Iversen, Patrick L.; Chernomordik, Leonid V.; Lebleu, Bernard","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6ce322684cccda1ff72e7dacf22da2259cf65c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2582615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMO","Chemical","CPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R-Ahx","PMO conjugates","splicing machinery","sequence-specific splicing correction","Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency","conjugated PMO","hydrophobicity","Chemical conjugation of PMO","heparin","cellular uptake","important clinical applications","hybridization of high affinity","cell culture","Arg-groups","CPP structural features important","significant correlation","clinical settings","limiting factor","efficient nuclear delivery","model heparan sulfate","model synthetic vesicles","RNase H- incompetent oligonucleotide analogs","arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides","mouse models of various viral infections","absence of endosomolytic agents","challenge","variance","ability","intracellular distribution","phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides","cytotoxic ones","Duchenne muscular dystrophy","systemic administration","steps","linker","conventional CPPs","aminohexanoic acid","Structure","activity relationship studies","splice","internalization pathway","active doses","charges","endosomal escape","Efforts"],"language":"en"},

Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p\u003C0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia.","publish_time":"2009-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuvim, Michael J.; Evans, Scott E.; Clement, Cecilia G.; Dickey, Burton F.; Gilbert, Brian E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2613561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza pneumonia","Influenza-related mortality","influenza epidemic","aerosolized bacterial lysate","possible causes of influenza","impaired host survival","lethal influenza infection","induced viral resistance","high mortality","excessive inflammation","viral challenge","mortality benefit","ineffective host response","excessive host inflammatory response","robust lung inflammation","viral replication","augmented inflammation","viral titers","Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs","major cause of mortality","lung injury","striking resistance","mice","vs","innate immune resistance","related death","live virus","inflammatory cytokines IL","year","TNF","pandemic episodes","impairment of gas exchange","tachyphylaxis","expression","data","ribavirin","BACKGROUND","millions of people","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","treatment","FINDINGS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy.","publish_time":"2009-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, De-Kuan; Lin, Chin-Tarng; Wu, Chien-Hsun; Wu, Han-Chung","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18e4bf7e0c2d81caa5795174a4f25d5a035e09b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2614347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeting peptide","targeting phage","tumor-specific peptide","tumor cells","tumor tissues","targeting liposomes","peptide library","tumor masses","NSCLC cell lines","NSCLC xenografts","novel peptide ligand","cognate synthetic peptide","treatment of NSCLC","lack of tumor specificity","WTY-mutated peptide","non-small cell lung cancer","enhanced cancer cell apoptosis","human lung cancer xenografts","surgical specimens of NSCLC","normal cells","leading cause of cancer","normal tissues","drug accumulation","effective chemotherapies","current study","ligand-mediated drug delivery system","survival rates of mice","higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin","major drawback","results","SCID","free drugs","chemotherapeutic agents","therapeutic index","fold","chemotherapy","severe combined immunodeficiency","dose","targeted gene transfer vectors","vinorelbine","related mortality","control","positive rate","ability","toxicities","diagnosis","malignancy"],"language":"en"},

It is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor.

Mice primed with M2-DNA and then boosted with recombinant adenovirus expressing M2 (M2-Ad) had enhanced antibody responses that cross-reacted with human and avian M2 sequences and induced T-cell responses. This M2 prime-boost vaccination conferred broad protection against challenge with lethal influenza A, including an H5N1 strain. Vaccination with M2, with key sequences represented, may provide broad protection against influenza A.","publish_time":"2007-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tompkins, Stephen Mark; Zhao, Zi-Shan; Lo, Chia-Yun; Misplon, Julia A.; Liu, Teresa; Ye, Zhiping; Hogan, Robert J.; Wu, Zhengqi; Benton, Kimberly A.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Epstein, Suzanne L.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dce54cded1eacab0a9aa40c210a4b27ea9fd2226.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2725899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2725899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M2-DNA","M2-Ad","avian M2 sequences","divergent M2 peptide","M2-specific antibody responses","lethal influenza","full-length consensus-sequence M2","M2 prime-boost vaccination","influenza viruses","specific influenza vaccines","Influenza matrix protein","broad protection","DNA vaccine","challenge","enhanced antibody responses","broader protection","induced T-cell responses","H5N1 strain","mice","shared consensus sequence","key sequences","vaccine candidate","conserved antigens","H5N1 subtype","regular reformulation of strain","recombinant adenovirus","Changes","antibodies","efficacy","subtypes"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Three samples of pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from China, Ghana, and the United States (U.S.). Participants completed a survey that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R, an optimism/pessimism measure), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and questions addressing health and demographic factors. A three-country set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with optimism/pessimism. RESULTS: LOT-R scores varied significantly across cultures in these samples, with Ghanaian pregnant women being the most optimistic and least pessimistic and Chinese pregnant women being the least optimistic overall and the least pessimistic in subscale analysis. Four key variables predicted approximately 20% of the variance in overall optimism scores: country of origin (p = .006), working for money (p = .05); level of education (p = .002), and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication (p \u003C .001). Quality of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure. U.S. pregnant women reported far lower vitality scores than both Chinese and Ghanaian pregnant women in our sample. CONCLUSION: This research raises important questions regarding what it is about country of origin that so strongly influences optimism/pessimism among pregnant women. Further research is warranted exploring underlying conceptualization of optimism/pessimism and health related quality of life across countries.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moyer, Cheryl A; Yang, Huixia; Kwawukume, Yao; Gupta, Anu; Zhu, YuChun; Koranteng, Isaac; Elsayed, Yasmin; Wei, YuMei; Greene, Jonathan; Calhoun, Cecilia; Ekpo, Geraldine; Beems, Megan; Ryan, Megan; Adanu, Richard; Anderson, Frank","journal":"BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f43e2e8087f69f1fd27714d2f600d66321d8f0e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2744663.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2744663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Life Orientation"],"locations":["U.S.","United States","Ghana"],"keyphrases":["samples of pregnant women","Chinese pregnant women","Ghanaian pregnant women","Quality of life scores","matching women","overall optimism scores","pessimism measure","quality of life measure","health-related quality of life","health related quality of life","country of origin","LOT-R scores","underlying conceptualization of optimism","vitality measure","country set","lower vitality scores","Life Orientation Test","cultures","subscale analysis","research","results","Multivariate regression analysis","gestational age","important questions","key variables","enrollment","final trimester","China","survey","Short Form","pronounced difference","countries","variance","number of previous pregnancies","comparisons","emotional issues","medication","CONCLUSION","SF","demographic factors","METHODS","United States","level of education","Anovas","model","Participants","cohorts","money","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecular-based diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.","publish_time":"2009-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fooks, Anthony R.; Johnson, Nicholas; Freuling, Conrad M.; Wakeley, Philip R.; Banyard, Ashley C.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Marston, Denise A.; Dastjerdi, Akbar; Wright, Edward; Weiss, Robin A.; M\u00FCller, Thomas","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6fde7aab8fedbe212cac83d89064d4fb74089b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2745658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of rabies","rabies diagnosis","development of tests","affordable rabies diagnostic tests","conventional tests","number of molecular tests","human rabies","rabies-endemic countries","clinical diagnosis","developing countries","development of rabies diagnostics","molecular techniques","application of molecular biology","advent of molecular biology","rapid detection of rabies virus","diagnostic assays","benefit of molecular methods","developing regions","differential diagnosis of human diseases","clinical specimens","diagnostic test developers","century","conventional assays","similar clinical symptoms","challenges","development of techniques capable of high throughput testing","routine use","Antemortem testing","technical nature","Adoption of rapid","logistical barriers","benefit ratio","accepted validation","low turnaround time","new technological initiatives","capability","importance of sharing","technology","advances","cost","tools","decades","viral strain identification","substantial improvements","laboratory twinning","poor healthcare infrastructure","exposures","disciplines","surveillance","quality","implementation","epidemiological information","fold","tendency","times","course","sample","expectation","areas","world","acceptance","organisations"],"language":"en"},

With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.","publish_time":"2010-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tracht, Samantha M.; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Hyman, James M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0a17b1f4447f0a81d2e93f2e23720feadee96cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2818714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of pandemic","effectiveness of facemasks","surgical facemasks","spread of influenza","H1N1 epidemics","spread of disease","N95 respirators","people","number of influenza","impact","population","outbreak of novel influenza","effective intervention strategy","mathematical model","studies","available data","vaccines","limited supplies of antivirals","countries","individuals","World Health Organization","SARS","infection","ways","parameter values","little research","Recent experiences","susceptibility","infectivity","results","options","cases"],"language":"en"},

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morrill, John C.; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Yoshikawa-Iwata, Naoko; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Won, Sungyong; Terasaki, Kaori; Zamoto-Niikura, Aya; Peters, C.

We investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed how the lipid modification of OspA affects the localization of the antigen in our delivery vehicle using a number of biochemistry techniques. Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively.

We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.","publish_time":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ha, Cam T.; Wu, Julie A.; Irmak, Ster; Lisboa, Felipe A.; Dizon, Anne M.; Warren, James W.; Ergun, Suleyman; Dveksler, Gabriela S.","journal":"Biology of Reproduction","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/004f0f69464edd5466a947da86d38cea9fe7e4fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2888962.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/83/1/27/10573911/biolreprod0027.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PSG1 function","PSG1 treatment","PSG1 activity","TGFB1","possible functions of PSGs","endothelial cells","endothelial tube formation","vascular endothelial growth factors","binding of PSGs","possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors","placental growth factor","transforming growth factor beta","human pregnancy specific beta","cell types","N-domain","human monocytes","T-cell function","PGF","human extravillous trophoblast cell lines","possible direct interaction","maternal serum","important role","potential role","absence of VEGFA","diverse functions","proangiogenic properties","essential regions","functional activity","maternal-fetal interface","protein levels","vasculature","glycoproteins","macrophages","wound healing assays","VEGFs","presence","Previous studies","abundant PSG","establishment","addition","immunomodulatory roles","salt bridge","amino acids","present study","induction of VEGFC","regulation","aspartic acid","position","mutagenesis","Site"],"language":"en"},

Although both extrinsic death-receptor signaling pathways and intrinsic pathways involving mitochondrial injury are implicated in reovirus-induced apoptosis, mechanisms by which either of these pathways are activated and their relationship to NF-\u03BAB signaling following reovirus infection are unknown. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-\u03BAB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus. Decreased reovirus virulence in Bid-null mice was accompanied by a reduction in viral yield.

We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon\u0027s mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells\u0027 transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell\u0027s transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.","publish_time":"2010-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berretta, Regina; Moscato, Pablo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab371ed38caa53c720fd4c0333e1bf4de84550f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2923618.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2923618/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shannon"],"organizations":["The Information Theory","Normalized Shannon"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["progression of cancer cells","prostate cancer datasets","transcriptional changes progression","established biomarkers of cancer progression","divergence of cancer cells\u0027 transcriptional profiles","new unifying hallmark of cancer","progression of melanoma","Jensen-Shannon divergence","cancer cell\u0027s transcriptome changes lead","sudden transcriptional changes","high-throughput methods","molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes","gradual changes","transcriptional state","tumor cells","gene expression profiles","high-throughput technologies","Information Theory measures","malignant phenotypes","processes","high-througput technologies","METHODOLOGY","proposed methods","arrow of time","Shannon\u0027s mathematical theory of communication","measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values","principle applicable","novel biomarkers","microarray datasets available","deep mathematical basis","public domain","disorder","quantitative guiding rule","normal tissue profile","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","large number of genes","accepted belief","creation of states","approach","general applicability","diseases","SIGNIFICANCE","relevance","originating tissues","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","variations"],"language":"en"},

INTRODUCTION: Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants. Widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights about its etiology, but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear. METHODS: Seventy-seven infants with bronchiolitis who were under two years of age and visited an emergency unit were included. Using molecular-based methods, samples were tested for 12 different respiratory viruses. Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints: hospital admission and ICU admission. RESULTS: We identified at least one virus in 93.5% of patients, and coinfections were found in nearly 40% of patients. RSV was the most common pathogen (63.6%), followed by rhinovirus (39%). Identification of RSV was only associated with an increased risk of hospital admission in the univariate model. Younger age and enterovirus infection were associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, while atopy of a first-degree relative showed a protective effect. Prematurity was associated with an increased risk of admission to the ICU. Coinfections were not associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular-based methods resulted in high rates of viral identification but did not change the significant role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis. Younger age and enterovirus infection were risk factors for hospital admission, while prematurity appeared to be a significant risk factor for admission to the ICU in acute viral bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2010-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nascimento, Milena Siciliano; de Souza, Andr\u00E9a Vieira; de Souza Ferreira, Adriana Vada; Rodrigues, Joaquim Carlos; Abramovici, Sulim; da Silva Filho, Luiz Vicente Ferreira","journal":"Clinics (Sao Paulo)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/924dc69ab73fbedf0c55ba2f7cd22e76710512ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2999709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU admission","increased risk of admission","increased risk of hospital admission","risk factors","acute bronchiolitis","acute viral bronchiolitis","molecular-based methods","significant risk factor","infants","Younger age","Identification of RSV","enterovirus infection","years of age","significant role of RSV","Prematurity","coinfections","patients","high rates of viral identification","impact of viral etiologies","Widespread use of molecular","early outcomes","emergency unit","worse outcomes","intensive care unit","different respiratory viruses","admissions","main endpoints","samples","atopy","major cause of morbidity","new insights","virological variables","etiology","univariate model","protective effect","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","Logistic regression models","common pathogen","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","publish_time":"2011-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamb, Daniel; Sch\u00FCttelkopf, Alexander W.; van Aalten, Daan M.

However, lungs are soft tissues with complex three-dimensional configuration. Conventional X-ray imaging is based purely on absorption resulting in very low contrast when imaging soft tissues without contrast agents. It is difficult to obtain adequate information of lung lesions from conventional X-ray imaging. METHODS: In this study, a recently emerged imaging technique, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) was used. This powerful technique enabled high-resolution investigations of soft tissues without contrast agents. We applied IL-XPCI to observe the lungs in an intact mouse for the purpose of defining quantitatively the micro-structures in lung. FINDINGS: The three-dimensional model of the lung was successfully established, which provided an excellent view of lung airways. We highlighted the use of IL-XPCI in the visualization and assessment of alveoli which had rarely been studied in three dimensions (3D). The precise view of individual alveolus was achieved. The morphological parameters, such as diameter and alveolar surface area were measured. These parameters were of great importance in the diagnosis of diseases related to alveolus and alveolar scar. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that IL-XPCI had the ability to represent complex anatomical structures in lung. This offered a new perspective on the diagnosis of respiratory disease and may guide future work in the study of respiratory mechanism on the alveoli level.","publish_time":"2011-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lu; Li, Dongyue; Luo, Shuqian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c45bdd7e23c8ea6b0dfb04d48a5ceda8f022597.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3045447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL-XPCI","imaging soft tissues","Conventional X-ray imaging","contrast agents","line X-ray phase contrast imaging","emerged imaging technique","low contrast","use of IL","excellent view of lung airways","adequate information of lung lesions","Early detection of lung cancer","high-resolution investigations of soft tissues","lungs","study of respiratory mechanism","diagnosis of respiratory disease","complex three-dimensional configuration","complex anatomical structures","powerful technique","diagnosis of diseases","three-dimensional model","alveolar scar","micro-structures","precise view of individual alveolus","alveoli level","assessment of alveoli","morphological parameters","alveolar surface area","future work","diameter","ability","purpose","great importance","BACKGROUND","visualization","absorption","new perspective","intact mouse","results","chances of successful treatment","FINDINGS","CONCLUSION","dimensions","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

There is a major trend towards the formation of large unbranched fruiting bodies, which is correlated with the use of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a secreted signal to coordinate cell aggregation. The role of cAMP in aggregation arose through co\u2010option of a pathway that originally acted to coordinate fruiting body formation. The genotypic changes that caused this innovation and the role of dynamic cAMP signaling in defining fruiting body size and pattern throughout social amoeba evolution are discussed.

For most infected individuals, symptoms were mild and self-limited; however, a small number developed a more severe clinical syndrome characterized by profound respiratory failure with hospital mortality ranging from 10 to 30%. While supportive care and neuraminidase inhibitors are the main treatment for influenza, data from observational and interventional studies suggest that the course of influenza can be favorably influenced by agents not classically considered as influenza treatments. Multiple observational studies have suggested that HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can exert a class effect in attenuating inflammation. The Collaborative H1N1 Adjuvant Treatment (CHAT) Pilot Trial sought to investigate the feasibility of conducting a trial during a global pandemic in critically ill patients with H1N1 with the goal of informing the design of a larger trial powered to determine impact of statins on important outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-national, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of once daily enteral rosuvastatin versus matched placebo administered for 14 days for the treatment of critically ill patients with suspected, probable or confirmed H1N1 infection. We propose to randomize 80 critically ill adults with a moderate to high index of suspicion for H1N1 infection who require mechanical ventilation and have received antiviral therapy for \u2264 72 hours. Site investigators, research coordinators and clinical pharmacists will be blinded to treatment assignment. Only research pharmacy staff will be aware of treatment assignment. We propose several approaches to informed consent including a priori consent from the substitute decision maker (SDM), waived and deferred consent. The primary outcome of the CHAT trial is the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in the study. Secondary outcomes will evaluate adherence to medication administration regimens, the proportion of primary and secondary endpoints collected, the number of patients receiving open-label statins, consent withdrawals and the effect of approved consent models on recruitment rates. DISCUSSION: Several aspects of study design including the need to include central randomization, preserve allocation concealment, ensure study blinding compare to a matched placebo and the use novel consent models pose challenges to investigators conducting pandemic research. Moreover, study implementation requires that trial design be pragmatic and initiated in a short time period amidst uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the pandemic.

Here, we describe the discovery and genetic characterization by direct pyrosequencing of two novel, divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey from Kibale National Park, Uganda. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. The two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within SHFV than has been documented within any other arterivirus. Both new variants nevertheless have the same 3\u2032 genomic architecture as the type strain, containing three open reading frames not present in the other arteriviruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results represent the first documentation of SHFV in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3\u2032 genetic architecture of SHFV relative to the other arteriviruses. They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within SHFV that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens.","publish_time":"2011-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauck, Michael; Hyeroba, David; Tumukunde, Alex; Weny, Geoffrey; Lank, Simon M.; Chapman, Colin A.; O\u0027Connor, David H.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Goldberg, Tony L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91312e3e01c328ebc4c8007586a84e8cfbdf45e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3081318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SHFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SHFV-krc1","documentation of SHFV","SHFV-krc2","new SHFV variants","divergent SHFV variants co-","SHFV type strain LVR","genetic architecture of SHFV relative","new variants","arteriviruses","degree of divergence","importance of wild primates","captive primates","degree of evolutionary divergence","results","nucleotide sequence identity","arterivirus species","greater phylogenetic diversity","host viral diversity","single individual","direct pyrosequencing","Simian hemorrhagic fever virus","novel pathogens","genetic characterization","genomic architecture","prior virus isolation","lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease","single male red colobus monkey","Kibale National Park","reservoirs","distribution","minimal PCR amplification","blood plasma","natural history","Uganda","discovery","BACKGROUND","open reading frames","knowledge","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","M6941","presence"],"language":"en"},

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn(2\u002B) and Mn(2\u002B). Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn(2\u002B) and Mn(2\u002B) induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn(2\u002B)/Mn(2\u002B) bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal a mechanism for uptake of metal ions in S. suis and this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation as to how SsTroA operates in metal transport.","publish_time":"2011-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Qiangmin; Gao, Jia; Han, Huiming; Li, Ming; Zhang, Jingren; Qi, Jianxun; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39b557ab42e265c37acee079b474c73708f197c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3097204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apo-SsTroA","uptake of metal ions","metal-bound protein","crystal structure of SsTroA","uptake of multiple metal ions","Zn","Mn","type metal transporters","scavenging ability of sufficient divalent metal ions","substrate binding protein","mechanism","epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates","pathogenic bacteria","TroA homologue","apo form","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","NMR data","different transition metals","ATP-binding cassette","pathogenic streptococcal toxic shock syndrome","STSS","nuclear magnetic resonance","ABC","ICP-MS","CD","circular dichroism","analysis","plasma mass spectrometry","nanomolar affinity","bacterial growth","spectra","distinct conformational changes","reasonable explanation","BACKGROUND","SIGNIFICANCE","function","site","complex","zinc","corresponding apoprotein","thermal unfolding","adjacent region","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","host"],"language":"en"},

Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns.

All patients were treated with oseltamivir from the first day of hospitalization. Upon admission 12/44 had local patchy shadowing in their chest x-ray and additionally antibiotic regimen was added to these patients as pneumonia was suspected based on clinical evidence.

The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck.

In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.","publish_time":"2011-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leckband, Deborah E.; Menon, Sindhu; Rosenberg, Kenneth; Graham, Sarah A.; Taylor, Maureen E.; Drickamer, Kurt","journal":"Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/134953face0c7475092ed130a40ebd194b99358b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3140775.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140775/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC-SIGNR result","DC-SIGNR variants","lengths of DC","DC-SIGNR extracellular domains","extracellular domain of DC","endothelial cell receptor DC-SIGNR","dendritic cell glycan-binding receptor DC-SIGN","different numbers","equivalent numbers of neck repeats","model","Force measurements","differences","results","different dispositions","glycan ligands","amino acid repeat sequences","distance measurements","carbohydrate-recognition domains","membrane-anchored ligand","variations","text","interaction","genetic polymorphisms","conformational change similar","rigid structure","membranes","crystallographic studies","findings","Image","addition","necks","crystals"],"language":"en"},

These artificial microbes can be genetically programmed to produce specific antigens at will. To show proof-of-concept for this artificial cell-based platform, a bacterial in vitro transcription and translation system together with a gene construct encoding the model antigen \u03B2-galactosidase were entrapped inside multilamellar liposomes. Vaccination studies in mice showed that such antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes (AnExILs) elicited higher specific humoral immune responses against the produced antigen (\u03B2-galactosidase) than control vaccines (i.e. AnExILs without genetic input, liposomal \u03B2-galactosidase or pDNA encoding \u03B2-galactosidase). In conclusion, AnExILs present a new platform for DNA-based vaccines which combines antigen production, adjuvanticity and delivery in one system and which offer several advantages over existing vaccine formulations.","publish_time":"2010-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amidi, Maryam; de Raad, Markus; Crommelin, Daan J.

Given the large number of proteins experimentally detected in the nucleolus and the central role of this subnuclear compartment in the cell, NoLSs are likely to be important regulatory elements controlling cellular traffic. Although many proteins have been reported to contain NoLSs, the systematic characterization of this group of targeting motifs has only recently been carried out. RESULTS: Here, we describe NoD, a web server and a command line program that predicts the presence of NoLSs in proteins. Using the web server, users can submit protein sequences through the NoD input form and are provided with a graphical output of the NoLS score as a function of protein position. While the web server is most convenient for making prediction for just a few proteins, the command line version of NoD can return predictions for complete proteomes. NoD is based on our recently described human-trained artificial neural network predictor. Through stringent independent testing of the predictor using available experimentally validated NoLS-containing eukaryotic and viral proteins, the NoD sensitivity and positive predictive value were estimated to be 71% and 79% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NoD is the first tool to provide predictions of nucleolar localization sequences in diverse eukaryotes and viruses.

Two short open reading frames (sORFs) initiated by AUGs 2 and 3 are also present. To understand translational regulation in this system, we systematically mutated AUGs 1\u20134 and monitored polypeptide synthesis from plasmids and recombinant viruses. This identified sORF2 as a key regulatory element with opposing effects on PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 expression. We propose a model in which AUGs 1\u20134 are accessed by leaky ribosomal scanning, with sORF2 repressing synthesis of downstream PB1-F2. However, sORF2 also up-regulates PB1-N40 expression, most likely by a reinitiation mechanism that permits skipping of AUG4. Surprisingly, we also found that in contrast to plasmid-driven expression, viruses with improved AUG1 initiation contexts produced less PB1 in infected cells and replicated poorly, producing virions with elevated particle:PFU ratios. Analysis of the genome content of virus particles showed reduced packaging of the mutant segment 2 vRNAs. Overall, we conclude that segment 2 mRNA translation is regulated by a combination of leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation, and that the sequences surrounding the PB1 AUG codon are multifunctional, containing overlapping signals for translation initiation and for segment-specific packaging.","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wise, Helen M.; Barbezange, Cyril; Jagger, Brett W.; Dalton, Rosa M.; Gog, Julia R.; Curran, Martin D.; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.; Anderson, Emma C.; Digard, Paul","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c3f2b400f5c75c6672de622b34de5332021a72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3177217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozgx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PB1-N40 expression","synthesis of downstream PB1-F2","virus segment","sORF2","mutant segment","mutated AUGs","segment-specific packaging","translation initiation","mRNA translation","combination of leaky ribosomal scanning","plasmid-driven expression","reduced packaging","recombinant viruses","polypeptide synthesis","reinitiation mechanism","improved AUG1 initiation contexts","genome content of virus particles","opposing effects","key regulatory element","polypeptides","overlapping signals","virions","sORFs","codon","short open reading frames","elevated particle","PFU ratios","system","plasmids","infected cells","Analysis","contrast","vRNAs","sequences","Influenza","translational regulation","AUG4","model"],"language":"en"},

These are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating CTLs. The polymorphism of the MHC effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species. We have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human MHC-I (also known as human leukocyte antigen class I, HLA-I) molecules, accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors, and HLA tetramers for specific CTL staining and manipulation. This has enabled a complete mapping of all HLA-I specificities (\u201Cthe Human MHC Project\u201D). Here, we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species. We systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine MHC-I molecule, SLA-1*0401, onto a HLA-I molecule (HLA-A*11:01), thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric MHC-I molecules as well as the intact SLA-1*0401 molecule. Biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptide-binding motifs of these molecules. A pan-specific predictor of peptide\u2013MHC-I binding, NetMHCpan, which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known HLA-I molecules, was successfully used to predict the specificities of the SLA-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric MHC-I molecules. These data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the Human MHC Project to other vertebrate species.

We investigated the profile of Th1 and Th17 mediators and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in groups with severe and mild nvA(H1N1) disease and correlated them with clinical aspects. METHODS: Thirty-two patients hospitalized with confirmed nvA(H1N1) infection were enrolled in the study: 21 patients with nvA(H1N1)-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 11 patients with mild disease. One group of 20 patients with bacterial sepsis-ARDS and another group of 15 healthy volunteers were added to compare their cytokine levels with pandemic influenza groups. In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, the serum cytokine samples were obtained on admission and 3 days later. The clinical aspects were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, obesity and lymphocytopenia were more common and IP-10, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03B1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-9 were significantly increased versus control. When comparing mild with severe nvA(H1N1) groups, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 and TNF\u03B1 were significantly higher in the severe group.

A positive correlation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-15 levels with C-reactive protein and with \u003E 5-day interval between symptom onset and admission, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio, were found in nvA(H1N1) groups. In obese patients with influenza disease, a significant increased level of IL-8 was found. When comparing viral ARDS with bacterial ARDS, the level of IL-8, IL-17 and TNF\u03B1 was significantly higher in bacterial ARDS and IL-12 was increased only in viral ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: In our critically ill patients with novel influenza A(H1N1) virus infection, the hallmarks of the severity of disease were IL-6, IL-15, IL-8 and TNF\u03B1. These cytokines, except TNF\u03B1, had a positive correlation with the admission delay and C-reactive protein, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio. Obese patients with nvA(H1N1) disease have a significant level of IL-8. There are significant differences in the level of cytokines when comparing viral ARDS with bacterial ARDS.","publish_time":"2010-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagau, Natalia; Slavcovici, Adriana; Gonganau, Daniel N; Oltean, Simona; Dirzu, Dan S; Brezoszki, Erika S; Maxim, Mihaela; Ciuce, Constantin; Mlesnite, Monica; Gavrus, Rodica L; Laslo, Carmen; Hagau, Radu; Petrescu, Magda; Studnicska, Daniela M","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1b85d059977fd5a8b5b5833fda83a5967360bab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3220006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IL","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1","significant level of IL","positive correlation of IL","significant increased level of IL","ARDS group","bacterial ARDS","viral ARDS","severe nvA","mild nvA","bacterial sepsis-ARDS","confirmed nvA","obese patients","ill patients","influenza disease","mild disease","severe group","TNF\u03B1","severity of disease","level of cytokines","negative correlation","pandemic influenza groups","novel influenza","admission delay","virus infection","C-reactive protein","cytokine levels","significant differences","IP","PaO","FiO","clinical aspects","ratio","days","interferon-inducible protein","serum cytokine samples","Th17 mediators","acute respiratory distress syndrome","tumor necrosis factor","lymphocytopenia","hallmarks","obesity","symptom onset","day interval","immune responses","profile of Th1","INTRODUCTION","healthy volunteers","interleukin","study","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","nonsurvivors","RESULTS","control"],"language":"en"},

However these methods are not well suited to specifically assess caspase-6 activity in the presence of other, confounding protease activities, as often encountered in cell and tissue samples. Here we report the development of a method that overcomes this limitation by using a protein substrate, lamin A, which is highly specific for caspase-6 cleavage at amino acid 230. Using a neo-epitope antibody against cleaved lamin A, we developed an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA assay that is suitable to specifically detect and quantify caspase-6 activity in highly apoptotic cell extracts. The method is more sensitive than VEID-based assays and can be adapted to a high-content imaging platform for high-throughput screening. This method should be useful to screen for and characterize caspase-6 inhibitor compounds and other interventions to decrease intracellular caspase-6 activity for applications in neurodegenerative disorders.","publish_time":"2011-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehrnhoefer, Dagmar E.; Skotte, Niels H.; Savill, Jane; Nguyen, Yen T.

The basic reproduction number, R(0), was estimated to be in the range of 1.6\u20132.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R(0), implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection.

Other subverted host RBPs help the assembly of the membrane-bound replicase complexes, regulate the activity of the replicase and control minus- or plus-strand RNA synthesis. Host RBPs also affect the stability of viral RNAs, which have to escape cellular RNA degradation pathways. While many host RBPs seem to have specialized functions, others participate in multiple events during infection.

These changes were observed by histological analysis with light microscopy and ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation was assessed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis. A series of characteristic apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies were noted. Apoptosis was readily observed in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs, and sporadically occurred in other organs after 3 days post-infection (PI). The presence and quantity of TUNEL-positive cells increased with infection time until 9 days PI. DNA extracted from the NGVEV-infected gosling cells displayed characteristic 180~200 bp ladders. Apoptotic cells were ubiquitously distributed, especially among lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells.

Structural data on the arrangement, stoichiometry and organisation of the component molecules of filoviruses has until now been lacking, partially due to the need to work under level 4 biological containment. The present study provides unique insights into the structure of this deadly pathogen. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the structure of Ebola virus using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, and single particle image processing. Here we report the three-dimensional structure and architecture of Ebola virus and establish that multiple copies of the RNA genome can be packaged to produce polyploid virus particles, through an extreme degree of length polymorphism. We show that the helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid containing RNA and nucleoprotein is stabilized by an outer layer of VP24-VP35 bridges. Elucidation of the structure of the membrane-associated glycoprotein in its native state indicates that the putative receptor-binding site is occluded within the molecule, while a major neutralizing epitope is exposed on its surface proximal to the viral envelope. The matrix protein VP40 forms a regular lattice within the envelope, although its contacts with the nucleocapsid are irregular. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate a modular organization in Ebola virus that accommodates a well-ordered, symmetrical nucleocapsid within a flexible, tubular membrane envelope.","publish_time":"2012-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beniac, Daniel R.; Melito, Pasquale L.; deVarennes, Shauna L.; Hiebert, Shannon L.; Rabb, Melissa J.; Lamboo, Lindsey L.; Jones, Steven M.; Booth, Timothy F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9104d87ad3991408937aa1e1739e7df0f51d01b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3256159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structure of Ebola virus","architecture of Ebola virus","virus particles","helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid","three-dimensional structure","symmetrical nucleocapsid","tubular membrane envelope","viral envelope","cryo-electron tomography","electron microscopy","combination of cryo","present study","RNA genome","membrane-associated glycoprotein","component molecules of filoviruses","sub-tomogram averaging","stoichiometry","nucleoprotein","native state","single particle image processing","organisation","regular lattice","multiple copies","outer layer of VP24","putative receptor-binding site","surface proximal","unique insights","modular organization","arrangement","VP35 bridges","major neutralizing epitope","matrix protein VP40","extreme degree of length polymorphism","filamentous animal viruses","level","Structural data","results","contacts","BACKGROUND","biological containment","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","deadly pathogen","METHODOLOGY","need","CONCLUSIONS","Elucidation"],"language":"en"},

Highly virulent SIV strains cause mortality of up to 10%. Importantly, pigs have long been considered \u201Cmixing vessels\u201D that generate novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, a constant threat to public health. Since its emergence in 2009 and subsequent pandemic spread, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) has been detected in pig farms, creating the risk of generating new reassortants and their possible infection of humans. Pathogenesis in SIV or H1N1pdm-infected pigs remains poorly characterized. Proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses are considered correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, and swine macrophages are found to be indispensible in effective clearance of SIV from pig lungs. In this study, we report a unique pattern of cytokine responses in swine macrophages infected with H1N1pdm. The roles of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the regulation of the host responses were examined. We found that proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03B1 were significantly induced and their induction was ERK1/2-dependent. IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-inducible antiviral Mx and 2\u20325\u2032-OAS were sharply induced, but the inductions were effectively abolished when ERK1/2 was inhibited. Induction of CCL5 (RANTES) was completely inhibited by inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which appeared also to regulate FasL and TNF-\u03B1, critical for apoptosis in pig macrophages. We found that NF\u03BAB was activated in H1N1pdm-infected cells, but the activation was suppressed when ERK1/2 was inhibited, indicating there is cross-talk between MAP kinase and NF\u03BAB responses in pig macrophages. Our data suggest that MAP kinase may activate NF\u03BAB through the induction of RIG-1, which leads to the induction of IFN-\u03B2 in swine macrophages.

Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) primarily exists in a latent state, while only 1\u20133% of cells support lytic infection at any specific time. KSHV reactivation from latency is an exceedingly intricate process mediated by the integration of viral and cellular factors. Previously, our lab has described early growth response-1 (Egr-1) as an essential component for the KSHV reactivation process via its ability to mediate transcription of KSHV ORF50, the gene encoding for replication and transcription activator (RTA), a viral component known to control the switch from latent to lytic infection. In here, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that Egr-1 binds KSHV ORF50 promoter (ORF50P) in at least two different GC-rich binding domains. Expression profiles of cellular egr-1 and KSHV-encoded ORF50 follow a similar pattern during de novo KSHV infection. Over-expressing Egr-1, a signaling component downstream of Raf\u003EMEK\u003EERK1/2, in KSHV-infected cells activates KSHV lytic replication. Through performing more physiologically relevant experiments, we analyzed the effect of a dietary supplement containing resveratrol on KSHV-infected cells. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate resveratrol to act in lowering ERK1/2 activity and expression of Egr-1 in KSHV-infected cells, resulting in the suppression of virus reactivation from latency. Taken together, these findings will undoubtedly contribute to future studies on not only combating KSHV related disease conditions, but also on other herpesviruses-induced pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2012-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dyson, Ossie F.; Walker, Lia R.; Whitehouse, Adrian; Cook, Paul P.; Akula, Shaw M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b20f25b48785e488fb280a76ec8f1da3bf8e2a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3299779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KSHV-infected cells","transcription of KSHV ORF50","KSHV reactivation process","KSHV lytic replication","KSHV-encoded ORF50","novo KSHV infection","binds KSHV ORF50 promoter","KSHV related disease conditions","expression of Egr","lytic infection","latency","Expression profiles of cellular egr","viral component","Over-expressing Egr","resveratrol","essential component","suppression of virus reactivation","integration of viral","transcription activator","lowering ERK1","cellular factors","relevant experiments","specific time","latent state","exceedingly intricate process","field of herpesvirus research","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","EMSA","similar pattern","ORF50P","ability","chromatin immunoprecipitation","exact molecular mechanism","effect","ChIP","RTA","electrophoretic mobility shift assays","switch","different GC-rich binding domains","dietary supplement","early growth response","activity","future studies","lab","Raf","MEK","herpesviruses-induced pathogenesis","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

The molecular target approach to drug screening is widely used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, because of the amount of knowledge now available regarding protein structure that has been obtained by computer simulation. The molecular target approach requires that the structure of target molecules, and an understanding of their physiological functions, is known. This approach to drug discovery may, however, limit the identification of novel drugs. As an alternative, the phenotypic- or pathway-screening approach to drug discovery is gaining popularity, particularly in the academic sector. This approach not only provides the opportunity to identify promising drug candidates, but also enables novel information regarding biological pathways to be unveiled. Reporter assays are a powerful tool for the phenotypic screening of compound libraries. Of the various reporter genes that can be used in such assays, those encoding secreted proteins enable the screening of hit molecules in both living cells and animals. Cell- and animal-based screens enable simultaneous evaluation of drug metabolism or toxicity with biological activity. Therefore, drug candidates identified in these screens may have increased biological efficacy and a lower risk of side effects in humans. In this article, we review the reporter bioassay systems available for phenotypic drug discovery.","publish_time":"2012-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiba, Takuya; Tsuchiya, Tomoshi; Mori, Ryoichi; Shimokawa, Isao","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b00b9f04112c671d8c31227d31b3fea7ca10c7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3304132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug screening","phenotypic drug discovery","pathway-screening approach","promising drug candidates","molecular target approach","Recent drug discovery efforts","simultaneous evaluation of drug metabolism","phenotypic screening of compound libraries","screening of hit molecules","biological activity","Reporter assays","high throughput screening","structure of target molecules","biological efficacy","biological pathways","reporter bioassay systems available","activity of discrete molecular targets","various reporter genes","protein structure","novel information","animal-based screens","large chemical libraries","identification of novel drugs","HTS","toxicity","powerful tool","lower risk","compounds","popularity","secreted proteins","knowledge","understanding","opportunity","effects","humans","cells","biotechnology industries","physiological functions","academic sector","animals","article","alternative","computer simulation"],"language":"en"},

These highly connected individuals may play an important role in case of an infectious disease outbreak. METHODS: We propose a novel strategy of finding and immunizing highly connected individuals and evaluate this strategy by computer simulations, using a stochastic, individual-and network-based simulation approach. A small random sample of the population is asked to list their acquaintances, and those who are mentioned most frequently are offered vaccination. This intervention is combined with case isolation and contact tracing. RESULTS: Asking only 10% of the population for 10 acquaintances each and vaccinating the most frequently named people strongly diminishes the magnitude of an outbreak which would otherwise have exhausted the available isolation units and gone out of control. It is extremely important to immunize all identified highly connected individuals. Omitting a few of them because of unsuccessful vaccination jeopardizes the overall success, unless non-immunized individuals are taken under surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy proposed in this paper is particularly successful because it attacks the very point from which the transmission network draws its strength: the highly connected individuals. Current preparedness and containment plans for smallpox and other infectious diseases may benefit from such knowledge.","publish_time":"2012-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidondo, Beatriz; Schwehm, Markus; B\u00FChlmann, Andrea; Eichner, Martin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e83992d4c17c4145b0b005bfab0f4513312a708e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3316139.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3316139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["connected individuals","population","non-immunized individuals","case isolation","novel strategy","acquaintances","infectious disease outbreak","infectious diseases","small minority","important role","transmission network","unsuccessful vaccination","large number of contacts","small random sample","available isolation units","network-based simulation approach","smallpox","overall success","containment plans","Current preparedness","computer simulations","strength","Social networks","point","vast majority","contact tracing","surveillance","BACKGROUND","magnitude","control","knowledge","paper","METHODS","intervention","people","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cell-cell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling.","publish_time":"2012-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clarke, Nicola E.; Fisher, Martin J.; Porter, Karen E.; Lambert, Daniel W.; Turner, Anthony J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/267084b4bdfd4a3d8fbdb8d7e4c935715f3e7171.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3327712.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE","FAK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell interactions","soluble ACE2","cleavage of ACE2","cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion","cell survival","integrin signalling","cell adhesion substrates","cell-extracellular matrix interactions","expression of Akt","sACE2","role","integrin subunits","signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt","cardioprotective functions","Inhibition of ACE","renin-angiotensin system","key catalytic components","plasma membrane","precise regulation of blood pressure","ACEs","proportion","pathology","cardiovascular disease","present evidence","process of pathological cardiac remodelling","RGD-independent manner","enzymes","failing heart","proliferation","effects","addition","FAK","mechanisms","results","ectodomain"],"language":"en"},

Very little is known about the pathogenesis, replication, virulence, and tropism of the other APMV serotypes. Here, this was evaluated for prototypes strains of APMV serotypes 2\u20139 in cell culture and in chickens and ducks. In cell culture, only APMV-1, -3 and -5 induced syncytium formation. In chicken DF1 cells, APMV-3 replicated with an efficiency approaching that of APMV-1, while APMV-2 and -5 replicated to lower, intermediate titers and the others were much lower. Mean death time (MDT) assay in chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old SPF chicks demonstrated that APMV types 2\u20139 were avirulent. Evaluation of replication in primary neuronal cells in vitro as well as in the brains of 1-day-old chicks showed that, among types 2\u20139, only APMV-3 was neurotropic, although this virus was not neurovirulent. Following intranasal infection of 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, replication of APMV types 2\u20139 was mostly restricted to the respiratory tract, although APMV-3 was neuroinvasive and neurotropic (but not neurovirulent) and also was found in the spleen. Experimental intranasal infection of 3-week-old mallard ducks with the APMVs did not produce any clinical signs (even for APMV-1) and exhibited restricted viral replication of the APMVs (including APMV-1) to the upper respiratory tract regardless of their isolation source, indicating avirulence of APMV types 1\u20139 in mallard ducks. The link between the presence of a furin cleavage site in the F protein, syncytium formation, systemic spread, and virulence that has been well-established with APMV-1 pathotypes was not evident with the other APMV serotypes.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Shive, Heather; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aff7baf924af877c824d6c9c1132caa094342636.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3340391.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of APMV types","avirulence of APMV types","prototypes strains of APMV serotypes","day-old chicks","Evaluation of replication","week-old mallard ducks","restricted viral replication","week-old chickens","APMVs","day-old SPF chicks","cell culture","neurovirulent","chicken DF1 cells","induced syncytium formation","upper respiratory tract","Experimental intranasal infection","chicken eggs","virulent strains","Avian paramyxovirus","primary neuronal cells","Newcastle disease virus","different avian species","assay","F protein","test","intracerebral pathogenicity index","high morbidity","MDT","ICPI","isolation source","furin cleavage site","economic loss","systemic spread","well-characterized serotype","Mean death time","presence","mortality","tropism","pathotypes","clinical signs","neuroinvasive","link","brains","pathogenesis","avirulent","efficiency","intermediate titers","spleen"],"language":"en"},

An extensive search was performed within 6 English and Chinese electronic database up to November 2011. Ninety-nine randomized controlled trails (RCTs) were collected, irrespective of languages. Two authors extracted data and assessed the trial quality independently. RevMan 5.0.2 was used for data analysis. Results. Compared with routine treatment and/or device support, SFI combined with routine treatment and/or device support showed better effect on clinical effect rate, mortality, heart rate, NT-proBNP and 6-minute walk distance. Results in ultrasonic cardiography also showed that SFI combined with routine treatment improved heart function of HF patients. There were no significant difference in blood pressure between SFI and routine treatment groups. Adverse events were reported in thirteen trails with thirteen specific symptoms, while no serious adverse effect was reported. Conclusion. SFI appear to be effective for treating HF. However, further rigorously designed RCTs are warranted because of insufficient methodological rigor in the majority of included trials.","publish_time":"2012-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen-Ting, Song; Fa-Feng, Cheng; Li, Xu; Cheng-Ren, Lin; Jian-Xun, Liu","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c62b68c066ad9cbdee5244b9b97e06d7286b2364.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3348640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["safety of SFI","routine treatment groups","heart rate","routine treatment improved heart function of HF patients","clinical effect rate","better effect","device support","Heart failure","serious adverse effect","Results","designed RCTs","Adverse events","data analysis","Chinese electronic database","randomized controlled trails","traditional Chinese patent medicine","mortality","blood pressure","insufficient methodological rigor","NT-proBNP","Shenfu injection","specific symptoms","Early literature studies","majority of included trials","global public health problem","significant difference","China","minute walk distance","efficacy","ultrasonic cardiography","trial quality","extensive search","RevMan","authors","Methods","article","Conclusion","Objective","languages"],"language":"en"},

However, detection of double-stranded RNAs in virus-infected cells promotes two concomitant and apparently conflicting events. The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2\u03B1) and inhibits protein synthesis, whereas cytosolic DExD/H box RNA helicases induce expression of type I-IFN and other cytokines. We demonstrate that the phosphatase-1 cofactor, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34/Ppp1r15a), an important component of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is absolutely required for type I-IFN and IL-6 production by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in response to dsRNA. GADD34 expression in MEFs is dependent on PKR activation, linking cytosolic microbial sensing with the ATF4 branch of the UPR. The importance of this link for anti-viral immunity is underlined by the extreme susceptibility of GADD34-deficient fibroblasts and neonate mice to Chikungunya virus infection.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clavarino, Giovanna; Cl\u00E1udio, Nuno; Couderc, Th\u00E9r\u00E8se; Dalet, Alexandre; Judith, Delphine; Camosseto, Voahirana; Schmidt, Enrico K.; Wenger, Till; Lecuit, Marc; Gatti, Evelina; Pierre, Philippe","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/226a0c0674dd9f9ad4a4e90ff6f03decb03457ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKR","UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein synthesis","GADD34 expression","expression of type","unfolded protein response","dsRNA-dependent protein kinase","MEFs","IFN","UPR","DNA damage-inducible protein","cytosolic microbial sensing","virus-infected cells","extreme susceptibility of GADD34","cytosolic DExD","deficient fibroblasts","PKR activation","Interferon production","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","Chikungunya virus infection","Nucleic acid sensing","H box RNA helicases","neonate mice","growth arrest","stranded RNAs","translation initiation factor","important component","cofactor","eIF2\u03B1","alpha","ATF4 branch","Ppp1r15a","key feature of antiviral responses","anti-viral immunity","link","detection of double","tissue protection","importance","phosphatase","conflicting events","cytokines"],"language":"en"},

A survey was conducted in order to assess the potential of Vietnamese and Cambodian live bird markets (LBMs) to sustain circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). Thirty Vietnamese and 8 Cambodian LBMs were visited, and structured interviews were conducted with the market managers and 561 Vietnamese and 84 Cambodian traders. Multivariate and cluster analysis were used to construct a typology of traders based on their poultry management practices. As a result of those practices and large poultry surplus (unsold poultry reoffered for sale the following day), some poultry traders were shown to promote conditions favorable for perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 in LBMs. More than 80% of these traders operated in LBMs located in the most densely populated areas, Ha Noi and Phnom Penh. The profiles of sellers operating at a given LBM could be reliably predicted using basic information about the location and type of market. Consequently, LBMs with the largest combination of risk factors for becoming virus reservoirs could be easily identified, potentially allowing control strategies to be appropriately targeted.

METHOD: Given a training set (50 BACE-1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive diverse compounds), three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and PCA, were judged by the hit number in the top 1% of the ranked list. The docking poses were generated by Surflex, five scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, and PMF_Score) were used for pose extraction. For each pose group, twelve scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, PMF_Score, LigScore1, LigScore2, PLP1, PLP2, jain, Ludi_1, and Ludi_2) were used for the pose rank. For a test set, 113,228 chemical compounds (Sigma-Aldrich\u00AE corporate chemical directory) were docked by Surflex, then ranked by the same three ranking methods motioned above to select the potential active compounds for experimental test. RESULTS: For the training set, the PCA approach yielded consistently superior rankings compared to conventional consensus scoring and single scoring. For the test set, the top 20 compounds according to conventional consensus scoring were experimentally tested, no inhibitor was found. Then, we relied on PCA scoring protocol to test another different top 20 compounds and two low micromolar inhibitors (S450588 and 276065) were emerged through the BACE-1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. CONCLUSION: The PCA method extends the conventional consensus scoring in a quantitative statistical manner and would appear to have considerable potential for chemical screening applications.","publish_time":"2012-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shu; Fu, Rao; Zhou, Li-Hua; Chen, Sheng-Ping","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7204b21080d07e2bb6ffc6fedaa1bf60ba5d67c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3372491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Principal Component Analysis","PCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional consensus scoring","individual scoring","single scoring","original scoring functions","alternative scoring protocol","chemical compounds","Surflex","BACE","test set","PCA method","PCA approach","training set","pose rank","chemical screening applications","potential active compounds","experimental test","virtual screening methods","inactive diverse compounds","ChemScore","re-rank","corporate chemical directory","results","PMF","Ludi","pose group","novel chemical classes of \u03B2","low micromolar inhibitors","considerable potential","ranking methods","ranked list","Sigma-Aldrich","PLP1","LigScore2","LigScore1","secretase","Principal Component Analysis","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","FRET","PLP2","superior rankings","assay","jain","order","quantitative statistical manner","S450588","information","BACKGROUND","docking poses","CONCLUSION","hit number","extraction"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cross-reactivity of anti-VP2 antibodies was detected between HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in mouse and human serum. The prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in Beijing, China, using a competition ELISA assay based on virus-like particles of HBoV1-4. The seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults (\u226515 years old; n = 142). The seropositive rate of HBoV1 was higher than that of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in individuals older than 0.5 years. Furthermore, IgG seroconversion of HBoV1 (10/31, 32.3%), HBoV2 (8/31, 25.8%), and HBoV3 (2/31, 6.5%) was found in paired sera collected from children with respiratory tract infections who were positive for HBoV1 according to PCR analysis.

Each virus also causes serious and commonly lethal infection of people as well as various species of domestic animals, however little is known about the associated mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats, Cedar virus (CedPV), which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses. The genome size (18,162 nt) and organization of CedPV is very similar to that of HeV and NiV; its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses; and it uses the same receptor molecule (ephrin- B2) for entry during infection. Preliminary challenge studies with CedPV in ferrets and guinea pigs, both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between CedPV and HeV or NiV lies within the coding strategy of the P gene, which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system. Unlike HeV, NiV, and almost all known paramyxoviruses, the CedPV P gene lacks both RNA editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved V protein. Preliminary study indicated that CedPV infection of human cells induces a more robust IFN-\u03B2 response than HeV.","publish_time":"2012-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marsh, Glenn A.; de Jong, Carol; Barr, Jennifer A.; Tachedjian, Mary; Smith, Craig; Middleton, Deborah; Yu, Meng; Todd, Shawn; Foord, Adam J.; Haring, Volker; Payne, Jean; Robinson, Rachel; Broz, Ivano; Crameri, Gary; Field, Hume E.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b46bb07c38382805a513fca0f0e47f9fd1eb5be7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3410871.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CedPV P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HeV","NiV","known henipaviruses","organization of CedPV","CedPV P gene","Hendra virus","virus replication","Cedar virus","Nipah virus","CedPV infection of human cells","known paramyxoviruses","lethal infection of people","pteropid bats act","nucleocapsid protein","coding capacity","clinical disease","coding strategy","Preliminary study","conserved V protein","Preliminary challenge studies","ferrets","new paramyxovirus","production of neutralizing antibodies","family Paramyxoviridae","guinea pigs","antigenic cross-reactivity","robust IFN-\u03B2 response","major genetic difference","RNA","main natural reservoir","ephrin- B2","host","characterization","various species of domestic animals","significant features","receptor molecule","genus Henipavirus","isolation","entry","important role","immune system","genome size","associated mechanisms of pathogenesis","context"],"language":"en"},

Studies of the association between the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene and HIV-1 susceptibility have produced controversial results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a meta-analysis of the data contained in the literature to clarify these findings. In total, 10 studies consisting of 2683 HIV-1 patients and 3263 controls (2130 healthy controls and 1133 HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were assessed in the main analyses. Further stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size were performed. By dividing the controls into two groups, healthy controls and HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) controls, we explored different genetic models to detect any association between the VNTR polymorphism and predisposition to HIV-1 infection. The results showed that the 5-repeat allele carriers (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73\u20130.96) and the 5/5 homozygous (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50\u20130.93) had significantly reduced risk when using the HIV-1 exposed but seronegative (HESN) as controls. The stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size confirmed these findings. However, a low to moderate degree of heterogeneity was also found across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the VNTR polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene is associated with a moderate effect on host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Similar to the 32-bp deletion in the chemokine receptor-5 gene (CCR5\u039432), the DC-SIGNR VNTR 5-repeat allele might have a role in resistance to HIV infection, particularly in Asian populations.","publish_time":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Yu, Xiao-Min; Wang, Jia-Xin; Hong, Ze-Hui; Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf0e3ed6e8fa4adbfacbf76e9fa2f5aa1ccdef19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3434151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VNTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV infection","healthy controls","DC-SIGNR VNTR","FINDINGS","DC-SIGNR gene","VNTR polymorphism","HESN","Studies","stratified analyses","association","host susceptibility","ethnicity","sample size","main analyses","moderate effect","variable number tandem repeat","allele carriers","controversial results","host-pathogen interaction","moderate degree of heterogeneity","Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","chemokine receptor","CCR5\u039432","predisposition","different genetic models","ORs","bp deletion","BACKGROUND","gp120 envelope glycoprotein","nonintegrin","role","resistance","groups","human immunodeficiency virus","CIs","data","confidence intervals","meta-analysis","Asian populations","patients","Odds ratios","literature","reduced risk","total","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Both innate and adaptive immunity have been shown to be important in controlling Brucella infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play critical roles in the host innate immune response, as well as development of adaptive immunity. In the current report, we investigated the role of TLR signaling in the clearance of Brucella and development of adaptive immunity in TLR2(\u2212/\u2212), TLR4(\u2212/\u2212), or MyD88(\u2212/\u2212) mice following aerosol exposure to B. melitensis 16 M. Consistent with previous reports, MyD88 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from all three organs (lung, spleen, and liver). The results reveal Th2-skewed immune responses in TLR2(\u2212/\u2212) mice late in infection and support a TLR2 requirement for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lungs, but not from the spleen or liver. Similarly, TLR4 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lung, but exhibits a minor contribution to clearance from the spleen and no demonstrable contribution to clearance from the liver. Lymphocyte proliferation assays suggest that the TLRs are not involved in the development of cell-mediated memory response to Brucella antigen. Antibody detection reveals that TLR2 and 4 are required to generate early antigen-specific IgG, but not during the late stages of infection. TLR2 and 4 are only transiently required for IgM production and not at all for IgA production. In contrast, MyD88 is essential for antigen specific IgG production late in infection, but is not required for IgM generation over the course of infection. Surprisingly, despite the prominent role for MyD88 in clearance from all tissues, MyD88-knockout mice express significantly higher levels of serum IgA. These results confirm the important role of MyD88 in controlling infection in the spleen while providing evidence of a prominent contribution to protection in other tissues. In addition, although TLR4 and TLR2 contribute little to control of spleen infection, a significant contribution to clearance of lung infection is described.","publish_time":"2012-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pei, Jianwu; Ding, Xicheng; Fan, Yaping; Rice-Ficht, Allison; Ficht, Thomas A.","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c3faeb0d5d8690917ef67e2f36bb59a93072c7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3435510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brucella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Brucella infection","spleen infection","clearance of lung infection","efficient clearance of Brucella","Brucella antigen","course of infection","late stages of infection","important role of MyD88","TLR2 requirement","MyD88-knockout mice","prominent contribution","development of adaptive immunity","liver","TLR4","significant contribution","demonstrable contribution","minor contribution","antigen specific IgG production","prominent role","IgA production","IgM production","development of cell","early antigen-specific IgG","TLRs","tissues","role of TLR","results","immune responses","IgM generation","mediated memory response","group of pattern recognition receptors","higher levels of serum IgA","brucellosis","PRRs","melitensis","humans","cause undulant fever","critical roles","evidence","previous reports","variety","host","protection","Th2","organs","lungs","aerosol exposure","Lymphocyte proliferation assays","contrast","animals","current report","Toll","Antibody detection","addition"],"language":"en"},

Challenges in the development of this approach are the relatively poor systemic AO delivery and inefficient dystrophin correction in affected non-skeletal muscle tissues, including the heart. We have previously reported impressive heart activity including high-splicing efficiency and dystrophin restoration following a single administration of an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPPs) conjugated to a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO): Pip5e-PMO. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are poorly understood. Here, we report studies involving single dose administration (12.5 mg/kg) of derivatives of Pip5e-PMO, consecutively assigned as Pip6-PMOs. These peptide-PMOs comprise alterations to the central hydrophobic core of the Pip5e peptide and illustrate that certain changes to the peptide sequence improves its activity; however, partial deletions within the hydrophobic core abolish its efficiency. Our data indicate that the hydrophobic core of the Pip sequences is critical for PMO delivery to the heart and that specific modifications to this region can enhance activity further.

RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210\u2013230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-\u03B2 promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect.

Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81\u2013105, 106\u2013130, 131\u2013155, 156\u2013180, 181\u2013205, 206\u2013230 or 231\u2013248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-\u03B2 suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","publish_time":"2012-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Head, Jennifer A.; Kalveram, Birte; Ikegami, Tetsuro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/604397da653890b54d4af23b45adab3365e1f042.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3446906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3446906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","RVFV"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["intact NSs","NSs protein","biological functions of RVFV NSs","co-expression of truncated NSs","NSs self-associates","attenuation of NSs function","conformational integrity of NSs","co-expression of nonfunctional NSs","NSs-mediated IFN-\u03B2 suppression","degradation of PKR","PKR degradation","lack functions of IFN","activation of IFN","significant dominant-negative functions","\u03B2 promoter","major virulence factor of RVFV","infected cells","dominant-negative effect","dominant-negative phenotype","\u03B2 mRNA synthesis inhibition","degradation of dsRNA","infected ruminants","presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain","dependent protein kinase","Sin3A-associated protein","cellular localization","nuclear localization","lethal hemorrhagic fever","Rift Valley fever virus","high rates of abortion","fetal malformation","stability","interferon","family Bunyaviridae","host transcription","neurological disorders","blindness","truncation of specific domains","SAP30","genus Phlebovirus","binds","priority pathogen","therapeutics available","RVF patients","humans","category","results","agent"],"language":"en"},

Recently recognized is the potential of comparative studies to identify functionally significant regulatory regions and to generate experimentally testable hypotheses that contribute to understanding mechanisms that regulate gene expression, including transcriptional activity, alternative splicing and transcript stability. Functional tests of hypotheses generated by computational approaches require experimentally tractable in vitro systems, including cell cultures.

How IAV balances the replication and transcription of its multiple genome segments is not understood. We developed a dual competition assay based on the co-transfection of firefly or Gaussia luciferase-encoding genome segments together with plasmids encoding IAV polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein. At limiting amounts of polymerase subunits, expression of the firefly luciferase segment was negatively affected by the presence of its Gaussia luciferase counterpart, indicative of competition between reporter genome segments. This competition could be relieved by increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of firefly or Gaussia reporter segment, respectively. The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that genome segments displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another segment. When natural genome segments were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter genome segments generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. The balance between different reporter segments was most dramatically affected by the introduction of UTR panhandle-stabilizing mutations. Furthermore, only reporter genome segments carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in infected cells. Our data indicate that IAV genome segments compete for available polymerases. Competition is affected by segment length, coding region, and UTRs. This competition is probably most apparent early during infection, when limiting amounts of polymerases are present, and may contribute to the regulation of segment-specific replication and transcription.","publish_time":"2012-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widjaja, Ivy; de Vries, Erik; Rottier, Peter J.

Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains \u003E5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.","publish_time":"2012-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aziz, Ramy K.; Devoid, Scott; Disz, Terrence; Edwards, Robert A.; Henry, Christopher S.; Olsen, Gary J.; Olson, Robert; Overbeek, Ross; Parrello, Bruce; Pusch, Gordon D.; Stevens, Rick L.; Vonstein, Veronika; Xia, Fangfang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce05a808109c6307485aeda93945cd3b0e536623.json; document_parses/pdf_json/15029a39f0a27d1bbccb6fed1793ea25700d9e57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3480482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEED Servers","RAST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SEED Servers","programmatic access","updated data","SEED database","open access","SEED code","SEED project","prokaryotic genome analysis","growing collection of metabolic models","high-performance remote access","hundreds of genome","scale metabolic models","integration of genomic data","rapid genome annotation","hundreds of existing metabolic models","Large integrations of genomic data","metabolic reconstructions","prokaryotic genomes","computational analysis tools","detailed models of metabolism","basic annotation services","flux balance analysis","ability","RAST annotation server","complete genomes","growing collection of encoded subsystems","major intellectual resources","network-based servers","synthetic biology","major bottleneck","remote locations","updated set of curated annotations","comprehensive resources","broad collection of potential users","deluge of published microbial genomes","underlying relational database","independent research efforts","derived set of protein families","biological knowledge","translation of sequence information","environmental microbiology","significant utility","biotechnology","modeling","capabilities","sequencing technology","groups","comparison","remarkable advance","current copies","pressing issue","interpretation","framework"],"language":"en"},

These cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs), innate immune receptors which govern tailored inflammatory gene expression patterns. Monocytes, which produce pro-inflammatory mediators, are readily recruited to the central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: This study explored the expression of receptors (CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4) on circulating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy elderly adults who we classified as either IQ memory-consistent (high-performing, HP) or IQ memory-discrepant (low-performing, LP). RESULTS: The expression of CD11b, TLR4 and TLR2 was increased in MDMs from the LP group when compared to HP cohort. MDMs from both groups responded robustly to treatment with the TLR4 activator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in terms of cytokine production. Significantly, MDMs from the LP group displayed hypersensitivity to LPS exposure. INTERPRETATION: Overall these findings define differential receptor expression and cytokine profiles that occur in MDMs derived from a cohort of IQ memory-discrepant individuals.

RTA, the replication and transcription activator of KSHV, can either directly bind to DNA or use cellular DNA binding factors including CBF1/CSL as DNA adaptors. In addition, the viral factors LANA1 and vIRF4 are known to bind to CBF1/CSL and modulate RTA activity. To analyze the contribution of CBF1/CSL to reactivation in human B cells, we have successfully infected DG75 and DG75 CBF1/CSL knock-out cell lines with recombinant KSHV.219 and selected for viral maintenance by selective medium. Both lines maintained the virus irrespective of their CBF1/CSL status. Viral reactivation could be initiated in both B cell lines but viral genome replication was attenuated in CBF1/CSL deficient lines, which also failed to produce detectable levels of infectious virus. Induction of immediate early, early and late viral genes was impaired in CBF1/CSL deficient cells at multiple stages of the reactivation process but could be restored to wild-type levels by reintroduction of CBF1/CSL. To identify additional viral RTA target genes, which are directly controlled by CBF1/CSL, we analyzed promoters of a selected subset of viral genes. We show that the induction of the late viral genes ORF29a and ORF65 by RTA is strongly enhanced by CBF1/CSL. Orthologs of ORF29a in other herpesviruses are part of the terminase complex required for viral packaging. ORF65 encodes the small capsid protein essential for capsid shell assembly. Our study demonstrates for the first time that in human B cells viral replication can be initiated in the absence of CBF1/CSL but the reactivation process is severely attenuated at all stages and does not lead to virion production. Thus, CBF1/CSL acts as a global hub which is used by the virus to coordinate the lytic cascade.","publish_time":"2013-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scholz, Barbara A.; Harth-Hertle, Marie L.; Malterer, Georg; Haas, Juergen; Ellwart, Joachim; Schulz, Thomas F.; Kempkes, Bettina","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74f36e3fdaac0583dace5a4a9031bc79d154c798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3656114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Orthologs"],"organizations":["RTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral reactivation","DG75 CBF1","reintroduction of CBF1","CSL knock","absence of CBF1","contribution of CBF1","CSL acts","CSL status","CSL deficient cells","viral maintenance","viral packaging","viral pathogenesis","CSL deficient lines","human B cells viral replication","viral genome replication","late viral genes ORF29a","viral factors LANA1","selected subset of viral genes","additional viral RTA target genes","B cell lines","reactivation process","RTA activity","ORF65","DNA adaptors","recombinant KSHV","cellular DNA binding factors","detectable levels of infectious virus","Induction of immediate early","transcription activator of KSHV","infected DG75","multiple stages","Orthologs of ORF29a","capsid shell assembly","wild-type levels","small capsid protein essential","persistent infection","critical compartment","time","promoters","herpesviruses","terminase complex","global hub","vIRF4","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma","selective medium","lytic cascade","virion production","study"],"language":"en"},

Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBV-induced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.","publish_time":"2013-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Nikki; Tierney, Rosemary; Wei, Wenbin; Vockerodt, Martina; Murray, Paul G.; Woodman, Ciaran B.; Rowe, Martin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e0504a1c581c36bbf2c2c97439b87b9834b108b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3664578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV blasts","EBV infection","EBV results","efficiency of EBV","EBV infected blasts","EBV-associated malignancy","B cell model","Infection of normal resting B cells","CD40L","original resting B cells","early following infection of B cells","induced B cell transformation","cell contexts","transformed cell lines","pathway genes","common set of genes","stimulated genes","growing lymphoblastoid cell lines","normal germinal center cell counterparts","micro-dissected malignant cells","common changes","set of interferon","Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma biopsies","transcriptional changes","lymphocyte activation","physiological stimulation","silico analyses","types of lymphoblasts","oncogenic virus","early events","global transcriptome analyses","discordant regulation of interferon","finite proliferation lifespans","Epstein-Barr virus","relevance","human lymphoid malignancies","maintenance","establishment","development","transcriptomes","pathogenesis","days culture","considerable overlap","data","important difference","subset"],"language":"en"},

We use evolutionary and functional analyses of TfR1 in the rodent clade, where two families of viruses bind this receptor, to mechanistically dissect how essential housekeeping genes like TFR1 successfully balance the opposing selective pressures exerted by host and virus. We find that while the sequence of rodent TfR1 is generally conserved, a small set of TfR1 residue positions has evolved rapidly over the speciation of rodents. Remarkably, all of these residues correspond to the two virus binding surfaces of TfR1. We show that naturally occurring mutations at these positions block virus entry while simultaneously preserving iron-uptake functionalities, both in rodent and human TfR1. Thus, by constantly replacing the amino acids encoded at just a few residue positions, TFR1 divorces adaptation to ever-changing viruses from preservation of key cellular functions. These dynamics have driven genetic divergence at the TFR1 locus that now enforces species-specific barriers to virus transmission, limiting both the cross-species and zoonotic transmission of these viruses.","publish_time":"2013-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demogines, Ann; Abraham, Jonathan; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael; Sawyer, Sara L.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dca48fcd1b8a28f470494d64ea3811707e28766b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/08ee65d70ad0dae18dd402eb531103c2dfbbeffb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3665890.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TFR1 locus","human TfR1","sequence of rodent TfR1","TFR1 divorces adaptation","functional analyses of TfR1","virus binding surfaces of TfR1","small set of TfR1 residue positions","virus transmission","ever-changing viruses","positions block virus entry","families of viruses","iron uptake","cellular entry of multiple mammalian viruses","rodent clade","Transferrin Receptor","iron-uptake functionalities","cell-surface receptor","zoonotic transmission","preservation of key cellular functions","process","cells","opposing selective pressures","species-specific barriers","cross-species","host","genetic divergence","mutations","essential housekeeping genes","amino acids","life","dynamics","residues","speciation of rodents"],"language":"en"},

The role of microRNA (miRNA) has recently been highlighted in pathogen-host interactions. However, the precise role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in humans, especially in critically ill patients is still unclear. METHODS: We identified cellular miRNAs involved in the host response to influenza virus infection by performing comprehensive miRNA profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from critically ill patients with swine-origin influenza pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus infection via miRNA microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of severe H1N1 influenza virus infection. Furthermore, an integrative network of miRNA-mediated host-influenza virus protein interactions was constructed by integrating the predicted and validated miRNA-gene interaction data with influenza virus and host-protein-protein interaction information using Cytoscape software. Moreover, several hub genes in the network were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Forty-one significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found by miRNA microarray; nine were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. QRT-PCR assay and ROC curve analyses revealed that miR-31, miR-29a and miR-148a all had significant potential diagnostic value for critically ill patients infected with H1N1 influenza virus, which yielded AUC of 0.9510, 0.8951 and 0.8811, respectively. We subsequently constructed an integrative network of miRNA-mediated host-influenza virus protein interactions, wherein we found that miRNAs are involved in regulating important pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, during influenza virus infection. Some of differentially expressed miRNAs via in silico analysis targeted mRNAs of several key genes in these pathways. The mRNA expression level of tumor protein T53 and transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 were found significantly reduced in critically ill patients, whereas the expression of Janus kinase 2, caspase 3 apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase, interleukin 10, and myxovirus resistance 1 were extremely increased in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the dysregulation of miRNAs in the PBMCs of H1N1 critically ill patients can regulate a number of key genes in the major signaling pathways associated with influenza virus infection. These differentially expressed miRNAs could be potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for severe influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2013-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Hao; Wang, Qi; Guo, Yang; Liu, Shunai; Song, Rui; Gao, Xuesong; Dai, Li; Li, Baoshun; Zhang, Deli; Cheng, Jun","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f1997f1d143697faaf7c1fc78684ae8a8b1d5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3679792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe influenza virus infection","pathogenesis of influenza virus infection","mediated host-influenza virus protein interactions","host-protein","diagnostic accuracy of severe H1N1 influenza virus infection","ill patients","miRNA microarray","swine-origin influenza pandemic H1N1","integrative network of miRNA","cellular miRNAs","dysregulation of miRNAs","pathogen-host interactions","precise role of miRNAs","protein interaction information","global host response","comprehensive miRNA profiling","PBMCs of H1N1","validated miRNA-gene interaction data","QRT-PCR assay","mitogen-activated protein kinase","curve analysis","ROC curve analyses","mRNA expression level of tumor protein T53","epidermal growth factor receptor","growth factor beta receptor","number of key genes","important pathways","hub genes","AUC","expression of Janus kinase","significant potential diagnostic value","role of microRNA","potential therapeutic targets","silico analysis targeted mRNAs","quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","caspase","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","biomarkers","interleukin","apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase","major","humans","economic consequences","area","Toll","disastrous health","Receiver operator characteristic","Cytoscape software","concerns","assays","myxovirus resistance","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Currently, it remains a frequent treatment in the intensive care unit, both for critically ill adults and children. However, observational studies have shown that plasma transfusion fail to correct mildly abnormal coagulation tests. Furthermore, recent epidemiological studies have shown that plasma transfusions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, plasma, as any other treatment, has to be used when the benefits outweigh the risks. Based on observational data, most experts suggest limiting its use either to massively bleeding patients or bleeding patients who have documented abnormal coagulation tests, and refraining for transfusing plasma to nonbleeding patients whatever their coagulation tests.

Various factors including heredity, environmental agent, innate and acquired immunity, and skin barrier function participate in the pathogenesis of AD. T -helper (Th) 2-dominant immunological milieu has been suggested in the acute phase of AD. Antigen 85B (Ag85B) is a 30-kDa secretory protein well conserved in Mycobacterium species. Ag85B has strong Th1-type cytokine inducing activity, and is expected to ameliorate Th2 condition in allergic disease. To perform Ag85B function in vivo, effective and less invasive vaccination method is required. Recently, we have established a novel functional virus vector; recombinant human parainfluenza type 2 virus vector (rhPIV2): highly expressive, replication-deficient, and very low-pathogenic vector. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of rhPIV2 engineered to express Ag85B (rhPIV2/Ag85B) in a mouse AD model induced by repeated oxazolone (OX) challenge. Ear swelling, dermal cell infiltrations and serum IgE level were significantly suppressed in the rhPIV2/Ag85B treated mouse group accompanied with elevated IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10 mRNA expressions, and suppressed IL-4, TNF-\u03B1 and MIP-2 mRNA expressions. The treated mice showed no clinical symptom of croup or systemic adverse reactions. The respiratory tract epithelium captured rhPIV2 effectively without remarkable cytotoxic effects. These results suggested that rhPIV2/Ag85B might be a potent therapeutic tool to control allergic disorders.","publish_time":"2013-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kitagawa, Hiroshi; Kawano, Mitsuo; Yamanaka, Keiichi; Kakeda, Masato; Tsuda, Kenshiro; Inada, Hiroyasu; Yoneda, Misao; Sakaguchi, Tadashi; Nigi, Akina; Nishimura, Koumei; Komada, Hiroshi; Tsurudome, Masato; Yasutomi, Yasuhiro; Nosaka, Tetsuya; Mizutani, Hitoshi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3380c2147c090bd81525c67d4200fb3860517008.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3701015.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ag85B function","efficacy of rhPIV2","mRNA expressions","allergic disease","suppressed IL","novel functional virus vector","mouse AD model","low-pathogenic vector","skin barrier function","mouse group","recurrent inflammatory skin disease","allergic disorders","treated mice","recombinant human parainfluenza type","strong Th1-type cytokine","clinical symptom of croup","dermal cell infiltrations","repeated oxazolone","elevated IFN-\u03B3","serum IgE level","potent therapeutic tool","environmental agent","pathogenesis of","immunity","systemic adverse reactions","TNF-\u03B1","Various factors","heredity","kDa secretory protein","activity","replication-deficient","MIP","respiratory tract epithelium","remarkable cytotoxic effects","Antigen","dominant immunological milieu","Mycobacterium species","acute phase of","T -helper","invasive vaccination method","challenge","Ear","Th2 condition","Atopic dermatitis","results","study"],"language":"en"},

It has been demonstrated previously that HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is involved in cell transformation. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was conducted to identify cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Cytosolic 5\u2032(3\u2032)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) was found to interact with HCV NS3 protein. Binding domains of HCV NS3 and cellular cdN proteins were also determined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions between HCV NS3 and cdN proteins were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis in cultured cells. The cellular cdN activity was partially repressed by NS3 protein in both the transiently-transfected and the stably-transfected systems. Furthermore, HCV partially repressed the cdN activity while had no effect on its protein expression in the systems of HCV sub-genomic replicons and infectious HCV virions. Deoxyribonucleotidases are present in most mammalian cells and involve in the regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools by substrate cycles. Control of DNA precursor concentration is essential for the maintenance of genetic stability. Reduction of cdN activity would result in the imbalance of DNA precursor concentrations. Thus, our results suggested that HCV partially reduced the cdN activity via its NS3 protein and this may in turn cause diseases.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Chiu-Ping; Li, Zhi-Cheng; Yang, Chee-Hing; Cheng, Ju-Chien; Yeh, Yung-Ju; Sun, Tsai-Hsia; Li, Hui-Chun; Juang, Yue-Li; Lo, Shih-Yen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c7ae8ea3cf737fe457b191ae7a7dc2fcaee44bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3706368.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3706368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","Cytosolic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV NS3 protein","HCV non-structural protein","Binding domains of HCV NS3","cellular cdN activity","cellular cdN proteins","infectious HCV virions","Reduction of cdN activity","protein expression","cellular proteins","systems of HCV sub-genomic replicons","yeast","transfected systems","cultured cells","mammalian cells","Control of DNA precursor concentration","imbalance of DNA precursor concentrations","hybrid system","cell transformation","B-cell lymphomas","hybrid screening experiment","hepatocellular carcinoma","co-immunoprecipitation","regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools","confocal analysis","substrate cycles","liver cirrhosis","Infection","hepatitis C virus","effect","maintenance of genetic stability","Interactions","Deoxyribonucleotidases","turn cause diseases","study","dNT","results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report for the first time, a method in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris that enables simultaneous surface display and secretion of full-length mAb molecules with human-like N-glycans using the same yeast cell. This paradigm takes advantage of homo-dimerization of the Fc portion of an IgG molecule to a surface-anchored \u0022bait\u0022 Fc, which results in targeting functional \u201Chalf\u201D IgGs to the cell wall of Pichia pastoris without interfering with the secretion of full length mAb.

However, the mechanism of severe encephalitis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using a mouse model, we investigated the pathogenetic mechanisms that correlate with fatal JEV infection. Following extraneural infection with the JaOArS982 strain of JEV, infected mice exhibited clinical signs ranging from mild to fatal outcome. Comparison of the pathogenetic response between severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice revealed increased levels of TNF-\u03B1 in the brains of severe cases. However, unexpectedly, the mortality rate of TNF-\u03B1 KO mice was significantly increased compared with that of WT mice, indicating that TNF-\u03B1 plays a protective role against fatal infection. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-\u03B1 KO mice. However, exaggerated inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-\u03B1 KO mice. Although these observations were also obtained in IL-10 KO mice, the mortality and enhanced inflammatory responses were more pronounced in TNF-\u03B1 KO mice. Our findings therefore provide the first evidence that TNF-\u03B1 has an immunoregulatory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS during JEV infection and consequently protects the animals from fatal disease. Thus, we propose that the increased level of TNF-\u03B1 in severe cases was the result of severe disease, and secondly that immunopathological effects contribute to severe neuronal degeneration resulting in fatal disease. In future, further elucidation of the immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF-\u03B1 will be an important priority to enable the development of effective treatment strategies for Japanese encephalitis.","publish_time":"2013-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayasaka, Daisuke; Shirai, Kenji; Aoki, Kotaro; Nagata, Noriyo; Simantini, Dash Sima; Kitaura, Kazutaka; Takamatsu, Yuki; Gould, Ernest; Suzuki, Ryuji; Morita, Kouichi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77c5a33cacec66e3eecf748902a04cd245df6e0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3733918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF-\u03B1 KO mice","CNS of TNF","infected mice","WT mice","fatal disease","fatal infection","immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF","increased levels of TNF","increased level of TNF","fatal JEV infection","mortality rate of TNF","mechanism of severe encephalitis","result of severe disease","brains of severe cases","fatal outcome","severe neuronal degeneration","inflammatory responses","extraneural infection","JaOArS982 strain of JEV","mild cases of JaOArS982","Japanese encephalitis virus","pro-inflammatory cytokines","clinical signs","immunoregulatory effect","clinical symptoms","pathogenetic response","pathogenetic mechanisms","acute central nervous system","development of effective treatment strategies","immunopathological effects","febrile illness","humans","protective role","significant differences of viral load","meningitis","important priority","elucidation","animals","mouse model","Comparison","evidence","study","future","observations","findings"],"language":"en"},

Objective: We examined possible approaches and sought to identify research needs to enable human health risk assessments (HHRA) that focus on the role of the environment in the failure of antibiotic treatment caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Methods: The authors participated in a workshop held 4\u20138 March 2012 in Qu\u00E9bec, Canada, to define the scope and objectives of an environmental assessment of antibiotic-resistance risks to human health. We focused on key elements of environmental-resistance-development \u201Chot spots,\u201D exposure assessment (unrelated to food), and dose response to characterize risks that may improve antibiotic-resistance management options. Discussion: Various novel aspects to traditional risk assessments were identified to enable an assessment of environmental antibiotic resistance. These include a) accounting for an added selective pressure on the environmental resistome that, over time, allows for development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB); b) identifying and describing rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the relevant environmental \u201Chot spot\u201D compartments; and c) modifying traditional dose\u2013response approaches to address doses of ARB for various health outcomes and pathways. Conclusions: We propose that environmental aspects of antibiotic-resistance development be included in the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. Because of limited available data, a multicriteria decision analysis approach would be a useful way to undertake an HHRA of environmental antibiotic resistance that informs risk managers.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the distribution of FCV and FHV-1 among the feline population of several counties in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. To this end, conjunctival and nasal swabs were collected from 302 cats from different locations, including households, breeding catteries, veterinary clinics, animal hospitals and experimental research facilities. The samples were collected between July 2006 to June 2009. The virus isolation was performed in CRFK cells and, subsequently, the identification was confirmed by PCR. FCV, FHV-1, or both were isolated from 55 cats from 28 different locations. FCV alone was isolated from 52.7% (29/55) of the animals that tested positively, FHV-1 alone was isolated from 38.2% (21/55) of the animals that tested positively, and co-infection were detected in 9.1% (5/55) of the animals that tested positively. Virus detection was more prevalent in cats that were less than 1 year old, among animals that shared a living space with other cats, and females. FCV and FHV-1 were isolated from vaccinated cats. In addition, both viruses were isolated from cats that showed no signs of disease. The results suggest that a carrier state is common for both viruses in the evaluated population. A search for other causes of respiratory disease in that population is necessary; and further studies relating to the molecular characterization of viruses and vaccine efficacy are also necessary.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henzel, Andr\u00E9ia; Brum, M\u00E1rio Celso Sperotto; Lautert, Cl\u00E1udia; Martins, Mathias; Lovato, Luciane Teresinha; Weiblen, Rudi","journal":"Braz J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b2c74eaf9dc747307ec2d91ba16771cd505e44c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3768834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV","PCR"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["FHV","vaccinated cats","animals","feline population","distribution of FCV","causes of respiratory disease","Feline calicivirus","evaluated population","signs of disease","different locations","primary causes of upper respiratory tract disease","molecular characterization of viruses","feline herpesvirus type","Sul State","carrier state","virus isolation","Virus detection","animal hospitals","veterinary clinics","breeding catteries","households","Rio Grande","counties","experimental research facilities","vaccine efficacy","Brazil","nasal swabs","studies","CRFK cells","living space","end","year old","study","identification","results","females","co-infection","aim","PCR","addition","samples"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The German and Austrian AIDS societies developed these guidelines between March 2010 and November 2011. A structured Medline research was performed for 12 diseases, namely Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus manifestations, candidiasis, herpes simplex virus infections, varizella zoster virus infections, progressive multifocal leucencephalopathy, cryptosporidiosis, cryptococcosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria infections and tuberculosis. Due to the lack of evidence by randomized controlled trials, part of the guidelines reflects expert opinions. The German version was accepted by the German and Austrian AIDS Societies and was previously published by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften (AWMF; German Association of the Scientific Medical Societies). CONCLUSION: The review presented here is a translation of a short version of the German\u2013Austrian Guidelines of opportunistic infections in HIV patients. These guidelines are well-accepted in a clinical setting in both Germany and Austria. They lead to a similar treatment of a heterogeneous group of patients in these countries.","publish_time":"2013-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thoden, J.; Potthoff, A.; Bogner, J. R.; Brockmeyer, N.

Despite this, the basis for the disease progression is incompletely understood. To investigate the effect of co-infection on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) we analysed the expression of clinically important pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines. IAV infection or treatment with supernatants from IAV-infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the DCs which subsequently influenced the production of IL-12p70, as well as IL-6, following SP infection. Co-infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time, dose and duration of the infections, as well as pathogen viability, bacterial uptake and endosome acidification. Bacterially infected cells were characterized as the main producers of IL-12p70. Finally, we showed that type I interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of IL-12p70 that was observed by infection with IAV. These results provide a probable mechanism for the elevated levels of particular cytokines observed in IAV and SP co-infected cell cultures with implications for the pathogenic outcome observed during in vivo infection.","publish_time":"2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuri, Thomas; Smed S\u00F6rensen, Anna; Thomas, Saskia; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Normark, Staffan; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; McInerney, Gerald M; Plant, Laura","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3798092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","SP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV infection","SP infection","effect of co-infection","IAV-infected cell cultures","priming of IL","12p70","SP co-infected cell cultures","infected cells","production of IL","main producers of IL","Secondary infections","immune-modulatory cytokines","elevated levels of particular cytokines","human monocyte-derived dendritic cells","implications","supernatants","pathogen viability","bacterial uptake","MDDCs","treatment","probable mechanism","endosome acidification","substantial impact","pathogenic outcome","expression","dose","time","Streptococcus pneumoniae","influenza","global health","interferons","duration","virus","basis","disease progression","type","results"],"language":"en"},

However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele \u201CA\u201D in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: DC-SIGN can potentially complement the role of Fc\u03B3RIIB in the anti-inflammatory cascade involved in the IVIG response mechanism.","publish_time":"2013-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Portman, Michael A; Wiener, Howard W; Silva, Miriam; Shendre, Aditi; Shrestha, Sadeep","journal":"Pediatr Rheumatol Online J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c3f5dde0537e3072d046990501a4e71471d9ddc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3847673.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IVIG","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IVIG-R","DC-SIGN promoter","human DC-SIGN","anti-inflammatory action of IVIG","pathway of IVIG response","SIGN-R1","IVIG response mechanism","influence IVIG refractoriness","IVIG non-responder","minor allele","major allele","anti-inflammatory responses","anti-inflammatory cascade","allele frequency distributions","Genetic variants","KD patients","ethnic groups","inhibiting Fc\u03B3RIIB","role of Fc\u03B3RIIB","Hispanic populations","component responsible","SNPs","Kawasaki Disease","related molecule","single nucleotide polymorphisms","sialylated Fc","known receptor","differential distribution","Distinct differences","genes","mice","case-control approach","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","rs2287886","association","Asians","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded relationship outcomes that are consistent with the known virus classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conform to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, the RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA stage displayed a remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48 respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: The study of genomic word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The congruence of the relationship outcomes with the known classification indicates that there exist phylogenetic signals in the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, that is most prominent in the replicase open reading frames.","publish_time":"2003-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yap, Yee Leng; Zhang, Xue Wu; Danchin, Antoine","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59ffca26c9d1f881e4e37e7c5af626d72d858dc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC222961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC222961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","UpA","CpA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns","overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns","tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V","genome of RNA viruses","relationship outcomes","selected viruses","study of genomic word usage","specific pattern of word usage","SARS-CoV","genomic sequence relationship of SARS","relationship tree","known virus classification","viruses of various families","known classification","non-standard approaches","different single-stranded RNA","Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus","vector V","correlation coefficient","open question","replicase open reading frames","ssRNA","cause","powerful method","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","remarkable discrimination","TGV","UpA","phylogenetic signals","Feline CoronaVirus","vectorial profiling","FCoV","distance measure","CpG","family","exact origin","multivariate factor analysis","DNA stage","selection","UpG","CpA","neighbor","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Potential factors","biases","BACKGROUND","algorithm","congruence"],"language":"en"},

In humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted. RESULTS: We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species. Enzymes with sequences sharing over 80% identity have been found in the genomes of macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. Closely related, although clearly distinct, enzymes are present in fish (fugu and zebra), as well as in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis). A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the homology with Pseudomonas sp. 101 sedolisin. CONCLUSION: CLN2 is very highly conserved and widely distributed among higher organisms and may play an important role in their life cycles. The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible active site that is almost completely conserved among all known CLN2 enzymes. This result is somehow surprising for a tripeptidase where the presence of a more constrained binding pocket was anticipated. This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these enzymes and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2.","publish_time":"2003-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wlodawer, Alexander; Durell, Stewart R; Li, Mi; Oyama, Hiroshi; Oda, Kohei; Dunn, Ben M","journal":"BMC Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dab2d95da5307c840eb4a1e00f0186022541d63d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC280685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC280685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["known CLN2 enzymes","three-dimensional model of human CLN2","Similar enzymes","specific inhibitors of CLN2","genomic sequences","structural model","presence of orthologs","number of eukaryotic species","fatal neurodegenerative disease","classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis","enzyme lead","fish","important role","family of sedolisins","dog","genomes of macaque","mouse","defects","expression","search","fugu","design","serine-carboxyl peptidases","higher organisms","physiological substrates","distribution","accessible active site","homology","Pseudomonas","life cycles","zebra","tripeptidase","systematic analyses","constrained binding pocket","member","Tripeptidyl-peptidase","frogs","Xenopus tropicalis","structures","BACKGROUND","humans","cow","identity","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Specific mechanisms recruiting neutrophils to the lung during virus-induced lung inflammation and injury have not been fully elucidated. Since CXCL1 and CXCL2/3, acting through CXCR2, are potent neutrophil chemoattractants, we investigated their role in dsRNA-induced lung injury, where dsRNA (Poly IC) is a well-described synthetic agent mimicking acute viral infection. METHODS: We used 6\u20138 week old female BALB/c mice to intratracheally inject either single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the airways. The lungs were then harvested at designated timepoints to characterize the elicited chemokine response and resultant lung injury following dsRNA exposure as demonstrated qualititatively by histopathologic analysis, and quantitatively by FACS, protein, and mRNA analysis of BAL fluid and tissue samples. We then repeated the experiments by first pretreating mice with an anti-PMN or corresponding control antibody, and then subsequently pretreating a separate cohort of mice with an anti-CXCR2 or corresponding control antibody prior to dsRNA exposure. RESULTS: Intratracheal dsRNA led to significant increases in neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in BALB/c mice at 72 h following dsRNA, but not in response to ssRNA (Poly C; control) treatment. Expression of CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 paralleled neutrophil recruitment to the lung. Neutrophil depletion studies significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in response to dsRNA when mice were pretreated with an anti-PMN monoclonal Ab. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 interaction by pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice with an anti-CXCR2 neutralizing Ab also significantly attenuated neutrophil sequestration and lung injury. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that CXC chemokine ligand/CXCR2 biological axis is critical during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury relevant to acute viral infections.","publish_time":"2005-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Londhe, Vedang A; Belperio, John A; Keane, Michael P; Burdick, Marie D; Xue, Ying Ying; Strieter, Robert M","journal":"J Inflamm (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77aae7c898acfb4ff723de2af7928a38b169878a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1156932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1156932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzExNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS","BAL","CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dsRNA-induced lung injury","resultant lung injury","sustained lung injury","anti-CXCR2","induced lung injury relevant","dsRNA exposure","pathogenesis of dsRNA","Intratracheal dsRNA","pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice","chronic lung disease","CXCR2 interaction","c mice","neutrophil infiltration","pretreating mice","virus-induced lung inflammation","CXCR2 paralleled neutrophil recruitment","inhibition of CXCR2 ligands","Expression of CXCR2 ligands","neutrophil sequestration","CXCR2 biological axis","Neutrophil depletion studies","separate cohort of mice","potent neutrophil chemoattractants","Poly C","acute viral infections","anti-PMN monoclonal","corresponding control antibody","elicited chemokine response","infiltration of leukocytes","Respiratory viral infections","ssRNA","Poly IC","histopathologic analysis","activated neutrophils","CXC chemokine ligand","double-stranded RNA","mRNA analysis of BAL fluid","week old female BALB","well-described synthetic agent","significant increases","role","FACS","Ab","tissue samples","designated timepoints","protein","findings","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Specific mechanisms","treatment","lungs","CONCLUSION","CXCL2","airways","experiments","CXCL1","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Often orthologs of functional receptors are present in a wide range of species, but amino acid differences can render these receptors non-functional. In some cases amino acid differences result in additional N-linked glycosylation that blocks virus infection. The latter block to retrovirus infection can be overcome by treatment of cells with compounds such as tunicamycin, which prevent the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides. RESULTS: We have discovered that treatment of cells with liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine (PS) can also overcome the block to infection mediated by N-linked glycosylation. Importantly, this effect occurs without apparent change in the glycosylation state of the receptors for these viruses. This effect occurs with delayed kinetics compared to previous results showing enhancement of virus infection by PS treatment of cells expressing functional virus receptors. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that PS treatment can relieve the block to retrovirus infection of cells expressing retroviral receptors that have been rendered non-functional by glycosylation. These findings have important implications for the current model describing inhibition of virus entry by receptor glycosylation.","publish_time":"2005-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coil, David A; Miller, A Dusty","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0450e1d435d63e69e1867c2eba65c0c08af70038.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1201173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1201173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functional virus receptors","retrovirus infection of cells","receptors non-functional","enhancement of virus infection","PS treatment of cells","retroviral receptors","orthologs of functional receptors","additional N-linked glycosylation","glycosylation state","receptor glycosylation","block","inhibition of virus entry","absence of appropriate cell-surface receptors","addition of N","linked oligosaccharides","effect","cases amino acid differences","major determinant of retrovirus host range","previous results","wide range of species","current model","presence","important implications","delayed kinetics","apparent change","liposomes","findings","BACKGROUND","tunicamycin","phosphatidylserine","compounds","viruses","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We and others identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by using S fragments of various lengths but all including the amino acid residue 318 and two other potential glycosylation sites. To further characterize the role of glycosylation and identify residues important for its function as an interacting partner of ACE2, we have cloned, expressed and characterized various soluble fragments of S containing RBD, and mutated all potential glycosylation sites and 32 other residues. The shortest of these fragments still able to bind the receptor ACE2 did not include residue 318 (which is a potential glycosylation site), but started at residue 319, and has only two potential glycosylation sites (residues 330 and 357). Mutation of each of these sites to either alanine or glutamine, as well as mutation of residue 318 to alanine in longer fragments resulted in the same decrease of molecular weight (by approximately 3 kDa) suggesting that all glycosylation sites are functional. Simultaneous mutation of all glycosylation sites resulted in lack of expression suggesting that at least one glycosylation site (any of the three) is required for expression. Glycosylation did not affect binding to ACE2. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the fragment S319\u2013518 resulted in the identification of ten residues (K390, R426, D429, T431, I455, N473, F483, Q492, Y494, R495) that significantly reduced binding to ACE2, and one residue (D393) that appears to increase binding. Mutation of residue T431 reduced binding by about 2-fold, and mutation of the other eight residues \u2013 by more than 10-fold. Analysis of these data and the mapping of these mutations on the recently determined crystal structure of a fragment containing the RBD complexed to ACE2 (Li, F, Li, W, Farzan, M, and Harrison, S. C., submitted) suggested the existence of two hot spots on the S RBD surface, R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute significant portion of the binding energy. The finding that most of the mutations (23 out of 34 including glycosylation sites) do not affect the RBD binding function indicates possible mechanisms for evasion of immune responses.","publish_time":"2005-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakraborti, Samitabh; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Xiao, Xiaodong; Dimitrov, Dimiter S","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd02864e1ab4b40712401ac5a0c8580dc98c0c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1236967.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1236967/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Harrison","S.

The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix\u2014a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies\u2014for this purpose.","publish_time":"2005-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnett, Daniel J.; Balicer, Ran D.; Blodgett, David; Fews, Ayanna L.; Parker, Cindy L.; Links, Jonathan M.","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1c6a98c21304f3788b20870b34afd8a115fa38c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1257548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["State"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["response activities","public health preparedness","comparable public health readiness","response strategies","response capabilities","response hurdles","response needs","public\u2019s health","local health departments","all-hazards response model","local health department level","emergency readiness","recent natural disasters","specific preparedness","fundamental paradigm","conceptual model","injury prevention","intentional attacks","additional models","complex family of situation","powerful improvements","federal government","tools","decades","Haddon matrix","efficiency","efficacy","human","practice","unprecedented challenges","view","framework","Adoption","time","ensuing anthrax mailings","State","use","accidents","threats","purpose","solutions","illness"],"language":"en"},

Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules \u2013 including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors \u2013 that viruses co-opt for cell entry.

First reported in Asia, SARS quickly spread worldwide through international travelling. As of July 2003, the World Health Organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score. CONCLUSION: The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease.","publish_time":"2005-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yun-Shien; Chen, Chun-Houh; Chao, Angel; Chen, En-Shih; Wei, Min-Li; Chen, Lung-Kun; Yang, Kuender D; Lin, Meng-Chih; Wang, Yi-Hsi; Liu, Jien-Wei; Eng, Hock-Liew; Chiang, Ping-Cherng; Wu, Ting-Shu; Tsao, Kuo-Chein; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tien, Yin-Jing; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Wang, Hsing-Shih; Lee, Ying-Shiung","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79da8c8e26960026682cb2daf09ec3357b1bec5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1262710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","acute SARS patients","attack of SARS","rank of SARS severity","severity of recovering SARS patients","non-SARS controls","SARS-infected blood","severity rank","expression profiles","signature genes","gene expression of peripheral blood","severity of respiratory distress","regulated genes","genome-wide gene expression","general suppression of gene expression","global expression profile","smooth transition pattern of severity","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","normal controls","host changes","GAP approach","eosinophil-derived neurotoxin","recent epidemic human disease","defensins","total","associate plots","days","complexity","BACKGROUND","clinical pulmonary infection score","innate immunity","World Health Organization","continuity of biological systems","novel coronavirus","use","people","recovery period","CONCLUSION","pathophysiology","clustering methods","immunopathological damages","RESULTS","international travelling","mortality rate","Asia"],"language":"en"},

Biosensors, being hybrid devices composed by a biological receptor and a signal transducer, represent valuable alternatives to non biological analytical instruments because of the high specificity of the biomolecular recognition. The vast range of existing protein ligands enable those macromolecules to be used as efficient receptors to cover a diversity of applications. In addition, appropriate protein engineering approaches enable further improvement of the receptor functioning such as enhancing affinity or specificity in the ligand binding. Recently, several protein-only sensors are being developed, in which either both the receptor and signal transducer are parts of the same protein, or that use the whole cell where the protein is produced as transducer. In both cases, as no further chemical coupling is required, the production process is very convenient. However, protein platforms, being rather rigid, restrict the proper signal transduction that necessarily occurs through ligand-induced conformational changes. In this context, insertional protein engineering offers the possibility to develop new devices, efficiently responding to ligand interaction by dramatic conformational changes, in which the specificity and magnitude of the sensing response can be adjusted up to a convenient level for specific analyte species. In this report we will discuss the major engineering approaches taken for the designing of such instruments as well as the relevant examples of resulting protein-only biosensors.","publish_time":"2006-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferraz, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Vera, Andrea; Ar\u00EDs, Anna; Villaverde, Antonio","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8d81518d127913ce42b22fbdd96d416c4f82e44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1459189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1459189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein platforms","insertional protein engineering","appropriate protein engineering approaches","signal transducer","relevant examples of resulting protein","biological receptor","vast range of existing protein ligands","high specificity","major engineering approaches","ligand interaction","ligand binding","receptor functioning","Biosensors","biological analytical instruments","proper signal transduction","dramatic conformational changes","new devices","hybrid devices","convenient level","specific analyte species","quantitative detection of low analyte concentrations","complex samples","valuable alternatives","improvement","urgent need","food","macromolecules","affinity","possibility","designing","addition","parts","chemical coupling","efficient receptors","environmental fields","production process","magnitude","sensing response","biomolecular recognition","context","diversity of applications","cases","report","cell"],"language":"en"},

Since IFN response represents an early host defense event against viral infection and the fact that treatment with meliacine, a plant antiviral, ameliorate the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2, we wanted to investigate whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response. For this purpose we studied the effect of the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), which is the responsible for meliacine antiviral action, on the HSV-2 inhibition exerted by IFN \u03B1, IFN-\u03B3 or their combination. RESULTS: We have found that like HSV-1, IFN-\u03B3 synergizes with IFN-\u03B1 to inhibit HSV-2 replication in Vero cells. While treatment with IFN-\u03B1 or IFN-\u03B3 alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer. Moreover, the presence of CDM for 2 h before IFN induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period, reduces virus yields in an additive way without affecting IFN antiviral action. CONCLUSION: The results reported here indicated that the presence of CDM did not alter the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3 or the synergism exerted by their combination. As a result we can envision that the administration of CDM in vivo could not affect the biological activity of IFNs, which are so important mediators of the innate resistance to HSV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2006-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrera, Erina; Coto, Celia E","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fafa45b4080e37b2d37450168738d991a0399343.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1525181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1525181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","CDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B1","IFN \u03B1","IFN induction","IFN response","IFN antiviral action","antiviral activity of IFN","complete IFN treatment period","CDM treatment","strong inhibition of HSV","meliacine antiviral action","viral infection","administration of CDM","presence of CDM","viral replication","weak antiviral action","plant antiviral","herpetic infection","Vero cells","administration of meliacine","interferon combination","h induction period","virus cytopathic effect","infected mice","RESULTS","homoestasis of IFNs host response","onset of viral CPE","biological activity of IFNs","herpes simplex virus type","female mice","gamma interferon","early host defense event","plaque formation","severity","innate resistance","fact","additive way","important mediators","Recent studies","cinnamoyl","titer","synergism","BACKGROUND","compound","dihydroxymeliacarpin","addition","CONCLUSION","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNF\u03B1. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 expression by human epithelial BEAS-2B cells depended on activation of JNK and recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun to the il8 promoter.","publish_time":"2006-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmeck, Bernd; Moog, Kerstin; Zahlten, Janine; van Laak, Vincent; N\u0027Guessan, Philippe Dje; Opitz, Bastian; Rosseau, Simone; Suttorp, Norbert; Hippenstiel, Stefan","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/104a23fead757f1b8272ae0813db98b413375ae0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1533820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1533820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumococci-induced IL","pneumoniae-induced IL","release of IL","JNK-phosphorylation","JNK phosphorylation","pneumococci infection","human epithelial BEAS","epithelial HEK293 cells","B cells","activation of JNK","Inhibition of JNK","pneumoniae infection","Human bronchial epithelial cells","recruitment of phosphorylated c","JNK-phosphorylated activator protein","pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release","human lung epithelial cell line BEAS","pneumococci-lung cell interaction","phosphorylated subunit c","pneumoniae time","pneumoniae R6x","induced DNA binding of AP","release of distinct CC","endogenous il8 promoter","TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells","small molecule inhibitor SP600125","chromatin immunoprecipitation","mRNA expression","cytokine induction","Bioplex assay","Recruitment of Ser","electrophoretic mobility shift assay","growth factors","EMSA","transfection","AP1","METHODS","inhibitory effect","Fra2","Th2 cytokines","RNA polymerase","Th1","RT-PCR","subunits Fra1","terminal kinase","common causes of death","ELISA","infectious diseases","CXC","hypothesis","Fos","dominant negative mutant","Western blot","ChIP","maximum","repressor","regulator","CONCLUSION","pneumococcal pneumonia","Antisense-constructs","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","TNF\u03B1"],"language":"en"},

Some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region. METHODS: We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs. RESULTS: During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and 2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.","publish_time":"2006-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Podin, Yuwana; Gias, Edna LM; Ong, Flora; Leong, Yee-Wei; Yee, Siew-Fung; Yusof, Mohd Apandi; Perera, David; Teo, Bibiana; Wee, Thian-Yew; Yao, Sik-Chi; Yao, Sik-King; Kiyu, Andrew; Arif, Mohd Taha; Cardosa, Mary Jane","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1543637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1543637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Coxsackievirus"],"locations":["Asia Pacific","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of human enterovirus","epidemiology of human enterovirus","series of outbreaks","major outbreak of human enterovirus","mouth disease","foot","period Sarawak","burden of disease","years","throat swabs","associated hand","predominant strains","Asia Pacific region","Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated","transmission","order","sentinel surveillance programme","cyclical pattern","public health personnel","genotyping","interventions","Knowledge","effective manner","high numbers of fatalities","efficient way","virological information","fear","cases","BACKGROUND","beginning","Malaysia","isolate","sample","Virus isolation","METHODS","CONCLUSION","genogroup B","anxiety","RESULTS","vesicles","observations"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the role of airline travel in large-scale influenza spread is especially important given the mounting threat of an influenza pandemic. Several recent simulation studies have concluded that air travel restrictions may not have a significant impact on the course of a pandemic. Here, we assess, with empirical data, the role of airline volume on the yearly inter-regional spread of influenza in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We measured rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the United States for nine seasons, from 1996 to 2005 using weekly influenza and pneumonia mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonality was characterized by band-pass filtering. We found that domestic airline travel volume in November (mostly surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday) predicts the rate of influenza spread (r (2) = 0.60; p = 0.014). We also found that international airline travel influences the timing of influenza mortality (r (2) = 0.59; p = 0.016). The flight ban in the US after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent depression of the air travel market, provided a natural experiment for the evaluation of flight restrictions; the decrease in air travel was associated with a delayed and prolonged influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first empirical evidence for the role of airline travel in long-range dissemination of influenza. Our results suggest an important influence of international air travel on the timing of influenza introduction, as well as an influence of domestic air travel on the rate of inter-regional influenza spread in the US. Pandemic preparedness strategies should account for a possible benefit of airline travel restrictions on influenza spread.","publish_time":"2006-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brownstein, John S; Wolfe, Cecily J; Mandl, Kenneth D","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/381f1d10b47e89d45a1008b53292c66c034b6960.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1564183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","rate of influenza spread","large-scale influenza spread","weekly influenza","air travel restrictions","role of airline travel","influence of air travel","international airline travel","air travel market","timing of influenza mortality","timing of influenza introduction","rate of inter-regional influenza","influence of domestic air travel","yearly inter-regional spread of influenza","domestic airline travel volume","long-range dissemination of influenza","prolonged influenza season","important influence of international air travel","possible benefit of airline travel restrictions","rate of inter-regional spread","role of airline volume","evaluation of flight restrictions","United States","little empirical evidence","empirical data","Pandemic preparedness strategies","pneumonia mortality","flight ban","recent simulation studies","Centers","natural experiment","decrease","Disease Control","mounting threat","subject of numerous investigations","significant impact","subsequent depression","Prevention","course","FINDINGS","results","BACKGROUND","terrorist attack","Thanksgiving holiday","Seasonality","band-pass filtering","METHODS","seasons","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Its purpose is to study in-silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases, both known and theoretical, by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others. To understand the system fully, this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results. EpiFlex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza A epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling. EpiFlex is an object-oriented Monte Carlo system, allocating entities to correspond to individuals, disease vectors, diseases, and the locations that hosts may inhabit. EpiFlex defines eight different contact types available for a disease. Contacts occur inside locations within the model. Populations are composed of demographic groups, each of which has a cycle of movement between locations. Within locations, superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions. RESULTS: EpiFlex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health: (1) R(0 )is variable, and the smaller the population, the larger the infected fraction within that population will be; (2) significant compression/synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase; (3) if better true morbidity data were available, more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza. These results suggest that field research to study such phenomena, while expensive, should be worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Since EpiFlex shows all stages of disease progression, detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible. EpiFlex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data, but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system. EpiFlex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response.","publish_time":"2006-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanley, Brian","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d9a0fe39f4e845c44a06787de6f5f033b998a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1570461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EpiFlex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EpiFlex","results","locations","disease vectors","study","computer model","constructed model of disease dynamics","stages of disease progression","variety of field data sources","wide variety of diseases","types of modeling","phenomena","modeling influenza","stochastic system","different contact types available","better understanding of infectious diseases","true morbidity data","random variation characteristic of real world data","characteristic multimodality","epidemic behavior","progress of epidemics","object-oriented Monte Carlo system","single computer","level of individuals","field research","contact distributions","asymptomatic hosts","multi-city epidemic","major manifestation phase","early incubation phase","detailed insight","entities","strategies","synchronization","cities","silico","infected fraction","significant compression","public health","conjunction","emergent property","response","software","Populations","demographic groups","factor","paper","cycle of movement","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","superspreading","Contacts","user","expert","purpose","case"],"language":"en"},

This is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs. In this paper, we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays. The algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match. Taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified. Although developed using a resequencing microarray, the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information. The success and continued development of this approach means that a non-expert can now perform unassisted analysis of the results obtained from partial sequence data.","publish_time":"2006-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malanoski, Anthony P.; Lin, Baochuan; Wang, Zheng; Schnur, Joel M.; Stenger, David A.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eb6e165ee705e2ae2a24ed2d4e67da42831ff4a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d4f0247db5e916c20eae3f6d772e8572eb828236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1636417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1636417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis time","detailed information","sequence of base calls","partial sequence data","nucleic acid sequence information","unassisted analysis","approach","assay time","significant pathogens","entries","automated analysis methods","assay method","multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays","successful algorithm","genetic databases","Taxonomic databases","multiple pathogen assays","larger amounts of data","results","maximum level","increasing recognition","treatment","surveillance","non-expert","diagnosis","continued development","identification criteria","paper","costs","microorganism"],"language":"en"},

RSV bronchiolitis in infants is associated with a transient decline in circulating lymphocytes. We hypothesized that the mechanism underlying this lymphopenia is apoptosis. Blood was taken from 32 infants during primary RSV bronchiolitis and three months later. Using flow cytometry, we found that absolute numbers of both CD3\u002B/CD4\u002B T-helper lymphocytes (P = 0\u00B7029) and CD3\u002B/CD8\u002B cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) (P = 0\u00B7043) were significantly reduced during acute infection. Up-regulated expression both of Fas (P \u003C 0\u00B7001) and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor (P \u003C 0\u00B7001) was found during acute illness on both CD3\u002B/CD4\u002B and CD3\u002B/CD8\u002B lymphocytes, when compared with convalescent samples. Expression of Fas on CD4\u002B lymphocytes was inversely related to CD4\u002B number (P = 0\u00B703). Plasma levels of soluble Fas ligand (P = 0\u00B7028) and caspase-1 (P = 0\u00B7037), determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were increased during bronchiolitis. Plasma interleukin-18, a product of caspase-1 activity, was not raised. Taken together, these data suggest that in acute RSV infection, CD4\u002B helper lymphocytes and CD8\u002B cytotoxic lymphocytes are primed to undergo apoptosis. This is a mechanism through which lymphopenia may occur and T cell memory may be altered.","publish_time":"2004-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"ROE, M F E; BLOXHAM, D M; WHITE, D K; ROSS-RUSSELL, R I; TASKER, R T C; O\u0027DONNELL, D R","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0686210bae04e4294f988d42f2acc8d4c5435945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1809083.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1809083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD4","cytotoxic lymphocytes","T-helper lymphocytes","circulating lymphocytes","CD3","acute RSV infection","CD8","acute infection","primary RSV bronchiolitis","Expression of Fas","infants","lymphopenia","acute illness","mechanism","Plasma levels of soluble Fas ligand","development of T cell memory responses","tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis","regulated expression","Plasma interleukin","product of caspase","TRAIL","effect","absolute numbers","Respiratory syncytial virus","transient decline","CTL","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","months","receptor","data","flow cytometry","activity","convalescent samples","Blood"],"language":"en"},

A major factor in the host range of a coronavirus is its receptor utilization on host cells. In many cases, coronavirus-receptor interactions are well understood. However, a notable exception is the receptor utilization by group 3 coronaviruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) serves as a functional receptor for most group 1 coronaviruses including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). A recent report has also suggested a role for fAPN during IBV entry (Miguel B, Pharr GT, Wang C: The role of feline aminopeptidase N as a receptor for infectious bronchitis virus. Brief review. Arch Virol 2002, 147:2047\u20132056. RESULTS: Here we show that, whereas both transient transfection and constitutive expression of fAPN on BHK-21 cells can rescue FIPV and TGEV infection in non-permissive BHK cells, fAPN expression does not rescue infection by the prototype IBV strain Mass41. To account for the previous suggestion that fAPN could serve as an IBV receptor, we show that feline cells can be infected with the prototype strain of IBV (Mass 41), but with low susceptibility compared to primary chick kidney cells. We also show that BHK-21 cells are slightly susceptible to certain IBV strains, including Ark99, Ark_DPI, CA99, and Iowa97 (\u003C0.01% efficiency), but this level of infection is not increased by fAPN expression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that fAPN is not a functional receptor for IBV, the identity of which is currently under investigation.","publish_time":"2007-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Victor C; McElroy, Lisa J; Aronson, Jed M; Oura, Trisha J; Harbison, Carole E; Bauman, Beverley E; Whittaker, Gary R","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cb893552a3e4a8aa105a96476b02c16bf7bef42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1810517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1810517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV receptor","fAPN expression","feline cells","receptor utilization","functional receptor","IBV entry","coronavirus-receptor interactions","host cells","constitutive expression of fAPN","prototype strain of IBV","feline infectious peritonitis virus","Coronaviruses","certain IBV strains","prototype IBV strain Mass41","avian infectious bronchitis virus","non-permissive BHK cells","TGEV infection","canine coronavirus","human coronavirus","role of feline aminopeptidase N","primary chick kidney cells","FIPV","group","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","level of infection","important cause of infectious diseases","host range","humans","Miguel B","Pharr GT","Wang C","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","low susceptibility","Ark99","continued potential","emergence","animal species","HCoV","transient transfection","identity","notable exception","CA99","major factor","BACKGROUND","cases","efficiency","Iowa97","recent report","previous suggestion","Brief review","Arch Virol","investigation","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This paper reanalyzes the temporal distribution of pandemic influenza in Prussia, Germany, from 1918\u201319 using the daily numbers of deaths, which totaled 8911 from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919, and the distribution of the time delay from onset to death in order to estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at a given time. RESULTS: A discrete-time branching process was applied to back-calculated incidence data, assuming three different serial intervals (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 days). The estimated reproduction numbers exhibited a clear association between the estimates and choice of serial interval; i.e. the longer the assumed serial interval, the higher the reproduction number. Moreover, the estimated reproduction numbers did not decline monotonically with time, indicating that the patterns of secondary transmission varied with time. These tendencies are consistent with the differences in estimates of the reproduction number of pandemic influenza in recent studies; high estimates probably originate from a long serial interval and a model assumption about transmission rate that takes no account of time variation and is applied to the entire epidemic curve. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that in order to offer robust assessments it is critically important to clarify in detail the natural history of a disease (e.g. including the serial interval) as well as heterogeneous patterns of transmission. In addition, given that human contact behavior probably influences transmissibility, individual countermeasures (e.g. household quarantine and mask-wearing) need to be explored to construct effective non-pharmaceutical interventions.","publish_time":"2007-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb07f3436bd925c0de35ecbe26930536e8bcf200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1892008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1892008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Prussia"],"keyphrases":["given time","time delay","Time variations","reproduction number of pandemic influenza","effective reproduction number","long serial interval","choice of serial interval","assumed serial interval","estimated reproduction numbers","account of time variation","patterns of secondary transmission","transmission potential","transmission rate","discrete-time branching process","different serial intervals","heterogeneous patterns of transmission","temporal distribution of pandemic influenza","high estimates","order","actual average number of secondary cases","daily numbers of deaths","effective non-pharmaceutical interventions","primary case","recent studies","individual countermeasures","transmissibility","model assumption","clear association","human contact behavior","Prussia","onset","Rt","differences","household quarantine","calculated incidence data","disease","BACKGROUND","addition","mask","present findings","robust assessments","RESULTS","paper","Germany","regard","natural history","entire epidemic curve","CONCLUSION","tendencies","days"],"language":"en"},

Much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs, but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. METHODS: We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic. In particular, we examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. RESULTS: A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production. However, it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners, hospitals or even whole public health systems, causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care.","publish_time":"2007-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duerr, Hans P; Brockmann, Stefan O; Piechotowski, Isolde; Schwehm, Markus; Eichner, Martin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/555bbbbd23da02c97c6a4238937e31b5781438a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1939851.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1939851/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-pharmaceutical measures","non-pharmaceutical interventions","pandemic wave","administration of antiviral drugs","timely application of antiviral drugs","early distribution of antiviral drugs","quick implementation of contact reduction measures","initiation of antiviral treatment","Influenza pandemic preparedness plans","success of interventions","limited stockpile","epidemic","height","peak","social distancing measures","parsimonious use","bottlenecks","restricted stockpiles","intervention schedules","isolation of cases","hospitals","public health systems","available planning tool InfluSim","emergency medical care","BACKGROUND","course","CONCLUSION","sensitivity analyses","general practitioners","mitigation strategies","mathematical models","vaccine development","various factors","Delays","RESULTS","protraction","pessimistic outcomes","international levels","advantage","production","paradoxical effect","effectiveness","attention","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms. RESULTS: Twelve new potential reference genes were identified from microarray data. One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper\u00A9 and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology. CONCLUSION: Microarray data normalised by a conventional manner can be filtered using a simple stepwise procedure to identify new reference genes, some of which will demonstrate good measures of stability. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is a new reference gene worthy of investigation in other canine tissues and diseases. Different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes, when co-regulation is not present.","publish_time":"2007-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maccoux, Lindsey J; Clements, Dylan N; Salway, Fiona; Day, Philip JR","journal":"BMC Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c42f08c1803b6a13e7ff20041f34d336e4b0c7e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1976117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1976117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new reference genes","new potential reference genes","Reference gene expression stability","rank ordering of reference genes","used reference gene glyceraldehyde","microarray data","housekeeping genes","candidate genes","new reference gene worthy of investigation","Different methods of reference gene stability assessment","gene HIRA","accurate measure of gene expression","different articular tissue","transformation of data","canine tissues","different tissue types","osteoarthritic canine articular tissues","comparison of different samples","real-time RT-qPCR methodology","different mathematical algorithms","RT-qPCR assays","mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7","basis of constitutive expression","conventional manner","present","good measures of stability","Real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction","ligament","bone","total RNA","ranking","BACKGROUND","cartilage","simple stepwise procedure","disease situations","phosphate dehydrogenase","consistent agreement","biological systems","synovium","isoform","MRPS7","RESULTS","quantification of changes","fat","process","organism","diseases","co-regulation","Bestkeeper","geNorm","GAPDH","HIRP5","normalisation","identity","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We developed a rapid method to amplify and sequence the whole SARS-CoV genome from clinical specimens. The technique employed one-step multiplex RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS-CoV genome, and then nested PCR was performed to amplify a 2-kb region separately. The PCR products were sequenced. RESULTS: We sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV from 3 clinical specimens obtained in Taiwan. The sequences were similar to those reported by other groups, except that 17 single nucleotide variations and two 2-nucleotide deletions, and a 1-nucleotide deletion were found. All the variations in the clinical specimens did not alter the amino acid sequence. Of these 17 sequenced variants, two loci (positions 26203 and 27812) were segregated together as a specific genotype-T:T or C:C. Phylogenetic analysis showed two major clusters of SARS patients in Taiwan.

Although a number of studies have reported the usefulness of I-ASV, the clinical situations in which it may be useful have not yet been clarified. We aimed to report our initial 3 years of experience using I-ASV, particularly the clinical conditions and the technical and organizational factors associated with its use. Furthermore, we evaluated the usefulness of I-ASV and determined the predictive factors for successful management with I-ASV. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective observational study included patients who were ventilated using the Hamilton G5\u00AE ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, Rh\u00E4z\u00FCns, Switzerland) from January 2016 to December 2018. The patients were categorized into the \u201CI-ASV success\u201D group and \u201CI-ASV failure\u201D group (those receiving mechanical ventilation with I-ASV along with any other mode). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with successful I-ASV management. RESULTS: Of the 189 patients, 135 (71.4%) were categorized into the I-ASV success group. In the I-ASV success group, the reasons for ICU admission included post-elective surgery (94.1%), post-emergent surgery (81.5%), and other medical reasons (55.6%). I-ASV failure was associated with a low P/F ratio (278 vs. 167, P = 0.0003) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (21 vs. 26, P \u003C 0.0001). The main reasons for not using I-ASV included strong inspiratory effort and asynchrony. The APACHE II score was an independent predictive factor for successful management with I-ASV, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidential interval 0.87\u20130.96, P = 0.0006). The area under the receiver operating curve for the APACHE II score was 0.722 (cut-off: 24). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that 71.4% of the fully mechanically ventilated patients could be managed successfully with I-ASV. The APACHE II score was an independent factor that could help predict the successful management of I-ASV. To improve I-ASV management, it is necessary to focus on patient-ventilator interactions.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katayama, Shinshu; Tonai, Ken; Shima, Jun; Koyama, Kansuke; Nunomiya, Shin","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac87da21457373b40c86d41851143e701ac8afc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hamilton"],"organizations":["Hamilton Medical AG","ICU"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["successful I-ASV management","I-ASV success group","ASV failure","INTELLiVENT-ASV","successful management","APACHE","score","ventilated patients","predictive factors","medical reasons","low P","independent predictive factor","organizational factors","independent factor","mechanical ventilation","ventilation settings","main reasons","usefulness","closed-loop ventilation mode","Hamilton Medical AG","post-elective surgery","post-emergent surgery","Hamilton G5","clinical conditions","F ratio","clinical situations","odds ratio","retrospective observational study","patient-ventilator interactions","Chronic Health Evaluation","ICU admission","high Acute Physiology","single-center","Rh\u00E4z\u00FCns","Switzerland","strong inspiratory effort","asynchrony","curve","receiver","years of experience","confidential interval","area","METHODS","number of studies","Multivariate analysis","BACKGROUND","cut-off","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that the antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses (T-CMI) of elderly adults to a vaccine intended for intramuscular (IM) administration would be attenuated when deposited into SC fat, independent of confounding conditions. RESULTS: Fifty-two healthy, community dwelling elderly adults (65\u201382 years), seronegative for HBV, were enrolled in the SENIEUR protocol as a strictly healthy population. These seniors were randomized to receive a licensed alum-adjuvanted recombinant HBV vaccine either SC or IM, with the inoculum site verified by imaging. The response rates, defined as hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) \u226510 IU/L, were significantly lower in the elderly than in young adults, a group of 12, healthy, 21\u201334-year-old volunteers. Moreover, elderly participants who received the vaccine IM were significantly more likely to be responders than those immunized SC (54% versus 16%, p = 0.008). The low seroconversion rate in the IM group progressively declined with increasing age, and responders had significantly lower HBsAb titers and limited isotype responses. Moreover, T-CMI (proliferation and cytokine production) were significantly reduced in both percentage of responders and intensity of the response for both Th1 and Th2 subsets in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the blunted immunogenicity of SC inoculation as measured by peak titers and response rates. Further, the qualitative and quantitative deficits in B- and T-CMI responses to primary alum adjuvanted protein antigens persisted even in strictly healthy elderly populations with verified IM placement compared to younger populations.

METHODS: Women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAIs were randomized to either estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal maturation, vaginal pH, and total and individual scores of symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy were assessed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12; sexual functioning was also evaluated using the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) questionnaire, as well as circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). RESULTS: Sixty-one women with a mean age of 59 years were included: 50 received 0.005% estriol vaginal gel and 11 received placebo. Active treatment significantly improved maturation value and pH, vaginal dryness and global scores of symptoms and signs. Active treatment also increased the total FSFI score and all the FSFI domains, with the exception of pain. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, which remained within the postmenopausal range.

Evidence is presented which suggests that hypotheses presented by Kirkpatrick \u0026 Brown relating to endemic species in Tasmania are either invalid or of limited importance for woody rainforest species. In their place three hypotheses are presented to account for the presence of endemic species in Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest on the basis of the fossil record and the distribution of species which are closely related to the endemics. The first two hypotheses relate to the presence of the endemic species in the general Tasmanian region. They are: 1.. Some species evolved in southeastern Australia during the Tertiary in response to the changing climate. Some of the ancestral species still occur in temperate rainforest at lower latitudes in Australia. 2..

Recent studies have shown that vitamin B1 (V(B)(1)) and vitamin C (Vc) can inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, but the precise mechanism is still not well understood. In the present study, we have used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to analyze the transcriptional, metabolic and methylation profiles of Mycobacterium bovis BCG when treated with V(B)(1) and Vc. Our results show that, after vitamin treatment, variant metabolites were mainly clustered in pathways related to amino acid metabolism. Treatment with both vitamins significantly up-regulated the gene encoding cysteine synthase A. Additionally, only BCG that was treated with V(C) showed m4c modifications. Genes harboring this methylation were up-regulated, suggesting that m4c methylation can promote gene transcription to some extent. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the effects of V(B)(1) and V(C), and suggests that these vitamins constitute potential anti-tuberculosis drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Ningning; Zhu, Yongqiang; Cui, Yingying; Lv, Mingyue; Tang, Yiyi; Cui, Ziyin; Dang, Guanghui; Zheng, Huajun; Liu, Siguo","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fcb93b865d4cd7475c07683c14f5920bf6fb0f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vitamins","effects of V","vitamin C","vitamin treatment","m4c methylation","RNA-sequencing","vitamin B1","Vc","methylation profiles of Mycobacterium bovis BCG","Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth","cellular metabolism","gene transcription","m4c modifications","present study","amino acid metabolism","potential anti-tuberculosis drugs","key cofactors of enzymes","LC-MS","liquid chromatography","mass spectrometry","single-molecule real-time","pathways","SMRT","essential nutrients","variant metabolites","precise mechanism","Recent studies","cysteine synthase","understanding","extent","results","immune system","Genes"],"language":"en"},

Development of ARDS biomarkers has been in a state of continuous flux during the past four decades. To address ARDS heterogeneity, several studies have recently focused on subphenotyping the disease on the basis of observable clinical characteristics and associated blood biomarkers. However, the strong correlation between identified biomarkers and ARDS subphenotypes has yet to establish etiology; hence, there is a need for the adoption of other methodologies for studying ARDS. In this review, we will shed light on ARDS metabolomics research in the literature and discuss advances and major obstacles encountered in ARDS metabolomics research. Generally, the ARDS metabolomics studies focused on identification of differentiating metabolites for diagnosing ARDS, but they were performed to different standards in terms of sample size, selection of control cohort, type of specimens collected, and measuring technique utilized. Virtually none of these studies have been properly validated to identify true metabolomics biomarkers of ARDS. Though in their infancy, metabolomics studies exhibit promise to unfold the biological processes underlying ARDS and, in our opinion, have great potential for pushing forward our present understanding of ARDS.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metwaly, Sayed; Cote, Andreanne; Donnelly, Sarah J.; Banoei, Mohammad M.; Mourad, Ahmed I.; Winston, Brent W.","journal":"Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191388.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS metabolomics studies","ARDS subphenotypes","diagnosing ARDS","ARDS heterogeneity","ARDS metabolomics research","Development of ARDS biomarkers","true metabolomics biomarkers of ARDS","present understanding of ARDS","metabolomics studies exhibit","identified biomarkers","associated blood biomarkers","basis of observable clinical characteristics","constellation of clinical findings","terms of sample size","acute respiratory distress syndrome","selection of control cohort","laboratory tests","literature","major obstacles","identification of differentiating metabolites","diagnostic test","advances","strong correlation","state of continuous flux","type of specimens","different standards","disease","light","great potential","radiological images","biological processes","decades","adoption","methodologies","opinion","subphenotyping","condition","infancy","need","etiology","technique","review","date"],"language":"en"},

The loss of control in trafficking these cells contributes to inflammatory diseases. Leukocyte recruitment is a well-orchestrated process that includes several protein families including the large cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines, the chemokines. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from clinical events including major surgery, trauma, multiple transfusions, severe burns, pancreatitis, and sepsis. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome involves activation of alveolar macrophages and sequestered neutrophils in the lung. The clinical hallmarks of ARDS are severe hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and normal intracardiac filling pressures. The magnitude and duration of the inflammatory process may ultimately determine the outcome in patients with ARDS. Recent evidence shows that activated leukocytes and chemokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The expanding number of antagonists of chemokine receptors for inflammatory disorders may hold promise for new medicines to combat ARDS.","publish_time":"2005-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Puneet, Padmam; Moochhala, Shabbir; Bhatia, Madhav","journal":"Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory disorders","inflammatory process","inflammatory diseases","pathogenesis of ARDS","Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","chemokines","uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response","clinical hallmarks of ARDS","excessive recruitment of leukocytes","Acute lung injury","severe hypoxemia","severe burns","clinical events","activated leukocytes","chemokine receptors","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Leukocyte recruitment","well-orchestrated process","trauma","diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates","activation of alveolar macrophages","multiple transfusions","protein families","major surgery","large cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines","normal intracardiac filling pressures","key role","pancreatitis","sequestered neutrophils","expanding number of antagonists","cells","outcome","Recent evidence","new medicines","sepsis","site of inflammation","magnitude","duration","characteristic feature","loss of control","patients"],"language":"en"},

Porcine models were ventilated mechanically. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered endotracheally and in the pulmonary artery to induce ARDS. PFR was measured using a customized particles in exhaled air (PExA 2.0) device. In contrast to control animals undergoing mechanical ventilation and receiving saline administration, animals who received LPS developed ARDS according to clinical guidelines and histologic assessment. Plasma levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 increased significantly compared with baseline after 120 and 180 min, respectively.

On this occasion while preparing for an avian, highly virulent influenza virus (H5N1 like) originating in Asia in fact the pandemic originated from swine, and was less virulent. This discrepancy between what was planned for and what emerged created its own challenges. The H1N1 pandemic has tested national health\u2010care infrastructures and exposed shortcomings in our preparedness as a region. Key health challenges include communication throughout the region, surge capacity, access to reliable information and access to quality care, health\u2010care worker skills, quality, density and distribution, access to essential medicines and lack of organizational infrastructure for emergency response. Despite years of preparation the public health and clinical research community were not ready to respond and opportunities for an immediate research response were missed.

This study identified the various clinical prognostic factors for SARS and described the temporal evolution of these factors in the course of the SARS illness in Hong Kong in 2003. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the entire Hong Kong cohort of 1312 laboratory\u2010confirmed SARS patients aged 15\u201374 years was undertaken. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at presentation and investigative data during the first 10 days of illness from the time of symptom onset were compiled. Two adverse outcomes were examined: hospital mortality and the development of oxygenation failure based on the estimated PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of \u003C200 mm Hg. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between these prognostic factors and outcomes. Results: Based on adjusted odds ratios with a P\u2010value of \u003C0.05, older age, male gender, elevated pulse rate and elevated neutrophil count were all predictive of oxygenation failure and death during the 10\u2010day illness. Raised serum albumin and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were predictive of hospital mortality during this period. The presenting ALT and CPK level and the day 7 and day 10 platelet counts were predictive of oxygenation failure while the day 7 LDH was predictive of death. Contact exposure outside health\u2010care institutions also appeared to carry higher risk of death. Conclusion: This large\u2010scale analysis identified important discriminatory parameters related to the patients\u2019 demographic profile (age and gender), severity of illness (pulse rate and neutrophil count), and multisystem derangement (platelet count, CPK, ALT and LDH), all of which prognosticated adverse outcomes during the SARS episode. While age, pulse rate and neutrophil count consistently remained significant prognosticators during the first 10 days of illness, the prognostic impact of other derangements was more time\u2010course dependent. Clinicians should be aware of the time\u2010course evolution of these prognosticators.","publish_time":"2007-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHAN, Jane C.K.; TSUI, Eva L.H.; WONG, Vivian C.W.","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/980c38201fd0b06047cdc4e7f6d8cabd5e648f63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192325.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ALT"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS illness","day illness","predictive of death","days of illness","predictive of oxygenation failure","elevated neutrophil count","SARS patients","SARS episode","severity of illness","elevated pulse rate","predictive of hospital mortality","prognostic impact","various clinical prognostic factors","course evolution","adverse outcomes","development of oxygenation failure","laboratory data","temporal importance of prognostic indicators","CPK level","older age","temporal evolution","LDH","course dependent","time of symptom onset","higher risk of death","male gender","platelet counts","large\u2010scale analysis","retrospective analysis","investigative data","entire Hong Kong cohort","significant prognosticators","presenting ALT","patients\u2019 demographic profile","severe acute respiratory syndrome","important discriminatory parameters","levels","multisystem derangement","care institutions","creatinine phosphokinase","value","presentation","derangements","adjusted odds ratios","Contact exposure","health","serum albumin","objective","estimated PaO","study","association","FiO","Results","Conclusion","Background","period","Methods","Clinicians","years","Logistic regression","Hg"],"language":"en"},

Close correlations between specific leaf area (SLA) and relative growth rate (RGR) have been reported in many studies. However, theoretically, SLA by itself has small net positive effect on RGR because any increase in SLA inevitably causes a decrease in area\u2010based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC(a)), another RGR component. It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNC(a). \u2022 . Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis. \u2022 . SLA varied 1.9\u2010fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a 47% decrease in LNC(a) along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9\u2010fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNC(a). Consequently, LNC(a )values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA\u2013RGR relationship was achieved. \u2022 .

Overall, these results suggest that mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.","publish_time":"2010-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callahan, K.L.; Beck, N.K.; Duffield, E.A.; Shin, G.; Meschke, J.S.","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd837c9fd2d083f6ff5366dd6c5bc3958dc6b7cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soft surfaces","Contaminated environmental surfaces","soft porous surfaces","various environmental surfaces","mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant","residual disinfectant","disinfectant solution","efficacy of mist application","uniform mist application","tile","VRE","MRSA","carpet","steel","glass","quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant","reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens","human pathogens","contaminating organisms","cotton fabric","test bacteria","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium","stabilized chlorine dioxide","inactivation of methicillin","effective option","use","important reservoirs","transmission","brain heart infusion","BHI","agar","significant disinfection","hr of contact time","study","results","options","Log"],"language":"en"},

Contemporary species distributions are determined by a mixture of ecological and historical filters acting on several spatial and temporal scales. Mediterranean climate areas are one of the world\u0027s biodiversity hotspots with a high level of endemicity, which is linked to complex ecological and historical factors. 2. This paper explores the ecological and historical factors constraining the distribution of caddisfly species on a large regional scale. A total of 69 taxa were collected from 140 sampling sites in 10 Iberian Mediterranean river basins. Approximately 74% of taxa can be considered rare, with the southern basins (the Baetic\u2013Riffian region) having greater endemicity. The greatest richness, involving a mixture of northern and southern species, was found in the transitional area between the Baetic\u2013Riffian region and the Hesperic Massif. 3. The historical processes occurring during the Tertiary (i.e. the junction of the Eurasian and African plates) explained 3.1% of species distribution, whereas ecological factors accounted for 20.7%. Only 0.3% was explained by the interaction of history and ecology. A set of multi\u2010scale ecological variables (i.e. basin, reach and bedform characteristics) defined five river types with specific caddisfly assemblages. The commonest caddisfly species accounted for the regional distribution pattern, while rare taxa contributed to the explanation of subtle patterns not shown by common species. 4. Despite the importance of historical factors for biogeography and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. This may be explained by the length of time since the historical process we are considering, the high dispersion and colonisation capacity of many caddisfly species, and the strong environmental gradient in the area. Because of the historical and environmental complexity of Mediterranean areas, rare taxa should be included in ecological studies so that the singularity of these ecosystems is not missed.","publish_time":"2005-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"BONADA, N\u00DARIA; ZAMORA\u2010MU\u00D1OZ, CARMEN; RIERADEVALL, MARIA; PRAT, NARC\u00CDS","journal":"Freshw Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e54388a2e4340a88a541a07dad2e446ce6966f38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201900.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iberian Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["ecological factors","distribution of caddisfly species","caddisfly distribution","southern species","mixture of ecological","commonest caddisfly species","common species","historical filters","ecological studies","importance of historical factors","historical processes","rare taxa","Contemporary species distributions","set of multi\u2010scale ecological variables","large scale","large regional scale","specific caddisfly assemblages","regional distribution pattern","Riffian region","Baetic","environmental complexity of Mediterranean areas","Iberian Mediterranean river basins","Mediterranean climate areas","southern basins","high level of endemicity","river types","mixture of northern","high dispersion","greater endemicity","transitional area","strong environmental gradient","sampling sites","world\u0027s biodiversity hotspots","colonisation capacity","biogeography","study","explanation of subtle patterns","junction","bedform characteristics","African plates","Hesperic Massif","Eurasian","singularity","Tertiary","length of time","paper","temporal scales","greatest richness","interaction of history","ecology","ecosystems","total"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the potential for disease spillover from the domestic dog population to the wild carnivore population in the Isoso of Bolivia, an area of tropical dry forest contiguous with a national park. Using questionnaires and discussions with residents, we gathered data on the demography of dogs in the Isoso, including adult and neonatal mortality, litter size, and hunting frequency. We analyzed a large data set containing self\u2010recorded information on hunting in various communities of the Isoso to determine the extent of dog participation in hunting and the duration of hunting trips. Finally, we took blood samples from dogs in the Isoso for a serosurvey of common canine pathogens. More than 95% of dogs had positive titers to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. There was also a high seroprevalence in dogs for other pathogens, a high population turnover of dogs (which may allow diseases to be maintained endemically), and frequent opportunities for contact between domestic and wild carnivores.

We aimed to establish a modern sTBI protocol for adult patients with both intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain oxygen monitors in place. METHODS: Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents. Having previously established a protocol for the treatment of patients with ICP monitoring alone, we addressed patients who have a brain oxygen monitor in addition to an ICP monitor. The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. RESULTS: We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present. The panel considered issues pertaining to blood transfusion and ventilator management when designing the different algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: These protocols are intended to assist clinicians in the management of patients with both ICP and brain oxygen monitors but they do not reflect either a standard-of-care or a substitute for thoughtful individualized management. These protocols should be used in conjunction with recommendations for basic care, management of critical neuroworsening and weaning treatment recently published in conjunction with the Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference.

Since the 1970s, PED outbreaks have become a source of problems in pig producing countries all over the world, causing large economic losses for pig producers. Although the infection in adults is not fatal, in na\u00EFve suckling piglets mortality is close to 100%. In this study, we investigated genome\u2010wide differences between dead and recovered suckling piglets from commercial farms after PED outbreaks. Samples from 262 animals (156 dead and 106 recovered) belonging to several commercial lines were collected from five different farms in three different countries (USA, Canada and Germany) and genotyped with the porcine 80K SNP chip. Mean F (st) value was calculated in 1\u2010Mb non\u2010overlapping windows between dead and recovered individuals, and the results were normalized to find differences within the comparison. Seven windows with high divergence between dead and recovered were detected\u2014five on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 15\u2014in total encompassing 152 genes. Several of these genes are either under\u2010 or overexpressed in many virus infections, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS\u2010CoV). A total of 32 genes are included in one or more Gene Ontology terms that can be related to PED development, such as Golgi apparatus, as well as mechanisms generally linked to resilience or diarrhea development (cell proliferation, ion transport, ATPase activity).

Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges. \u2022 Methods: We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution. \u2022 Key results: Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous phyllotaxy on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral lateral spikelets. Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae. \u2022 Conclusions: Ontogenetic changes in phyllotaxy differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of phyllotaxy in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents the boundary between the bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological\u2010misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event.

Methods: In a group of 16 patients (eight all_ergic), nasal brush samples were taken, and nasal symptoms were recorded during common cold, 2 weeks later (convalescence), and at baseline (\u003E4 weeks without nasal symptoms). Nasal brush cells were stained immunohistochemicall_y for Langerhans cells, T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, eosinophils, eotaxin, and RANTES. Results: Four rhinovirus, four coronavirus, three RSV, one Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and one influenza A/enterovirus double infection were confirmed. Increased numbers of T cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, eosinophils, and RANTES\u2010 and eotaxin\u2010positive cells, but not neutrophils, were observed during common cold in all_ergic and nonall_ergic patients, and increased numbers of mast cells in all_ergic patients.

Methods: We administered a survey to healthcare workers to determine risk factors associated with development of headaches (frequency, headache subtypes and duration of face\u2010mask wear) and the impact of headaches (sick days, headache frequency and use of abortive/preventive headache medications). Results: In the survey, 212 (47 male, 165 female) healthcare workers of mean age 31 years (range, 21\u201358) participated. Of the 79 (37.3%) respondents who reported face\u2010mask\u2010associated headaches, 26 (32.9%) reported headache frequency exceeding six times per month. Six (7.6%) had taken sick leave from March 2003 to June 2004 (mean 2 days; range 1\u20134 days) and 47 (59.5%) required use of abortive analgesics because of headache.

Design A serological survey of antibodies to CCV among different dog populations. Procedure The development and characterisation of an indirect ELISA for the detection of antibodies (IgG and IgM) to CCV was undertaken. Sera collected from both diarrhoeal and non\u2010diarrhoeal dogs from various populations throughout Australia were tested for these antibodies to CCV. Results Serum samples (1396) collected from 1984 to 1998 were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies to CCV. Samples were divided into two categories on the basis of the number of dogs housed together. The groups were either an open population containing dogs housed as groups of three or less, or kennel populations. Sera from 15.8% of the open population and 40.8% of kennelled dogs were positive for CCV antibodies. The prevalence of antibodies varied from zero to 76% in kennelled dogs. About 23% of 128 dogs positive for IgG antibodies to CCV were also positive for IgM antibodies to CCV, indicating recent CCV infection. Of those dogs that were presented with clinical signs of gastroenteritis such as diarrhoea and vomiting(n = 29), 85% were positive in the IgM ELISA and 85.7% in the IgG ELISA for antibodies to CCV. In comparison, for those dogs presented without any history of gastroenteritis only 15% were positive for IgM and 30% positive for IgG. Conclusion Serological evidence indicates that infection with CCV in dogs is widespread throughout the Australian mainland. The prevalence of antibodies varies greatly among different populations, with an average of 40.8% positive in kennelled populations and 15.8% in the open population.","publish_time":"2008-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"NAYLOR, MJ; MONCKTON, RP; LEHRBACH, PR; DEANE, EM","journal":"Aust Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1eacbd24a23bfcc34b50506c2b37f9bddbd78b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["CCV","IgM ELISA","IgG ELISA"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["CCV antibodies","IgM antibodies","dogs positive","role of CCV","prevalence of antibodies","detection of antibodies","presence of IgG antibodies","kennelled dogs","recent CCV infection","number of dogs","frequency of serum antibodies","serological survey of antibodies","IgG ELISA","non\u2010diarrhoeal dogs","IgM ELISA","kennelled populations","different populations","open population","various populations","different dog populations","kennel populations","Australian dog population","indirect ELISA","history of gastroenteritis","groups","Sera","clinical signs of gastroenteritis","causative agent of gastroenteritis","Results Serum samples","Australian mainland","Conclusion Serological evidence","canine coronavirus","development","characterisation","average","categories","vomiting","basis","Procedure","Objective","comparison"],"language":"en"},

A systematic content review","doi":"10.1186/s12889-020-08570-3","pmcid":"PMC7161003","pubmed_id":"32295570","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience some of the highest rates of otitis media in the world. Key risk factors for otitis media in Aboriginal children in Australia are largely social and environmental factors such as overcrowded housing, poverty and limited access to services. Despite this, little is known about how to address these risk factors. A scoping content review was performed to determine the relationship between social determinants of health and otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children as described by peer-reviewed and grey literature. METHOD: Search terms were established for location, population and health condition. The search terms were used to conduct a literature search using six health research databases. Following the exclusion process, articles were scoped, analysed and categorised using scoping parameters and a social determinants of health framework. RESULTS: Housing-related issues were the most frequently reported determinants for otitis media (56%). Two articles (4%) directly investigated the impact of social determinants of health on rates of otitis media within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The majority of the literature (68%) highlights social determinants as playing a key role in the high rates of otitis media seen in Aboriginal populations in Australia. There were no intervention studies targeting social determinants as a means to reduce otitis media rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies a disconnect between otitis media drivers and the focus of public health interventions within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Despite consensus that social determinants play a key role in the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, the majority of intervention studies within the literature are focussed on biomedical approaches such as research on vaccines and antibiotics. This review highlights the need for otitis media intervention studies to shift away from a purely biomedical model and toward investigating the underlying social determinants of health. By shifting interventions upstream, otitis media rates may decrease within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, as focus is shifted away from a treatment-focussed model and toward a more preventative model.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeLacy, Jack; Dune, Tinashe; Macdonald, John J.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f089a39160dee4f2db2d77361baad7b45a1ffa06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Torres Strait","Australia"],"keyphrases":["otitis media rates","Aboriginal children","otitis media drivers","high rates of otitis media","highest rates of otitis media","Torres Strait Islander children","otitis media intervention studies","underlying social determinants of health","impact of social determinants of health","social determinants of health framework","Torres Strait Islander populations","Aboriginal populations","reported determinants","health condition","literature search","health research databases","focus of public health interventions","Key risk factors","majority of intervention studies","key role","grey literature","biomedical model","Search terms","Australia","environmental factors","preventative model","scoping content review","treatment-focussed model","articles","overcrowded housing","biomedical approaches","scoping parameters","Housing-related issues","poverty","means","limited access","location","peer","need","vaccines","relationship","BACKGROUND","services","RESULTS","consensus","world","exclusion process","antibiotics","METHOD","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

It can also reflect a nested distribution of habitats among the sites or the differential abundance properties of species through passive sampling. This study investigated whether Sonoran Desert woody vegetation in remnant islands within metropolitan Phoenix is nested and explored which mechanisms are responsible for the pattern. It also examined whether vegetation is nested in similar habitat types across islands, and how species abundance relates to the nested pattern and hypothesized mechanisms.

Previously we identified the extra domain to be involved in enzyme dimerization which has been considered essential for the catalytic activity. In an initial attempt to map out the extra\u2010domain residues critical for dimerization, we have systematically generated 15 point mutations, five deletions and one triple mutation and subsequently characterized them by enzymatic assay, dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results led to identification of four regions critical for enzyme dimerization. Interestingly, Asn214Ala mutant with a significant tendency to form a monomer still retained \u2248 30% activity, indicating that the relationship between the activity and dimerization might be very complex. Very surprisingly, two regions (one over Ser284\u2013Thr285\u2013Ile286 and another around Phe291) were discovered on which Ala\u2010mutations significantly increased the enzymatic activities. Based on this, a super\u2010active triple\u2010mutant STI/A with a 3.7\u2010fold activity enhancement was thus engineered by mutating residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 to Ala. The dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR characterizations indicate that the wild\u2010type (WT) and STI/A mutant share similar structural and dimerization properties, thus implying that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms to regulate the catalytic machinery. We rationalized these results based on the enzyme structure and consequently observed an interesting picture: the majority of the dimerization\u2010critical residues plus Ser284\u2013Thr285\u2013Ile286 and Phe291 are clustered together to form a nano\u2010scale channel passing through the central region of the enzyme. We therefore speculate that this channel might play a role in relaying regulatory effects from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery.","publish_time":"2006-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Jiahai; Song, Jianxing","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df00a05447cc7151598ddbdb92f0b1b774d0097b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164011.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR","STI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enzyme dimerization","dimerization properties","catalytic activity","terminal extra domain","extra\u2010domain residues critical","Ile286","Thr285","critical residues","complete catalytic machinery","mutant STI","regions critical","enzyme structure","mutating residues Ser284","fold activity enhancement","dynamic light scattering","CD","C proteases","addition","Asn214Ala mutant","Phe291","results","NMR characterizations","mutant share similar structural","NMR spectroscopy","enzymatic assay","scale channel","triple mutation","enzymatic activities","point mutations","super\u2010active triple","coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","relaying regulatory effects","piconavirus","majority","chymotrypsin","type","role","significant tendency","deletions","interesting picture","WT","central region","identification","mechanisms","monomer","relationship","initial attempt","nano"],"language":"en"},

We report an analysis of 3D\u2010DS in bovine seminal ribonuclease, a homodimeric protein whose subunits are linked by two disulfide bridges, based on NMR and biochemical studies. The presence of the covalent bonds between the subunits stabilizes the unswapped dimer, and allows distinct evaluation of the structural and dynamic effects of the swapping with respect to the dimerization process. In comparison with the monomeric subunit, which, in solution has a compact structure without any propensity for local unfolding, both swapped and unswapped dimers show increased flexibility. NMR analysis, together with urea denaturation and hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange data, indicates that the two dimers have increased conformational fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the rate\u2010limiting step of both the swapping and unswapping pathways is the detachment of the N\u2010terminal helices from the monomers.

A significant number of patients are unable to tolerate the masks and eventually stop using their devices. The goal of this project is to develop custom-fit masks to increase comfort, decrease air leakage, and thereby improve patient compliance. A single-patient case study of a patient with variant ALS was performed to evaluate the custom-fit masks. His high nose bridge and overbite of lower jaw caused poor fit with generic masks, and he was noncompliant with his machine. Using desktop Stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a generic mask was extended with a rigid interface such that it was complementary to the patient\u0027s unique facial contours. Patient or clinicians interactively select a desired mask shape using a newly developed computer program. Subsequently, a compliant silicone layer was applied to the rigid interface. Ten different custom-fit mask designs were made using computer-aided design software. Patient evaluated the comfort, extent of leakage, and satisfaction of each mask via a questionnaire. All custom-fit masks were rated higher than the standard mask except for two.

To explore these subtle host responses, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to investigate the differential gene expression between two groups of liver samples with high and low HCV loads (\u003E100\u2010fold difference). We identified and validated 26 genes that were up\u2010regulated in livers with high HCV loads, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Trypsin inhibitors inhibited the infection of Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells with cell\u2010culture\u2013derived HCV (HCVcc) of Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 isolate at the postbinding and entry step, and trypsin enhanced HCVcc infection at an early stage of infection. Several major transmembrane serine proteases, in particular, furin and hepsin, were detected in Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells, but TMPRSS2 was not. Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cell clones stably expressing TMPRSS2\u2010 WT (wild type) and inactive TMPRSS2\u2010mutant genes showed positive and negative enhancement of their susceptibility to HCVcc infection, respectively. The enhanced susceptibility of TMPRSS2\u2010WT Huh7\u201025\u2010CD81 cells was confirmed by knockdown of TMPRSS2 using small interfering RNA. The cell\u2010surface protease activity of TMPRSS2\u2010WT cells was markedly active in the cleavage of QAR and QGR, corresponding to amino acid residues at P3 to P1. Conclusion: The cell\u2010surface activity of a trypsin\u2010like serine protease, such as TMPRSS2, activates HCV infection at the postbinding and entry stage. Host transmembrane serine proteases may be involved in the sensitivity, persistence, and pathogenesis of HCV infection and be possible targets for antiviral therapy.

In addition, early symptoms of infection warrant caution until the nature and severity of the infection become apparent.

The aim of this study was to investigate causative viruses in patients with PVOD. Study Design and Methods: Nasal discharge was collected from 24 patients with PVOD. We investigated the presence of 10 viruses in nasal discharge and examined the time course, with regard to changes in olfactory dysfunction and nasal obstruction in patients with PVOD, using questionnaires, acoustic rhinometry, and olfactory tests. Results: Rhinoviruses were detected in 10 patients by electrophoresis. Rhinoviruses were also confirmed in four patients by nucleotide sequences. Viral serotypes were identified to be human rhinovirus (HRV)\u201040, HRV\u201075, HRV\u201078, and HRV\u201080. One of the four patients complained of anosmia, whereas another complained of dysosmia. Olfactory testing did not show significant improvement at 4, 8, 11, and 24 weeks after the first visit in the four patients, although results of acoustic rhinometry significantly improved. Two of the four patients complained of olfactory dysfunction even 6 months after the first visit. Coronavirus and parainfluenza virus were detected in one patient each, and Epstein\u2010Barr viruses were detected in three patients. Conclusions: This study for the first time detected rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Epstein\u2010Barr virus in nasal discharge of patients with PVOD. Furthermore, the present study suggests that rhinoviruses can cause olfactory dysfunction through mechanisms other than nasal obstruction and that rhinoviruses can induce various severities and different time courses of olfactory dysfunction.","publish_time":"2009-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Motohiko; Saito, Koichi; Min, Wei\u2010Ping; Vladau, Costin; Toida, Kazunori; Itoh, Hirotaka; Murakami, Shingo","journal":"Laryngoscope","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e4cdbc69493fff167fa29ee0c840efe2730a98c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVOD","Study Design"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal discharge of patients","PVOD","Olfactory testing","olfactory tests","Rhinoviruses","HRV","Causative viruses of postviral olfactory dysfunction","nasal obstruction","different time courses of olfactory dysfunction","Barr viruses","time detected rhinovirus","parainfluenza virus","Study Design","present study","Epstein","Coronavirus","results of acoustic rhinometry","visit","human rhinovirus","changes","various severities","regard","questionnaires","mechanisms","Objective","Methods","significant improvement","months","presence","Viral serotypes","anosmia","nucleotide sequences","dysosmia","weeks","aim","Conclusions","electrophoresis"],"language":"en"},

Similar data for non\u2010tree species with separated genders are inconclusive. Recent studies on pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms (Arecaceae) suggest that species are either insect\u2010 or wind\u2010pollinated. However, the wide variety of inflorescence and floral attributes within the genus suggests mixed pollination mode involving entomophily and anemophily. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the pollination of Chamaedorea costaricana,C. macrospadix,C. pinnatifrons and C. tepejilote in two montane forests in Costa Rica. A complementary morphological analysis of floral traits was carried out to distinguish species groups within the genus according to their most probable pollination mechanism. We conducted pollinator exclusion experiments, field observations on visitors to pistillate and staminate inflorescences, and trapped airborne pollen. A cluster analysis using 18 floral traits selected for their association with wind and insect pollination syndromes was carried out using 52 Chamaedorea species. Exclusion experiments showed that both wind and insects, mostly thrips (Thysanoptera), pollinated the studied species. Thrips used staminate inflorescences as brood sites and pollinated pistillate flowers by deception. Insects caught on pistillate inflorescences transported pollen, while traps proved that pollen is wind\u2010borne. Our empirical findings clearly suggest that pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms is likely to involve both insects and wind. A cluster analysis showed that the majority of studied species have a combination of floral traits that allow for both pollination modes. Our pollination experiments and morphological analysis both suggest that while some species may be completely entomophilous or anemophilous, ambophily might be a common condition within Chamaedorea. Our results propose a higher diversity of pollination mechanisms of Neotropical dioecious species than previously suggested.","publish_time":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00EDos, L.

We examine this question using sequence data from 13 \u2018Serengeti\u2019 strains including five complete genomes obtained between 1993 and 2011. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses reveal that strains from noncanids during the epidemic were more closely related to each other than to those from domestic or wild canids. All noncanid \u2018Serengeti\u2019 strains during the epidemic encoded: (1) one novel substitution G134S in the CDV\u2010V protein; and (2) the rare amino acid combination 519I/549H at two sites under positive selection in the region of the CDV\u2010H protein that binds to SLAM (CD 150) host cell receptors. Worldwide, only a few noncanid strains in the America II lineage encode CDV\u2010H 519I/549H. All canid \u2018Serengeti\u2019 strains during the epidemic coded CDV\u2010V 134G, and CDV\u2010H 519R/549Y, or 519R/549H. A functional assay of cell entry revealed the highest performance by CDV\u2010H proteins encoding 519I/549H in cells expressing lion SLAM receptors, and the highest performance by proteins encoding 519R/549Y, typical of dog strains worldwide, in cells expressing dog SLAM receptors. Our findings are consistent with an epidemic in lions and hyaenas caused by CDV variants better adapted to noncanids than canids, but not with the recent spillover of a dog strain.

Agents targeted at either viral protein 1 (VP1), a relatively conserved capsid structure mediating viral adsorption/uncoating process, or 3C protease, which is highly conserved among different serotypes and essential for viral replication, are of great potential to become antipicornavirus drugs. \u00A9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The spike (S) protein of this virus is a type I surface glycoprotein that mediates binding of the virus to the host receptor and the subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes. Because of its critical role in viral entry, the S protein is an important target for the development of anti\u2010SARS CoV therapeutics and prophylactics. This article reviews the structure and function of the SARS CoV S protein in the context of its role in virus entry. Topics that are discussed include: the interaction between the S1 domain of the SARS spike protein and the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the structural features of the ectodomain of ACE2; the antigenic determinants presented by the S protein and the nature of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that are elicited in vivo; the structure of the 4,3\u2010hydrophobic heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 of the S2 domain and their interaction to form a six\u2010helical bundle during the final stages of fusion. Opportunities for the design and development of anti\u2010SARS agents based on the inhibition of receptor binding, the therapeutic uses of S\u2010directed monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of HR1\u2013HR2 complex formation are presented. \u00A9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The differential diagnosis of these infiltrates depends on their timing after transplantation. The aim of this study was to characterize lung transplant recipients (LTR) presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all LTR and heart\u2013lung transplant recipients attending outpatient follow\u2010up at our institution between September 1, 2006 and October 14, 2011 was performed. All patients presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x\u2010ray who underwent bronchoscopy were included. RESULTS: A total of 913 patients accounted for 13,156 attendances, with 3,912 bronchoscopies being performed. Seventy\u2010eight patients (9%) exhibited new pulmonary infiltrates and proceeded to bronchoscopy. Infiltrates occurred at a median 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 5\u201339) months after transplantation. Forty\u2010eight patients (62%) were male, and median patient age was 47 (IQR 29\u201357) years. Subsequent investigation revealed pneumonia to be the underlying cause in 63 patients (81%). In the remaining patients, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was responsible in 6 (8%), acute rejection in 5 (6%), and toxic pneumonitis in 4 (5%) patients. Overall 1\u2010year survival in LTR presenting with new infiltrates was 97%, compared with 96% for all LTR attending our Outpatient Department. CONCLUSIONS: New pulmonary infiltrates occurring after the first month in LTR are most likely due to infection. Through prompt diagnosis and treatment, early mortality appears unaffected. Late mortality remains attributable to CLAD.","publish_time":"2014-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00EDaz\u2010Ravetllat, V.; Greer, M.; Haverich, A.; Warnecke, G.; Dierich, M.; Welte, T.; Gottlieb, J.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f03560dd2e5d14db5ebed6b0730ff517b504cbcc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTR","Outpatient Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new infiltrates","new pulmonary infiltrates","remaining patients","lung transplantation","lung transplant recipients","IQR","Infection","bronchoscopy","chronic lung allograft dysfunction","outpatient follow\u2010up","early mortality","prompt diagnosis","Outpatient Department","Late mortality","acute rejection","differential diagnosis","median patient age","heart","major complications","treatment","chest x\u2010ray","pneumonia","retrospective analysis","male","study","underlying cause","year survival","interquartile range","BACKGROUND","institution","CONCLUSIONS","Subsequent investigation","METHODS","attendances","RESULTS","total","months","timing","toxic pneumonitis","bronchoscopies","aim","years"],"language":"en"},

But the higher incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei are unique to the region. The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae has been raising the need for more prudent use of antibiotics. Emergence and spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus deserve attention, while the risk has not reached significant level yet in cases of CAP.

Influenza A/H5N1, in particular, has repeatedly caused human infections associated with high mortality, and since 1998 the virus has evolved into many clades of variants with significant antigenic diversity. In 2013, three (A/H7N9, A/H6N1, and A/H10N8) novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) breached the animal-human host species barrier in Asia. In humans, roughly 35% of A/H7N9-infected patients succumbed to the zoonotic infection, and two of three A/H10N8 human infections were also lethal; however, neither of these viruses cause influenza-like symptoms in poultry. While most of these cases were associated with direct contact with infected poultry, some involved sustained human-to-human transmission. Thus, these events elicited concern regarding potential AIV pandemics. This article reviews the human incursions associated with AIV variants and the potential role of pigs as an intermediate host that may hasten AIV evolution. In addition, we discuss the known influenza A virus virulence and transmission factors and their evaluation in animal models. With the growing number of human AIV infections, constant vigilance for the emergence of novel viruses is of utmost importance. In addition, careful characterization and pathobiological assessment of these novel variants will help to identify strains of particular concern for future pandemics.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Se Mi; Kim, Young-Il; Pascua, Philippe Noriel Q.; Choi, Young Ki","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75ec8d63d2e323c686128c2a982027b7fd51b98f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIV"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["human transmission of influenza","human incursions","efficient human","human transmission of avian influenza virus","H10N8 human infections","involved sustained human","novel avian influenza viruses","growing number of human AIV infections","AIV variants","known influenza","animal-human host species barrier","novel variants","emergence of novel viruses","potential AIV pandemics","transmission factors","AIV evolution","clades of variants","infected poultry","virus virulence","decades avian","addition","strains of particular concern","H7N9-infected patients","intermediate host","animal models","future pandemics","potential role of pigs","constant vigilance","pathobiological assessment","AIVs","evaluation","careful characterization","direct contact","significant antigenic diversity","Asia","events","utmost importance","high mortality","zoonotic infection","symptoms","cases","H6N1","article","H5N1","humans"],"language":"en"},

Rotaviruses infections have also been shown to be associated with the elderly, immunocompromised individuals and more recently with epidemic diarrheal illness in adults. Objectives: To study the incidence and the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of rotaviruses in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Study design: A total of 650 stool samples submitted to the laboratories of two University Teaching Hospitals (Al-Ain and Tawam) and a private hospital (Oasis) were examined for the presence of rotaviruses from January 1990\u2013December, 1992, using a commercially available latex agglutination assay. The meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) recorded during the sampling period was analyzed statistically to examine the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of rotavirus cases in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Results: Rotavirus was detected in 21.4% of the samples examined. The predominant number of positive cases (35%) were in the 7\u201312 months age group. It was interesting to find rotavirus-positive cases in as low an age group as \u003C3 months (3.6%) and as high as 10 years (8.04%). There was no significant difference on infection rates between male and female groups in the study. However, there was a significant difference between the national (38.18%) and non-national children (61.28%). The higher rate of the latter may be due to import of infections. There appeared to be a seasonal pattern of rotavirus occurrence in the cases studied, with a marked increase in the number of positive cases during the months when the relative humidity was low (25\u201345%) and there was no rainfall. Conclusions: Rotavirus was detected in all age groups with a predominance in 7\u201312 month age groups, and a higher incidence in non-nationals. There was a marked increase in the number of positive cases during the months when the relative humidity was low (25\u201345%) and there was no rainfall.

It is suggested that susceptible children, adolescents, and adults should be vaccinated against mumps, unless vaccination is contraindicated. Mumps vaccine can be of particular value to children approaching puberty and for adolescents and adults, especially males who have not had mumps in childhood. Ribavirin therapy may be particularly beneficial for children at risk for severe and often fatal RSV infection, such as infants with congenital heart disease. Attenuated measles vaccines have been developed empirically by selection of host range mutants, and are widely and successfully used throughout the world. Using the vaccine, some countries may soon eliminate measles as an endogenous virus but continued problems are anticipated, particularly in adults with viruses re-introduced by visitors from abroad. Basic studies on new antivirals are continuing (particularly with oligopeptides) but antiviral compounds are unlikely to have extended use in the clinic, except perhaps in tropical areas where the disease may be life threatening.

While knowledge about CanL, its management, treatment, prevention and control mounts, it remains unclear whether all clinical veterinarians follow the same international recommendations, such as those of the LeishVet group. This study was thus designed to assess recent trends in the clinical management of CanL in veterinary clinics across Spain through a questionnaire-based survey. Results were compared with those of a prior national multicenter questionnaire administered by our research team in 2005. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 28 questions about CanL was developed using Google Forms and distributed by email to 1428 veterinary clinics in Spain. Questions were designed to obtain data on common clinical signs, techniques and complementary exams used to diagnose the disease, and on its monitoring, treatment and control measures. Data were collected in a database for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 295 clinics. Compared to the situation in 2005, responses indicate that clinical signs of CanL have not changed significantly, cutaneous lesions being still the most prevalent sign observed by practitioners. Quantitative serological techniques are considered an adequate approach to diagnosis, provided their results are supported by the findings of a thorough physical exam, as well as complementary tests (complete blood count, biochemical profile, plasma protein electrophoretogram and complete urinalysis). Treatment protocols and check-ups follow international recommendations. Finally, a multimodal approach is being endorsed to adequately control CanL including preventive measures such as annual serological check-ups and the combination of repellents and vaccines. Additionally, owners are being better informed about CanL by veterinarians, which translates to the improved control of this zoonosis. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of CanL has recently undergone significant changes owing to improvements in clinical knowledge of the disease, more unified international criteria, improved diagnostic techniques and their adequate interpretation, as well as a greater awareness of the disease transmitted to owners.

TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold. Results prove the supremacy of B-CNN for the identification of TB and non-TB sample CXRs as compared to counterparts in terms of accuracy, variance in the predicted probabilities and model uncertainty.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE Access","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a8e14467dda8a59309ecbd9ddb86cd28cae17d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXR","CNN","NVidia Tesla"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B-CNN","identification of TB","TB detection","non-TB sample CXRs","non-TB manifested CXRs","CNN approaches","TB benchmark datasets","proposed TB identification methodology","variance of B","supremacy of B","extraction of complex TB manifestation features","true probability of CXRs","convolutional neural network","complex features","GB of VRAM","GB RAM","confusing cases","GB of disk","confusion cases","uncertain cases","results","Deep learning based approach","model uncertainty","terms of accuracy","predicted probabilities","testing of proposed scheme","state-of-the-art machine learning","lung cavity","endobronchial spread","air space consolidation","pleural effusions","Google Colab platform","NVidia Tesla K80","counterparts","Bayesian","low discernibility","single core","Xeon Processor","outputs","chest x-rays","Montgomery","solution","CXR images","infectious disease","death","training","softmax layer","paper","certain threshold","Shenzhen","main problem","Tuberculosis"],"language":"en"},

FLUAV has long been the cause of annual epidemics as well as less frequent but more severe global pandemics. Here, we describe a biosensor utilizing electrically active magnetic (EAM) polyaniline-coated nanoparticles as the transducer in an electrochemical biosensor for rapidly identifying FLUAV strains based on receptor specificity, which will be useful to monitor animal influenza infections and to characterize pandemic potential of strains that have transmitted from animals to humans. Pandemic potential requires human-to-human transmissibility, which is dependent upon FLUAV hemagglutinin (HA) specificity for host glycan receptors. Avian FLUAV preferentially bind to \u03B12,3-linked receptors, while human FLUAV bind to \u03B12,6-linked receptors. EAM nanoparticles were prepared by synthesizing aniline monomer around gamma iron (III) oxide (\u03B3-Fe(2)O(3)) cores, yielding 25\u2013100-nm diameter nanoparticles that were structurally characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The EAM nanoparticles were coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04). Specificity of binding between glycans and H5 was demonstrated. The biosensor results were correlative to supporting data from a surface plasmon resonance assay that characterized HA/glycan binding and \u03B1-H5 antibody activity. This novel study applies EAM nanoparticles as the transducer in a specific, portable, easy-to-use biosensor with great potential for disease monitoring and biosecurity applications.","publish_time":"2011-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamikawa, Tracy L.; Mikolajczyk, Malgorzata G.; Kennedy, Michael; Zhong, Lilin; Zhang, Pei; Setterington, Emma B.; Scott, Dorothy E.; Alocilja, Evangelyn C.","journal":"IEEE Trans Nanotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee7528ca0d596d83381f2dcedd7b72cfea2bb17e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176473.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FLUAV","EAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EAM nanoparticles","human FLUAV","FLUAV strains","FLUAV hemagglutinin","Avian FLUAV","pandemic potential of strains","polyaniline-coated nanoparticles","easy-to-use biosensor","Specificity of binding","electrochemical biosensor","biosensor results","linked receptors","nm diameter nanoparticles","HA","great potential","glycan binding","transducer","host glycan receptors","receptor specificity","human transmissibility","\u03B12","animal influenza infections","causative agent of influenza infection","electron diffraction","recent swine-origin H1N1 pandemic","monoclonal antibodies specific","transmission electron microscopy","\u03B1-H5 antibody activity","data","disease monitoring","surface plasmon resonance assay","extensive attention","gamma iron","biosecurity applications","aniline monomer","oxide","H5N1","\u03B3-Fe","novel study","severe global pandemics","cause of annual epidemics","glycans","virus","animals","Vietnam","humans","cores"],"language":"en"},

We present a heterogeneous mean-field theoretical approach to the coinfection dynamics on generic uncorrelated power-law degree-distributed networks and validate its results by means of numerical simulations. We show that, when the second moment of the degree distribution is finite, the epidemic transition is continuous for low cooperativity, while it is discontinuous when cooperativity is sufficiently high. For scale-free networks, i.e., topologies with diverging second moment, the transition is instead always continuous. In this way we clarify the effect of heterogeneity and system size on the nature of the transition, and we validate the physical interpretation about the origin of the discontinuity.","publish_time":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Peng-Bi; Colaiori, Francesca; Castellano, Claudio","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6eee0b67e9557224a8bdf49fa8006aa291b963a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discontinuous transition","epidemic transition","cooperative dynamics","cooperative pathogens","moment","susceptible-infected","coinfection dynamics","degree distribution","low cooperativity","infectious disease","generic uncorrelated power-law degree-distributed networks","scale-free networks","heterogeneous mean-field theoretical approach","crucial role","effect of heterogeneity","system size","violent outbreaks","type model","contact network","results","propagation","nature","topologies","diverging","origin","physical interpretation","cases","increased probability","endemic state","individual","discontinuity","numerical simulations","topology","way","spread"],"language":"en"},

In the susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary, the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to find a nonexponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Mi Jin; Lee, Deok-Sun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27610ddaadd7e4a1b5138d50bf2c235a8b479a1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cluster","cluster of infected nodes","mean size","cluster size","mean infection time","hub nodes","intermediate-time regime","susceptible-infected model","slow spreading","intermediate stage","heterogeneous networks","small-degree nodes","given number of nodes","algebraic spreading phase","temporal pattern","large fluctuation","broad distribution","large statistical fluctuations","complex systems","information","well-defined measures","boundary area","way","better measure","reliable prediction","scaling behaviors","structural heterogeneity","nonexponential","representative value","early exponential","variation","results"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that PSVPro ventilation mode would reduce consumption of anesthetic agents compared with pressure control ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Seventy children between three and eight years of age undergoing elective lower abdominal and urological surgery were randomized into PCV group (n = 35) or PSVPro group (n = 35). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and a Proseal LMA\u2122 was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion to maintain the entropy values between 40 and 60. In the PCV mode, the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain an expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL\u00B7kg(\u22121) and a respiratory rate of 12\u201320/min. In the PSVPRO group, the flow trigger was set at 0.4 L\u00B7min(\u22121) and pressure support was adjusted to obtain expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL\u00B7kg(\u22121). Consumption of anesthetic agent was recorded as the primary outcome. Emergence time and discharge time were recorded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The PSVPro group showed significant reduction in propofol consumption compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 33.3 \u00B5g(\u22121)\u00B7kg(\u22121)\u00B7min(\u22121); 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 42.2). There was decrease in the emergence time in the PSVPro group compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 3.5 min; 95% CI, 2.8 to 4.2) and in time to achieve modified Aldrete score \u003E 9 (mean difference, 3.6 min; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.2). CONCLUSION: The PSVPro mode decreases propofol consumption and emergence time, and improves oxygenation index in children undergoing ambulatory surgery.

The genome of birnaviruses encodes the highly immunogenic VP2 capsid protein. In order to demonstrate that the VP2 protein can be exploited as a diagnostic antigen for birnaviruses, we developed a lateral flow assay based on the surface-exposed VP2 protrusion domain of a representative birnavirus, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) of serotype 1 which causes the highly devastating infectious bursal disease in chickens. The biophysical characterization of the purified domain reveals that the domain predominantly consists of \u03B2-sheets, exists in a trimeric form, and remains folded at high temperatures, making it suitable for diagnostic purposes. Owing to its highly immunogenic nature and excellent biophysical properties, we employed the VP2 protrusion domain in a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for rapid detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of infected chickens. Our results indicate that the domain binds anti-IBDV antibodies with high specificity during laboratory testing and on-site testing. The lateral flow assay reported here yields comparable results in a qualitative manner as obtained through a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As VP2 is a common capsid protein of birnaviruses, the lateral flow assay can be generalized for other birnaviruses, and members of Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae families which contain homologous VP2 capsid proteins.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti-SARS therapy. There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase. To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS-CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain. The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes. We predict important structural attributes of potential anti-SARS-CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen-bonding capability for the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 groups of the sugar ring and C3\u2032 endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization.

During ICPIC 2015, held in Geneva in June 2015, a full one-day session focused on the 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. This article is a non-exhaustive compilation of these discussions. It concentrates on lessons learned and imagining a way forward for the communities most affected by the epidemic. The reader can access video recordings of all lectures delivered during this one-day session, as referenced. Topics include the timeline of the international response, linkages between the dynamics of the epidemic and infection prevention and control, the importance of community engagement, and updates on virology, diagnosis, treatment and vaccination issues. The paper also includes discussions from public health, infectious diseases, critical care and infection control experts who cared for patients with EVD in Africa, in Europe, and in the United Sates and were involved in Ebola preparedness in both high- and low-resource settings and countries. This review concludes that too little is known about the pathogenesis and treatment of EVD, therefore basic and applied research in this area are urgently required. Furthermore, it is clear that epidemic preparedness needs to improve globally, in particular through the strengthening of health systems at local and national levels. There is a strong need for culturally sensitive approaches to public health which could be designed and delivered by social scientists and medical professionals working together. As of December 2015, this epidemic killed more than 11,000 people and infected more than 28,000; it has also generated more than 17,000 survivors and orphans, many of whom face somatic and psychological complications. The continued treatment and rehabilitation of these people is a public health priority, which also requires an integration of specific medical and social science approaches, not always available in West Africa.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vetter, Pauline; Dayer, Julie-Anne; Schibler, Manuel; Allegranzi, Benedetta; Brown, Donal; Calmy, Alexandra; Christie, Derek; Eremin, Sergey; Hagon, Olivier; Henderson, David; Iten, Anne; Kelley, Edward; Marais, Frederick; Ndoye, Babacar; Pugin, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Robert-Nicoud, Hugues; Sterk, Esther; Tapper, Michael; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Kaiser, Laurent; Pittet, Didier","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/275dd71da13e09fcace07d5824ac14a2c38d1df1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4858848.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4858848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["Geneva","Africa","Europe","United Sates","Ebola","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["infection prevention","treatment of EVD","infection control experts","ICPIC","epidemic preparedness","public health priority","continued treatment","West Africa","strengthening of health systems","discussions","people","Ebola preparedness","day session","social science approaches","sensitive approaches","international response","International Consortium","social scientists","medical professionals","integration of specific medical","Ebola virus disease","critical care","infectious diseases","virology","updates","outbreak","various subjects","dynamics","importance of community engagement","diagnosis","linkages","biannual conference","patients","low-resource settings","non-exhaustive compilation","timeline","applied research","national levels","Europe","rehabilitation","United Sates","strong need","vaccination issues","video recordings","article","countries","area","lectures","paper","way","orphans","psychological complications","reader","Topics","communities","pathogenesis","lessons","survivors","Geneva","review"],"language":"en"},

Studies that have attempted to improve patient hand hygiene practice lack sustainability due to dependability on healthcare staff, and no prior studies have tested ways to improve independent patient hand hygiene practice. One such approach is using a patient-centered multi-modal educational intervention and electronic voice-recorded reminder cue to promote self- management of hand hygiene. METHODS: This comparative effectiveness study tested two educationally-based approaches to improve patient hand hygiene in older adults hospitalized for 4 days for elective lower extremity orthopedic or podiatry surgery at a veterans\u2019 hospital. Group 1 (n = 41) received an educational video, an educational handout and a voice-recorded electronic audio reminder (EAR) an active cue, which verbally reminded the participant to clean their hands 3 times a day (7am, 12 pm, 5pm). Group 2 (n = 34) received the educational video and handout without the EAR. There were no significant differences between the two randomly assigned groups in terms of age, ethnicity and sex. RESULTS: Figure 1 shows the daily difference in product consumption Day 0 to Day 3. The average product consumption of ABHR (alcohol-based hand rub) in Group 1 (EAR) was 29.97 grams (SD 17.13). Group 2 (No EAR) averaged 10.88 grams (9.27) (P \u003C 0.0001). Comparing post-operative day (POD) 0 to POD 3, and controlling for covariates (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH], Hand Grip Strength, Surgical Pain, MRSA in Nares, and Education), multivariate analyses indicated that the electronic audio reminder was a significant predictor (\u03B2=.468) of ABHR consumption, R(2) = .39, R(2)adj. = .34, F (6, 68) = 7.265, P \u003C .001. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a short educational intervention that included a video, a handout, and a verbal audio reminder has the potential to increase patient-centered infection prevention in the acute care settings without increasing the workload of healthcare workers. Findings can be used for future infection prevention studies in institutionalized patients to improve self-managed care.

Despite high coverage, influenza-like illnesses (ILI) remain a frequent cause of missed duty and hospitalizations, particularly in U.S. military recruits. More research is needed on the epidemiology and etiology of ILI to reduce the burden of respiratory infections in congregated military settings. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess ILI patterns among US Army recruits in a 9-week basic combat training course at Ft. Benning, GA. Demographic data, vaccination history, and information on recent illness were collected at enrollment in January 2017. Participants were divided into two platoons with staggered biweekly visit schedules. Visits occurred from reception through training, with nasal swabs and symptom surveys (all visits) and blood draws (weeks 8 and 9). Nasal specimens were used to detect clinical and colonizing pathogens using the Diatherix TEM-PCR Respiratory Panel. RESULTS: A total of 90 recruits were enrolled in the study. Twelve recruits were lost due to training attrition in the first week of the study. The participants were male and the mean age was 23 yo (SD 4.9). There were 10 (13%) cases of ILI reported among the 78 remaining participants, 6 in week 1, 3 in week 2 and 1 in week 9. The most frequently detected pathogens in the 10 symptomatic cases were coronavirus (5, 50%), rhinovirus (4, 40%), other enterovirus (3, 30%), and influenza A (2, 20%). Pathogen co-detections were common, 8 out 10 cases were associated with 2 pathogens, representing 7 unique combinations. While rhinovirus and coronavirus were most common among asymptomatic trainees, 10% had detectable influenza A. Detection of multiple pathogens was common in the first two weeks of training (50% among those who had viral detection). The study is still in progress. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic ILI was associated with coronavirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus, in addition to influenza in the early weeks of training. Coronavirus and rhinovirus also circulated widely among healthy recruits, along with influenza. The findings will inform ILI control strategies for congregated military trainees. DISCLOSURES: E.

Data on risk factors (RF) for LRI and mortality is lacking for HCoV infections after HCT. We aimed to validate our ISI in HCoV infections. METHODS: All adult HCT recipients with HCoV infection from 2015 to 2017 were evaluated. An ISI based on RF was used to classify patients as low (0\u20132), moderate (3\u20136), or high (7 or higher) risk for progression to LRI or death. We defined LRI as HCoV detected in nasal wash and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and new lung infiltrates on diagnostic imaging. Clinical parameters were collected and ISI were calculated for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 144 adult HCT recipients with 166 episodes of HCoV infections were analyzed. The most common HCoV serotype for LRI and URI was 229E (42.4%) and OC43 (37.6%), respectively, and most patients were infected between November and March each year (Figures 1 and 2). When compared with URI, patients with LRI were more likely in the pre-engraftment period, had multiple respiratory viruses infections, had nosocomially acquired HCoV, required hospitalization, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation (all, P \u003C 0.05). Overall mortality rate was 4% at Day 30 from diagnosis and all patients who died had LRI with an 18% mortality. Among those who died, 33% had nosocomial infection, 67% were co-infected with another respiratory virus and 67% required mechanical ventilation. Using an ISI cut off of \u003C4, the negative predictive value (NPV) for progression to LRI was 86% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: HCT recipients with HCoV LRI were more likely to have a fatal outcome. The NPV of the ISI for progression to LRI was high and could be used as a prognostic tool for future studies and for therapeutic clinical trials.

It is also associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Our previous results showed that the expression of antiviral genes in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells is downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 proteins. To understand the role of HCoV-OC43 proteins in antagonizing antiviral responses of the host, we investigated the effect of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins on the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) promoter, and nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-kappaB-RE). METHODS: HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector, followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Two days post-transfection, the cells were co-transfected with a reporter vector containing firefly luciferase under the control of ISRE, IFN-\u03B2 promoter, or NF-kappaB-RE. Renilla luciferase vector was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Following 24 hours of incubation, the cells were treated with either IFN or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for 6 hours. Thereafter, promoter activity was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Influenza NS1 protein was used as positive control for antagonism. RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03B2 promoter, and NF-kappaB-RE was downregulated in the presence of ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein as there was a sharp fall in firefly luciferase levels. Overall, HCoV-OC43 proteins reduced firefly luciferase levels for ISRE and IFN-\u03B2 promoter by at least ten fold, whereas for NF-kappaB-RE the firefly luciferase levels were reduced by at least fivefold. CONCLUSION: HCoV-OC43 has the ability to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

BioFire\u00AE Filmarray\u00AE Pneumonia Panel: A Powerful Rapid Diagnostic Test for Antimicrobial Stewardship","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.1682","pmcid":"PMC6808661","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: BioFire\u00AE Filmarray\u00AE Pneumonia Panel (BFPP) is a multiplex PCR panel that identifies 33 common bacterial and viral pathogens seen in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonias. It rapidly identifies these pathogens in addition to 7 antibiotic resistance genes on sputum and bronchioalveolar lavage samples in 1 hour. As one of the test centers for this panel, our institution utilized this panel for clinical and laboratory use. We reviewed the impact of BFPP on antimicrobial stewardship, particularly its role in early discontinuation of empiric antibiotics and prompt initiation of optimized targeted therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases by which BFPP was ordered. We reviewed medical records of each case to identify the results of the panel, culture data, antibiotics used, and subsequent clinical intervention. RESULTS: 43 tests were ordered in total. 17 were for clinical use by an infectious disease specialist and 26 were randomly obtained by the microbiology lab. All 17 clinical cases were intervened upon with the following interventions: discontinuation of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (8 cases), discontinuation of anti-MRSA antibiotics (5 cases), discontinuation of azithromycin (4 cases), discontinuation of carbapenem (1 case), prevention of inappropriate antibiotic escalation or initiation of inappropriate antibiotics (2 cases), and early IV to PO transition (3 cases). Of the random 26 samples ordered by lab, 13 had opportunities for antibiotic de-escalation if a physician were notified of the results. Viruses were identified in 15 samples with coronavirus being the most common. Virus was the sole pathogen in 9 of the 15 samples. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 20 samples that were reported as normal flora by conventional culture; none of these cases led to or potentially could have led to antibiotic escalation as the sole intervention. CONCLUSION: Clinical use of BFPP had 100% intervention rate with all interventions leading to de-escalation of antibiotics or prevention of inappropriate antibiotics use. Though over-identification of colonizers is a potential limitation, BFPP is a powerful tool for antibiotic stewardship that results in rapid interventions to achieve optimal targeted therapy.

Implementation of Electronic Travel History Screening at an Urban Medical Center","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.1539","pmcid":"PMC6809912","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a novel coronavirus, can lead to severe respiratory failure and death. CDC recommends screening patients who traveled to endemic countries for fever, respiratory symptoms, and exposure to MERS-positive contacts and healthcare facilities. UCLA is a large, academic, medical center located in a diverse city with frequent international travel. We implemented a travel screening (TS) questionnaire in our electronic medical record (EMR) (Figure 1) to identify high-risk patients in order to implement early isolation practices and testing. This study describes the use and performance of our TS for identifying suspect MERS cases. METHODS: An EMR-based tool prompts nurses to ask patients at triage or admission whether they have traveled out of the country in the past 30 days (Figure 1). If patients answer affirmatively, the EMR prompts nurses to inquire about travel to specific high-risk countries and to review symptoms and exposure risks. Upon notification of a potential MERS case, the EID physician on-call reviews the TS, clinical history, epidemiologic risks, and makes a determination whether further evaluation and/or isolation for suspect MERS is necessary. We reviewed travel history, demographics, and symptoms of patients who triggered a positive TS from April 2017 to September 2018. RESULTS: The ED completed 115,815 distinct TS on 81,197 individuals during this time period. The median time from ED arrival to TS completion was 6.4 minutes. 308 ED encounters triggered a positive TS; an additional 257 encounters in other units triggered a positive TS, resulting in 565 positive TS (Table 1). 122 (22%) expressed \u22651 MERS symptom and 29 (24%) expressed both fever and respiratory symptoms. Of these symptomatic patients, 0 had a history of contact with a MERS case; 3 had a history of contact with a healthcare facility while traveling; and 4 had a history of contact with camels. No patients were diagnosed with MERS (Table 2). CONCLUSION: A history of travel to the MERS endemic countries is relatively common at a large urban hospital. Routine electronic screening of patients is an efficient way to identify high-risk travelers. This EMR tool could be modified for other emerging pathogens, such as measles or Ebola, to identify high-risk patients.

Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the effects of coinfection on disease severity or healthcare seeking are less well-understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in rural southern Nepal. Prospective weekly active household-based surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RT\u2013PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses simultaneously detected as part of the same illness episode. Maternal vaccination status, infant age, prematurity, and number of children under 5 in the household were adjusted for with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected on their primary illness episode. Coinfection status did not differ by maternal vaccination status, infant age, premature birth, and number of children under 5 in the household. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. Overall, infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting 4 or more days overall (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and in the subset of infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7). Coinfection was not associated with seeking further care (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5) or pneumonia (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of infants experiencing their first respiratory illness had multiple viruses detected. Coinfection with influenza was associated with longer duration of fever compared with children with influenza alone, but was not associated with increased illness severity by other measures.

METHODS: The study was organized in three phases: an environmental scan to describe current research activity in BC; a consultation to identify needs, gaps and opportunities with those conducting research (key informants) and the end users of research results (stakeholders); and a prioritization of the research needs emerging from the consultation. RESULTS: Analysis and synthesis of the consultation data resulted in the identification of nine research themes, which were prioritized in the following order: efficacy and cost-benefit, disease patterns, emerging infectious disease, immunology and vaccines, disease-specific research, health promotion and communications, safe food and water, knowledge translation research and genomics. Six capacity-building themes were also identified: attraction and retention, education and training, collaboration and networks, funding, dissemination of findings, and public health input, surveillance, informatics and databases. INTERPRETATION: The findings were helpful in developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level infectious disease research agenda linking researchers in universities, hospitals and public health institutions with practitioners and policy-makers in British Columbia\u2019s public health system.

Respiratory viral infections are frequently followed by mycoplasmal and secondary bacterial invasion of the lower respiratory tract, which increases the extent and severity oflung damage. Bad housing, particularly bad ventilation, will increase the severity of pneumonia outbreaks. Although the source of respiratory viral infections is not always obvious, it is likely that a proportion of calves acquire infection from their dams early in life. The possibility of cross-infections from other domestic animals and from humans must also be considered. Diagnosis of respiratory virus infections necessitates submission of suitable respiratory tract specimens that are taken at an early stage in the outbreak together with paired sera.

Its antiparasitic effect is that of a schizontocide and is explained by rapid uptake by parasitized erythrocytes and interaction with a component of hemoglobin degradation resulting in formation of free radicals. It has been shown to exhibit a high clinical cure rate. Previous animal safety studies with Qinghaosu derivatives revealed dose-dependent neurotoxicity with movement disturbances and neuropathic changes in the hindbrain of intramuscularly treated dogs, rats and monkeys. Such effects have not been seen in man. The objective of our present studies was to compare the effects of high levels of AM administered to dogs p.o. versus i.m. In a pilot study 20 mg/kg/day of AM was given i.m. to groups of 3 male Beagle dogs for 5 and 30 days, respectively. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were noted in some individual dogs from test day 23 on. One dog had to be sacrificed pre-term. Hematologic findings indicated a hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Microscopic examination demonstrated neuropathic changes only at 30 days, but not at 5 days. The animals had neuronal and secondary axonal damage, most prominent in the cerebellar roof, pontine and vestibular nuclei, and in the raphe/paralemniscal region. The affected neurons showed loss of Nissl substance, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, shrinkage of the nucleus and in advanced stages scavenging by microglia. In a subsequent experiment, AM was administered to groups of 4 male and 4 female dogs, respectively, at 8 daily doses of 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg i.m., or 0, 50, 150 and 600 mg/kg p.o. Neurologic signs were seen at high i.m. doses only. In most animals they were inconspicuous and consisted of reduced activity with convulsions seen in single dogs shortly before death. Neuronal damage occurred in all animals at 40 and 80 mg/kg following i.m. treatment. At 20 mg/kg minimal effects occurred in 5/8 dogs only, indicating that this level was close to tolerated exposure. No comparable lesions were observed after oral administration. Both i.m. and p.o. exposure at high dose levels was associated with a prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG, suggesting slowing of repolarization of the myocardium. Individual data indicated that in 1 of 4 females at 80 mg/kg i.m. this prolongation was above the 25 % level considered as threshold for concern. After intramuscular administration pharmacokinetics indicated peak plasma levels of AM at 2 to 4 hours post-dose, slow elimination and a tendency to accumulate after repeated administration. Only low levels of the major metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were found. AM levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were \u003C 10 % of plasma levels. After oral administration AM concentrations were considerably lower than after i.m. administration. The concentration of DHA was high on day 1 but almost nil on day 7 indicating its fast inactivation in dogs. Two hours after the 8(th) oral administration neither AM nor DHA was detected in CSF which may explain the absence of neurotoxicity in dogs after oral administration of AM.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Classen, W.; Altmann, B.; Gretener, P.; Souppart, C.; Skelton-Stroud, P.; Krinke, G.","journal":"Exp Toxicol Pathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Artemether"],"organizations":["Qinghaosu","DHA","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual dogs","oral administration of","single dogs","treated dogs","female dogs","high dose levels","effects of high levels","male Beagle dogs","low levels","peak plasma levels","intramuscular administration pharmacokinetics","animals","days","test day","dose-dependent neurotoxicity","Clinical signs of neurotoxicity","high clinical cure rate","neuropathic changes","absence of neurotoxicity","hours post-dose","Neuronal damage","groups","concentration of DHA","CSF","exposure","minimal effects","Qinghaosu derivatives","present studies","Neurologic signs","Individual data","daily doses","secondary axonal damage","Previous animal safety studies","prolongation of mean QT interval of ECG","interaction","loss of Nissl substance","movement disturbances","shrinkage","cytoplasmic eosinophilia","hindbrain","component of hemoglobin degradation","cerebellar roof","herb Artemisia annua","nucleus","vestibular nuclei","rapid uptake","parasitized erythrocytes","extract","slow elimination","major metabolite","reduced activity","raphe","schizontocide","sweet wormwood","formation of free radicals","affected neurons","convulsions","rats","dihydroartemisinin","tendency","Hematologic findings","microcytic anemia","advanced stages","antimalarial drug","fast inactivation","Microscopic examination","monkeys","cerebrospinal fluid","comparable lesions","concentrations","pre-term","antiparasitic effect","paralemniscal region","repolarization","microglia","threshold","concern","objective","pilot study","death","subsequent experiment","myocardium","Artemether","man","treatment","females"],"language":"en"},

Despite important advances in prevention through vaccines, new rapid diagnostic tests and antibiotics, CAP management still has significant drawbacks. Mortality remains very high in severely ill patients presenting with respiratory failure or shock but is also high in the elderly. Even after a CAP episode, higher risk of death remains during a long period, a risk mainly driven by inflammation and patient-related co-morbidities. CAP microbiology has been altered by new molecular diagnostic tests that have turned viruses into the most identified pathogens, notwithstanding uncertainties about the specific role of each virus in CAP pathogenesis. Pneumococcal vaccines also impacted CAP etiology and thus had changed Streptococcus pneumoniae circulating serotypes. Pathogens from specific regions should also be kept in mind when treating CAP. New antibiotics for CAP treatment were not tested in severely ill patients and focused on multidrug-resistant pathogens that are unrelated to CAP, limiting their general use and indications for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Similarly, CAP management could be personalized through the use of adjunctive therapies that showed outcome improvements in particular patient groups. Although pneumococcal vaccination was only convincingly shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease, with a less significant effect in pneumococcal CAP, it remains the best therapeutic intervention to prevent bacterial CAP. Further research in CAP is needed to reduce its population impact and improve individual outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferreira-Coimbra, Jo\u00E3o; Sarda, Cristina; Rello, Jordi","journal":"Adv Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baed636bd5e7f6484534be677cb61ac8027e94fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140754.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140754/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal CAP","CAP management","CAP etiology","CAP episode","CAP treatment","CAP pathogenesis","CAP microbiology","Pneumococcal vaccines","New antibiotics","ill patients","pneumococcal vaccination","new rapid diagnostic tests","new molecular diagnostic tests","identified pathogens","invasive pneumococcal disease","higher risk of death","multidrug-resistant pathogens","general use","important advances","significant effect","specific role","significant drawbacks","specific regions","important health problem","leading cause of death","use of adjunctive therapies","particular patient groups","patient-related co-morbidities","infectious diseases","intensive care unit","outcome improvements","considerable implications","indications","prevention","inflammation","viruses","respiratory failure","best therapeutic intervention","uncertainties","shock","healthcare systems","population impact","Streptococcus pneumoniae","long period","individual outcomes","mind","research","serotypes","Mortality","Community","elderly"],"language":"en"},

The mechanical oscillations that occur during breathing have profound effects on airway tone and airway responsiveness both in experimental animals and humans in vivo and in isolated airway tissues in vitro. Experimental evidence suggests that alterations in the contractile and mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle tissues caused by mechanical perturbations result from adaptive changes in the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture of the smooth muscle cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes rapid reorganization in response to external mechanical and pharmacologic stimuli. Contractile stimulation initiates the assembly of cytoskeletal/extracellular matrix adhesion complex proteins into large macromolecular signaling complexes (adhesomes) that undergo activation to mediate the polymerization and reorganization of a submembranous network of actin filaments at the cortex of the cell. Cortical actin polymerization is catalyzed by Neuronal-Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex, which are activated by pathways regulated by paxillin and the small GTPase, cdc42. These processes create a strong and rigid cytoskeletal framework that may serve to strengthen the membrane for the transmission of force generated by the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix, and to enable the adaptation of smooth muscle cells to mechanical stresses. This model for the regulation of airway smooth muscle function can provide novel perspectives to explain the normal physiologic behavior of the airways and pathophysiologic properties of the airways in asthma.","publish_time":"2019-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wenwu; Gunst, Susan J.","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbbc407d34a99f3b4d5ba9344f3f5da65471b7a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Contractile"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle tissues","external mechanical","mechanical perturbations","mechanical stresses","mechanical oscillations","mechanical forces","regulation of airway smooth muscle function","airway responsiveness","airway tone","adaptation of smooth muscle cells","airways","isolated airway tissues","assembly of cytoskeletal","cytoskeletal architecture","contractile apparatus","normal breathing","Contractile stimulation","rigid cytoskeletal framework","Cortical actin polymerization","extracellular matrix adhesion complex proteins","pathophysiologic properties","rapid reorganization","experimental animals","Experimental evidence","normal physiologic behavior","submembranous network of actin filaments","response","novel perspectives","Neuronal-Wiskott","Aldrich syndrome protein","complexes","humans","profound effects","N-WASP","alterations","dynamic structure","adaptive changes","paxillin","adhesomes","cortex","activation","pharmacologic stimuli","small GTPase","transmission of force","cdc42","pathways","Arp2","processes","asthma","model","membrane","cytoskeleton"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the effects of extracts of Broussonetia papyrifera root bark (PRE) and its bioactive components on inflammation and insulin sensitivity. PRE inhibited TNF-\u03B1-induced NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity in the NF-\u03BAB luciferase assay and pro-inflammatory genes\u2019 expression by blocking phosphorylation of I\u03BAB and NF-\u03BAB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were mediated by activating AMPK. Ten-week-high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL6 male mice treated with PRE had improved glucose intolerance and decreased inflammation in adipose tissue, as indicated by reductions in NF-\u03BAB phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory genes\u2019 expression. Furthermore, PRE activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced lipogenic genes\u2019 expression in both adipose tissue and liver. Finally, we identified broussoflavonol B (BF) and kazinol J (KJ) as bioactive constituents to suppress pro-inflammatory responses via activating AMPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results indicate the therapeutic potential of PRE, especially BF or KJ, in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jae Min; Choi, Sun Sil; Park, Mi Hyeon; Jang, Hyunduk; Lee, Yo Han; Khim, Keon Woo; Oh, Sei Ryang; Park, Jiyoung; Ryu, Hyung Won; Choi, Jang Hyun","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd61f81477f828db66138705a44bd0ce2ae24751.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRE","AMPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB phosphorylation","pro-inflammatory genes\u2019 expression","adipose tissue","NF-\u03BAB luciferase assay","activating AMPK","induced NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity","pro-inflammatory responses","therapeutic potential of PRE","reduced lipogenic genes\u2019 expression","BF","decreased inflammation","PRE inhibited TNF-\u03B1","KJ","3T3-L1 adipocytes","obesity-induced insulin resistance","chronic low-grade inflammation","phosphorylation of I\u03BAB","bioactive constituents","bioactive components","insulin sensitivity","AMP-activated protein kinase","HFD","improved glucose intolerance","causal role","Broussonetia papyrifera root bark","kazinol J","C57BL6 male mice","effects of extracts","metabolic diseases","reductions","associated pathophysiological consequences","week-high fat diet","type","broussoflavonol B","results","liver","diabetes","study"],"language":"en"},

Research on how to establish covert communication channel over the above popular public applications has been flourishing in recent years. This paper tries to present a novel and effective method to construct a covert channel over common compressed speech stream by embedding sense information into it. In our method, after analysing the characteristic features of the excitation pulse positions of the ITU-T G.723.1 and G.729A speech codec, we design a novel and effective covert communication channel by finely modulating the codes of excitation pulse positions of the above two codecs in line with the secret information to be hidden. To improve the embedding capacity of the proposed method, we also use all the odd/even characteristics of pulse code positions to conduct information hiding. To test and verify the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on several different scenarios. Experimental results show that our methods and algorithms perform a higher degree of secrecy and sound information embedding efficacy compared with exiting similar methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Fufang; Li, Binbin; Huang, Yongfeng; Feng, Yuanyong; Peng, Lingxi; Zhou, Naqin","journal":"Neural Comput Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c826edc7484fd9ee2bf3d12923fd7870a1cb521a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153697.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["covert channel","effective covert communication channel","sound information","sense information","secret information","effective method","proposed method","codes of excitation pulse positions","characteristics of pulse code positions","novel","embedding capacity","speech codec","proposed approach","exiting similar methods","common compressed speech stream","higher degree of secrecy","efficacy","algorithms","popular public applications","codecs","characteristic features","experiments","ITU-T","VoIP","line","recent years","Experimental results","mobile communications","different scenarios","Research","multimedia","paper"],"language":"en"},

Here, we assessed spinal cord autoregulation under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions compared with cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: Ten pigs (36.1 \u00B1 1.1 kg) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, before phenylephrine administration at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 \u03BCg kg(\u22121) min(\u22121) in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals (baseline), followed by similar administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship \u003C 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum. Paradoxical responses (an inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation to MAP) were observed particularly in cerebrum during phenylephrine infusion and were rare in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord autoregulation is less robust than cerebral autoregulation and more pressure-dependent. Similar to cerebral oxygenation, spinal cord oxygenation is volume-tolerant but is more sensitive to hypotension.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurita, Tadayoshi; Kawashima, Shingo; Morita, Koji; Nakajima, Yoshiki","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a4265a664428e83fc2e3e0dce663facf47d0345.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158138/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","TOI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spinal cord oxygenation","spinal cord autoregulation","cerebral oxygenation","cerebral autoregulation","lumbar spinal cord TOIs","cerebral TOI","lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices","phenylephrine administration","phenylephrine infusion","inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation","blood pressure","Individual oxygenation responses","pressure-passive","pressure-dependent","average relationship","mean arterial pressure","similar MAPs","SNP","cerebrum","bleed","Hypovolemia","similar administration of sodium nitroprusside","subsequent fluid resuscitation","total blood volume","post-fluid resuscitation conditions","volume-tolerant","Paradoxical responses","autoregulatory pattern","negative correlations","infrared spectroscopy","relationships","RESULTS","studies","intervals","baseline","CONCLUSIONS","hydroxyethyl starch","stepwise fashion","hypotension","NIRS","BACKGROUND","isoflurane","METHODS","pigs","protocol","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

The respiratory system consists of an air conduction portion and a respiratory portion. The direct initiating factor of the common cold is low temperature, especially relative coldness. When people feel cold or chilly, vascular constriction around the inlet area of air occurs, resulting in a reduction of mucus secretion containing various antiviral soluble mediators and followed by an explosive increase in the nasal viral flora. A relatively low temperature and dryness are good conditions for viral proliferation and invasion to the body. The first symptom of the common cold is usually a runny nose, followed by a sore throat and/or systemic fever. Acute symptoms of the common cold are usually terminated within 3 days, at the longest 5~7 days. The mortality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has reached around 10%. A novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus caused the occurrence of more than 130,000 patients and dead cases of more than 800 people. H5N1 avian influenza showed an extremely high mortality rate, even though its infectivity is low. A new serotype of AI (H7N9) has appeared in some areas of China. Vitamin C can prevent the onset of a cold. Vitamin C can even prevent influenza virus from spreading down from the upper respiratory tract to the lower one. In addition, levels of interferon (IFN) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are markedly low in vitamin C-insufficient mice. Inflammatory cells are markedly increased in BAL fluid, providing the immunological evidences that daily supplementation of high-dose vitamin C can prevent influenza infection and that, in extreme case, it can save the life.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Wang Jae","journal":"Vitamin C in Human Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9f24fe05e2b32cc0dbda158364943b2f15b952d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122289.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["common cold","dose vitamin C","low temperature","influenza virus","respiratory portion","influenza infection","respiratory system","vitamin C-insufficient mice","high mortality rate","BAL fluid","mortality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome","H5N1 avian influenza","upper respiratory tract","people","days","novel swine-origin influenza","air conduction portion","viral proliferation","Acute symptoms","daily supplementation of high","inlet area of air","nasal viral flora","good conditions","various antiviral soluble mediators","immunological evidences","vascular constriction","dryness","reduction of mucus secretion","explosive increase","IFN","invasion","H1N1","sore throat","bronchoalveolar lavage","runny nose","direct initiating factor","H7N9","SARS","levels of interferon","relative coldness","causative agents","patients","new serotype of AI","addition","systemic fever","extreme case","dead cases","occurrence","body","infectivity","viruses","onset","Inflammatory cells","areas of China"],"language":"en"},

We begin by introducing the subject and describing the primary aspects of the current cybersecurity environment. We define fundamental terminology and concepts used in the cybersecurity community, and we describe the basic steps to include cybersecurity risk in an overall risk management process, which is a central SE responsibility. We then list some of the primary sources of information, guidance, and standards upon which a systems engineer can and should draw. Next, we summarize the major aspects of incorporating security controls in a system architecture and design to achieve an acceptable level of security risk for a system. We extend this to the increasingly important world of service-oriented, network-based, and distributed systems. We conclude with a brief presentation of the application of MBSAP to the specific issues of cybersecurity and summarize the characteristics of a Secure Software Development Life Cycle aimed at creating software with minimum flaws and vulnerabilities. We illustrate the application of cybersecurity principles and practices using the Smart Microgrid example. Chapter Objective: the reader will be able to apply the MBSAP methodology to systems and enterprises that require protection of sensitive data and processes against the growing cybersecurity threat and to work effectively with cybersecurity specialists to achieve effective secure system solutions.","publish_time":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borky, John M.; Bradley, Thomas H.","journal":"Effective Model-Based Systems Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8a9f44c6dee6e9fbf2c8064515f7e66a4ff887a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Smart Microgrid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cybersecurity risk","incorporation of cybersecurity","cybersecurity specialists","cybersecurity community","application of cybersecurity principles","growing cybersecurity threat","specific issues of cybersecurity","current cybersecurity environment","system architecture","effective secure system solutions","security controls","acceptable level of security risk","security features","security experts","application of MBSAP","primary aspects","reader","systems engineer","distributed systems","overall risk management process","MBSE process","effective interaction","MBSAP methodology","level of understanding","major aspects","evolving subject","Chapter Objective","Secure Software Development Life Cycle","primary sources of information","enterprises","practices","processes","functions","characteristics","protection of sensitive data","network","design","ability","integral elements","Smart Microgrid example","guidance","standards","concepts","goal","important world of service","minimum flaws","basic steps","central SE responsibility","complex","vulnerabilities","brief presentation","fundamental terminology"],"language":"en"},

Agriculture and local food production is much influenced by water availability for irrigation. Water shortages are most severe in the Gulf countries which rely on aquifers, desalination, and recycled waste water for most of their water supplies. This means that most food is imported which is expensive if not subsidized through petrodollars. This impacts food security which is a particular concern in countries under conflict, particularly, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in this region from Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, parasites, and more rarely from Aeromonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reports indicate that children are the most susceptible and that many isolates are multidrug resistant. Chemical contamination of water supplies and crops are probably more of a concern than published reports indicate, because of widespread indiscriminate use of fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides, coupled with increased industrial pollution affecting the water supplies. Like many other parts of the developing world, foodborne disease surveillance is limited and outbreaks are most often reported through the Press but with insufficient detail to determine the etiological agents and the factors contributing to the outbreaks, leading to speculation to the cause by those interested or responsible for food prevention and control. However, there are some well investigated outbreaks in the region that have those details, and reveal where the shortcomings of both the establishments and the inspection systems have been. Where the causative agents are known, the kinds of pathogens are generally similar to those found in the West, e.g., Salmonella, but many outbreaks seem to have short incubation periods that point to a toxin of some kind of chemical or biological origin, but these are almost never identified. Because of sectarian warfare, residents and refugees have been given food that has made them sick and solders? have been deliberately poisoned. Research has been focused on microbial contamination of locally-sold foodstuffs and manager and employee knowledge of food safety and hygienic conditions in food preparation establishments. An innovative pilot project in Qatar is to use seawater and sunlight for raising crops through the Sahara Forest Project. All countries have some kind of food establishment inspection system, but they tend to be punitive if faults are found in management or employees on the premises rather than being used for their education for improving food safety. Restaurants may be closed down and owners and employees fined for often unspecified infringements. However, some food control agents are moving towards employee training through seminars and courses before problems occur, which is a good disease prevention strategy. Unfortunately, many of the food handlers are from Asian countries with languages other than Arabic and English, which makes effective food safety communication and training difficult. Tourists visiting popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt have suffered from foodborne illnesses, usually of unknown origin but poor hygienic conditions are blamed with law suits following, and the adverse publicity affects the long-term viability of some of these resorts. Food exports, important for local economies, have occasionally been contaminated resulting in recalls and sometimes illnesses and deaths, notably fenugreek seeds from Egypt (E. coli O104:H4), pomegranate arils from Turkey (hepatitis A virus), and tahini from Lebanon (Salmonella). Overall, in recent decades, the Middle East has made strides towards improving food safety for both residents and foreign visitors or ex-pat workers. However, within the countries there are large discrepancies in the extent of effective public health oversight including food safety and food security. Currently, almost all of the countries are involved to a greater or lesser extent in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, or are affected through political tensions and strife in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Turkey. In addition, the current overproduction of oil on a world-wide scale has led to a rapid decrease in revenues to most Gulf states. All this points to a severe setback, and an uncertain foreseeable future for improvements in obtaining both sufficient and safe food for residents in this region.","publish_time":"2016-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todd, Ewen C.

Surprisingly every day risk is different from the generally expected potential risk according to traditional ranking of hazards (zoonoses) in dogs in general. Attention is given to human behavior regarding the family dog and responsible dog ownership. Modern trends include pet travel or pet import from endemic to non-endemic areas, without sufficient knowledge amongst pet owners or public health institutes. Of great value is information provided by ESCCAP (www.esccap.org) with information for European countries (veterinarians and pet-owners) on prevalences and prevention of parasitic infections in dogs and cats in the major languages of Europe. Eventually attention is paid to new trends in dog feed such as feeding bones and raw meat. This may have serious consequences for the spread of ordinary zoonoses like Salmonella and parasitic infections not only between dogs, but also to family members. A last point of attention is the prevention of attracting wild life zoonoses via dogs to family members (eg. Echinococcus multilocularis and Baylisascaris spp.). Authorities responsible for public health should be encouraged to pay more attention, not only in providing more regulations, but primary in enforcement of existing rules and stimulating responsible pet-ownership.

For example, leukocytes can be collected from the circulation, counted, and their function accessed in cell culture. To test the ability of the immune system to respond to an experimental challenge more directly, studies involving wound healing, or involving the response to an infectious agent, can be performed. The purpose of this chapter is briefly to describe immune assays that are commonly employed in behavioral medicine research, including a rationale for their use as well as a brief description of the methodology.

Patients with acute rejection might be asymptomatic or present with symptoms that are not specific and can be also seen in other conditions. Clinical tests such as pulmonary function tests and imaging studies among others usually are abnormal; however, their results are also not specific for acute rejection. Histopathologic features of acute rejection in adequate samples of transbronchial lung biopsy of the lung allograft are currently the gold standard to assess for acute rejection in lung transplant recipients. Acute alloreactive injury can affect both the vasculature and the airways. Currently, the guidelines of the 2007 International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus conference are recommended for the histopathologic assessment of rejection. There are no specific morphologic features recognized to diagnose antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in lung allografts. Therefore, the diagnosis of AMR currently requires a \u201Ctriple test\u201D including clinical features, serologic evidence of donor-specific antibodies, and pathologic findings supportive of AMR. Complement 4d deposition is used to support a diagnosis of AMR in many solid organ transplants; however, its significance for the diagnosis of AMR in lung allografts is not entirely clear. This chapter discusses the currently recommended guidelines for the assessment of cellular rejection of lung allografts and summarizes our knowledge about morphologic features and immunophenotypic tests that might help in the diagnosis of AMR.","publish_time":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roden, Anja C.; Tazelaar, Henry D.","journal":"Lung Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a8245f0d44a66cb43d2258a6a5284b8c1161d85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122533/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Histopathologic features of acute rejection","diagnosis of AMR","assessment of cellular rejection of lung allografts","histopathologic assessment of rejection","lung allograft recipients","lung transplant recipients","antibody-mediated rejection","clinical features","specific morphologic features","clinical manifestation of chronic airway rejection","Clinical tests","Lung Transplantation consensus conference","Acute alloreactive injury","specific antibodies","adequate samples of transbronchial lung biopsy","pathologic findings supportive of AMR","immunophenotypic tests","recommended guidelines","pulmonary function tests","bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","important risk factor","serologic evidence of donor","knowledge","International Society of Heart","imaging studies","gold standard","triple test","solid organ transplants","significance","vasculature","symptoms","results","Patients","chapter","d deposition","airways","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Zoals voor veel inwendige aandoeningen geldt, is een goede anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek onontbeerlijk bij de analyse van pulmonale aandoeningen. De eerste paragrafen van dit hoofdstuk zullen hier dieper op ingaan. Helaas zijn de klachten vaak weinig specifiek en noodzaken dikwijls tot verder beeldvormend onderzoek. De X-thorax is vaak het beginpunt van een dergelijk diagnostisch traject. In de latere paragrafen zullen specifieke bevindingen op de X-thorax verder worden uitgediept. In veel gevallen is naast laboratoriumonderzoek ook functieonderzoek en computertomografie van de thorax noodzakelijk om de differenti\u00EBle diagnose verder te versmallen. Het verkrijgen van weefsel is bij interstiti\u00EBle longaandoeningen, tuberculose en maligniteit vaak het sluitstuk van de diagnostiek. Nieuwe endoscopische echogeleide technieken komen steeds meer in de plaats van invasief onderzoek zoals mediastinoscopie of thoracotomie. Ook kan met behulp van PCR-technieken sneller en meer specifiek een juiste diagnose worden verkregen.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braunstahl, G. J.; in \u2019t Veen, J. C. C.

The infection is usually caused by viruses including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Influenza is the only viral infection preventable by vaccination and occurs predominately during annual winter epidemics. Bacterial infection such as acute rhinopharyngitis is uncommon and usually presents with either persistent symptoms of an URTI lasting over a week or worsening course after initial improvement or acute onset with high fever and inflammatory changes confined to the pharynx. Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli, cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated. Fever in CNS infection is the most common presenting symptom in children beyond the neonatal age owing to the presence of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF in the blood or within the CNS. In MCD, fever was the first symptom in children younger than 5 years and 94% developed fever at some point. Viral exanthems are common causes of febrile illness in children. More than 50 viral agents are known to cause a rash. Historically, exanthems were numbered in the order in which they were differentiated from other exanthems. Thus the first was measles; second, scarlet fever; third, rubella; forth, so-called Filatov-Dukes disease (no longer recognized as an entity); fifth, erythema infectiosum; and sixth, exanthema subitum. As more exanthems were described, numerical assignment became impractical.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Radhi, A.

People caught in the wake of a disaster are rendered vulnerable by a variety of factors, including injuries, fear, grief, inadequate food and water, loss of housing, and disease outbreaks that sometimes accompany disasters. In addition, an entire population or segments of the population may have been vulnerable to some extent before the disaster struck: they may have food insecurity, lack of potable water, inadequate health care, or be at risk from endemic diseases. Therefore, many people are rendered doubly or even triply vulnerable in the wake of a disaster.

Microbial indoor exposure is a broader concept than microbial growth in buildings. Other sources of indoor microbial exposure include the outdoor environment, humans (crowdedness) and furry pet keeping. Microbial exposure can have different health effects depending on the dose, different exposure route, genetic disposition and the timing of exposure. Microbial stimulation linked to large microbial diversity in early life can protect against disease development, especially for allergic asthma and atopy. Protective effects are more often reported for bacterial exposure and adverse health effects are more often linked to mould exposure. There are many studies on health associations for indoor exposure to endotoxin, mainly from homes. The risk of getting atopic asthma may be less if you are exposed to endotoxin in childhood but the risk of non-atopic asthma may increase if exposed to endotoxin especially in adulthood. Moreover, genetic disposition modifies health effects of endotoxin. Epidemiological studies on muramic acid (from gram-positive bacteria) or ergosterol (from mould) are few. Studies on health effects of indoor exposure to beta-1-3-glucan (from mould) have conflicting results (positive as well as negative associations). Epidemiological studies on health effects of indoor exposure to mycotoxins are very few. Some studies have reported health associations for MVOC, but it is unclear to what extent MVOC has microbial sources in indoor environments. Many studies have reported health associations for fungal DNA, especially as a risk factor for childhood asthma at home. Since most studies on health effects of indoor exposure to mould, bacteria and microbial agents are cross-sectional, it is difficult to draw conclusions on causality. More prospective studies on indoor microbial exposure are needed and studies should include other indoor environments than homes, such as day care centers, schools, hospitals and offices.","publish_time":"2019-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Norb\u00E4ck, Dan; Cai, Gui-Hong","journal":"Indoor Environmental Quality and Health Risk toward Healthier Environment for All","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21ff7ff541d3cf104a3e039ef57cf69429f045ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Microbial indoor exposure","health effects of indoor exposure","sources of indoor microbial exposure","mould exposure","indoor mould","health effects of endotoxin","health associations","different health effects","bacterial exposure","timing of exposure","indoor environments","microbial sources","microbial growth","Microbial stimulation","Epidemiological studies","observed adverse health effects","different exposure route","prospective studies","risk of asthma","Protective effects","types of microbial agents","large microbial diversity","childhood asthma","risk of non-atopic asthma","allergic asthma","risk factor","negative associations","genetic disposition","buildings","homes","gram-positive bacteria","extent MVOC","dose","broader concept","early life","humans","rhinitis","bronchitis","outdoor environment","day care centers","schools","hospitals","crowdedness","disease development","muramic acid","fungal DNA","beta","respiratory tract infections","conflicting results","mycotoxins","international consensus","furry pet","offices","glucan","ergosterol","conclusions","causality","atopy","adulthood"],"language":"en"},

Here we review studies on specific age-related changes in B cell generation, activation, and maintenance as well as characteristics of B cell responses and antibody levels during ageing in relation to other cells and factors that are interwoven with B cell biological processes. In the elderly, fewer new B cells are generated, B cell responsiveness to antigens is impaired, and smaller and fewer germinal centers are formed within an immune response with participation of less potent T cells and follicular dendritic cells, leading to the production of reduced, often insufficient plasma cell numbers. Recall responses in the elderly appear to be limited by the cells\u2019 proliferative capacity. Hence, vaccine responsiveness is often insufficient and autoantibody production emerges in the elderly. In total, B cells appear to be less affected by age as compared with T cells. Recently, new concepts have been developed to counteract immunosenescence beyond active vaccination, comprising the generation of specific monoclonal antibodies for passive vaccination, immune rejuvenation by immunoablation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and modulation of lifestyle.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mei, Henrik E.; Radbruch, Andreas","journal":"Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fc3c38d068a01ab2b569860699610f37799ccb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cell responsiveness","B cell generation","fewer new B cells","characteristics of B cell responses","B cell biological processes","potent T cells","elderly","follicular dendritic cells","insufficient plasma cell numbers","autologous stem cell transplantation","vaccine responsiveness","immune rejuvenation","passive vaccination","generation of specific monoclonal antibodies","immune response","active vaccination","production of reduced","autoantibody production","Ageing individuals","new concepts","specific age-related changes","fewer germinal centers","immunoablation","antibody levels","autoimmunity","relation","participation","maintenance","activation","antigens","loss of immunological protection","modulation of lifestyle","studies","factors","immunosenescence","increased incidence","cells\u2019 proliferative capacity","total"],"language":"en"},

In addition to physiological factors, women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV transmission is primarily fuelled by gender inequality and gender-based discrimination and violence. Therefore, women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV transmission is closely linked to issues of empowerment and gender-based power relations. Even with this realization however, women are still sometimes overlooked in many HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment campaigns, such as those in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and responses to HIV/AIDS do not always actively seek to empower women. Therefore, a deficiency in women\u2019s human security increases their HIV/AIDS vulnerability. This chapter examines the intersection of gender inequality and HIV vulnerability as it applies to women in the PRC. The unequal status of many women in China, and the privileged position accorded to Chinese men, strongly indicates that Chinese women face a heightened vulnerability to HIV transmission. While many of these vulnerabilities are similar to women elsewhere in the world and certainly are not unique to China, by overlooking the many social, cultural, economic and political factors that contribute to HIV/AIDS vulnerability and transmission of the virus, particularly those faced by women, China has a long way to go before Chinese women are protected from HIV transmission. Given that HIV/AIDS heightens human insecurity, the stage is set for Chinese women (and men) to face an insecure future if the Chinese government does not fully implement international best practice, meaning a gendered response, into its overall HIV/AIDS response.","publish_time":"2011-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayes, Anna Marie","journal":"Human Security","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/289ac2f83dba115f354150b8a447f9e73e282f9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122858.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["Republic","China"],"keyphrases":["HIV vulnerability","HIV transmission","Chinese women","overall HIV","AIDS vulnerability","women\u2019s vulnerability","AIDS response","Chinese men","AIDS prevention","heightened vulnerability","Chinese government","gender-based discrimination","intersection of gender inequality","women\u2019s human security","gender-based power relations","People\u2019s Republic of China","PRC","world\u2019s leading causes of human insecurity","political factors","physiological factors","gendered response","issues of empowerment","international best practice","long way","stage","privileged position","social","insecure future","addition","treatment campaigns","responses","virus","violence","chapter","deficiency","unequal status","vulnerabilities","realization"],"language":"en"},

Until the invention of the electron microscope, it was impossible to visualize a virus. The first viruses to be visualized were bacteriophage, which appeared to have a head and tail-like structure. Only the nucleic acid entered the bacterial cell through the tail. Animal viruses were described as spherical or rod-shaped; they were bound to receptors and were taken up by the cell. After the crystallization of the tobacco mosaic virus, there was much discussion as to whether viruses were \u201Cliving\u201D organisms; the controversy continues to this day. Although viruses were defined in part on the basis of size and filterability, viruses much larger than the traditional viruses have recently been isolated. Studies of viral replication indicate that most viruses self-assemble as a result of interactions between the viral proteins to form a viral capsid that interacts with the nucleic acid to form the whole. The viral replication cycle and synthesis is presented in this chapter. Viral classification into a Linnaean scheme has been proposed, but newer methods using nucleic acid homologies are changing classification.

Spillovers from bats to humans either happen directly (via contact with infected bats) or indirectly (via intermediate hosts such as domestic or wildlife animals, by consuming food items contaminated by saliva, faeces or urine of bats, or via other environmental sources). Increasing numbers of breakouts of zoonotic viral diseases among humans and livestock have mainly been accounted to human encroachment into natural habitat, as well as agricultural intensification, deforestation and bushmeat consumption. Persecution of bats, including the destruction of their roosts and culling of whole colonies, has led not only to declines of protected bat species, but also to an increase in virus prevalence in some of these populations.

TGEV appearance in 1946 preceded identification of PEDV (1971) and PDCoV (2009) that are considered as emerging CoVs. A spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in Belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical. Since PRCV emergence and rapid spread, most pigs have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. In contrast, PDCoV and PEDV are currently expanding their geographic distribution, and there are reports on the circulation of TGEV-PEDV recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs (most severe in neonatal piglets) and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis. Necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea. Profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration, which can lead to the death of piglets. Strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge; however, these viruses display no cross-protection. Adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated CoVs. Recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vlasova, A.

As a result, there may be large differences in total epidemic size from similar initial conditions. This work seeks to determine the extent to which the effects of behavior changes and metapopulation coupling on epidemic size can be characterized. While mathematical models have been developed to study local containment by social distancing, intervention and other behavior changes, their connection to larger-scale transmission is relatively underdeveloped. We make use of the assumption that behavior changes limit local transmission before susceptible depletion to develop a time-varying birth-death process capturing the dynamic decrease of the transmission rate associated with behavior changes. We derive an expression for the mean outbreak size of this model and show that the distribution of outbreak sizes is approximately geometric. This allows a probabilistic extension whereby infected individuals may initiate new outbreaks. From this model we characterize the overall epidemic size as a function of the behavior change rate and the probability that an infected individual starts a new outbreak. We find good agreement between the analytical results and stochastic simulations leading to novel findings including critical learning rates that demarcate large and small epidemic sizes.","publish_time":"2016-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drake, John M.; Park, Andrew W.","journal":"Mathematical and Statistical Modeling for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e63c7b81f73940f10ac078108ea9c15e2c03c9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["local transmission","effects of behavior changes","total epidemic size","overall epidemic size","transmission rate","mean outbreak size","new outbreaks","probabilistic onward transmission","small epidemic sizes","local containment","local efforts","large differences","larger-scale transmission","Large epidemics","new locations","distribution of outbreak sizes","infected individuals","probabilistic extension","novel findings","critical learning rates","stochastic simulations","recent Ebola crisis","West Africa","intervention","susceptible depletion","time-varying birth-death process","analytical results","dynamic decrease","social distancing","similar initial conditions","connection","function","assumption","metapopulation","probability","good agreement","extent","expression","use","mathematical models","work"],"language":"en"},

The L-type CRD is named after the lectins found in abundance in the seeds of leguminous plants, such as concanavalin A from jack beans. The history of L-type lectins is as old as discovery of plant lectins from seeds of leguminous plants in nineteenth century. The structural motifs of L-type lectins are now known to be present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins from other eukaryotic organisms. The domain is present in plant, fungal, and animal proteins, but plant and animal L-type lectins have divergent sequences and different molecular properties. While plant lectins are secreted-soluble proteins and found at high level in specialised tissues, animal L-type lectins are (often membrane-bound) luminal proteins that are found at low levels in many different cell types. This observation suggests that animal L-type lectins have different functions. The crystal structures of some of the legume seed lectins show structural similarities among these lectins and to some other lectins, including the galectins and a variety of other lectins. Therefore, the term \u201CL-lectins\u201D has been designated as a classification for all lectins with this legume seed lectin-like structure.

Analysis of protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) has contributed numerous insights to the understanding of the regulation of signal pathways. Different approaches have been used to discover PPI and characterize protein complexes. In addition to conventional PPI methods, such as yeast two-hybrid (YTH), affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is emerging as an important and popular tool to unravel protein complex and elucidate protein function through the interaction partners. With the AP-MS method, protein complexes are prepared first by affinity purification directly from cell lysates, followed by characterization of their components by mass spectrometry. In contrast to most PPI methods, AP-MS reflects PPI under near physiological conditions in the relevant organism and cell type.

Perturbation of ER homeostasis can result in an accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen, causing ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). In humans, ER stress and UPR are closely associated with a vast number of diseases, including viral diseases. In plants, two arms that govern the UPR signaling network have been described: one that contains two ER membrane\u2013associated transcription factors (bZIP17 and bZIP28) and the other that encompasses a dual protein kinase (RNA-splicing factor IRE1) and its target RNA (bZIP60). Although early studies mainly focus on the essential roles of the UPR in abiotic stresses, the significance of UPR in plant diseases caused by virus infections has recently drawn much attention. This chapter summarizes the latest scenario of ER stress and UPR in virus-infected plant cells, highlights the emerging roles of the IRE1 pathway in virus infections, and outlines exciting future directions to spark more research interest in the UPR field in plants.","publish_time":"2016-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lingrui; Wang, Aiming","journal":"Current Research Topics in Plant Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e38bf91285ca43d2f9bad8085eba3618a25b160c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER membrane","ER lumen","significance of UPR","UPR field","latest scenario of ER stress","Perturbation of ER homeostasis","virus infections","plant diseases","unfolded protein response","protein synthesis","viral diseases","plants","virus-infected plant cells","dual protein kinase","vast number of diseases","RNA-splicing factor IRE1","emerging roles","essential roles","IRE1 pathway","target RNA","associated transcription factors","accumulation of unfolded proteins","abiotic stresses","bZIP17","research","central site","exciting future directions","bZIP28","endoplasmic reticulum","chapter","arms","humans","early studies","bZIP60","network","attention"],"language":"en"},

The immune response may also contribute in the context of immunopathogenesis to specific disease symptoms and either temporary or permanent damage to the host.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3fed3dab1ecbf57c4b7b70eb8014681045e7169.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host organism","specific disease symptoms","primary disease symptoms","virus","immunological methods","immunological defence responses","inapparent infection courses","context of immunopathogenesis","permanent damage","ways","mutual relationship","elimination","spread","cases","immune response","Viral infections","processes"],"language":"en"},

The many novel factors and separate classes of proteins identified within the nucleolus support this view that the nucleolus may perform additional functions beyond its known role in ribosome subunit biogenesis.

However, for the substantial number of analogies which are used in argument, their logical and other attributes have long been a source of fascination for investigators in a range of disciplines. It is argued in this chapter that cognitive agents use the argument from analogy as a facilitative heuristic to guide their judgements about public health problems when evidence or knowledge is not available in a particular context. To this extent, the argument is one type of adaptation of our rational procedures to the problem of uncertainty in the cognitive domain. Several examples of the use of this argument in a public health context are examined. The dialectical and epistemic features of this argument are addressed within a discussion of the use of analogical argument in systematic and heuristic reasoning. The results of a study of public health reasoning reveal that members of the public are adept at identifying the conditions under which the use of analogical argument is more or less rationally warranted.","publish_time":"2014-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, Louise","journal":"Reasoning and Public Health: New Ways of Coping with Uncertainty","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of analogical argument","public health context","public health problems","study of public health reasoning","heuristic reasoning","cognitive agents","cognitive affairs","cognitive domain","Similarities","facilitative heuristic","logical purpose","particular context","knowledge","evidence","judgements","rational procedures","problem of uncertainty","analogy","members","explanatory function","type of adaptation","investigators","people","places","conditions","discussion","source of fascination","thinking","objects","adept","epistemic features","attributes","results","chapter","range of disciplines","substantial number of analogies","interaction","extent","examples","environment"],"language":"en"},

Since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict, the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic. The highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Many patients with SARS-CoV experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died. Similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and West Nile Virus, the severity of SARS-CoV disease increased with age. Unfortunately, successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging (immune senescence). Due to the rapidity of virus emergence, technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology, pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult, candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection, and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation. We discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human SARS-CoV has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases. In addition, we review the evolution, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of epidemic and zoonotic SARS-CoV with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoonotic pool.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheahan, Timothy P.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26deaa379ee06900e2df31d7e936c57d21eb76d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123556.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic SARS-CoV","human SARS-CoV","severity of SARS","CoV disease","pathogenic SARS coronavirus","rapidity of virus emergence","pathogenesis of epidemic","viral pathogens","novel virus biology","identity of emerging pathogens","West Nile Virus","difficult task","reactive therapeutics","candidate vaccines","pathogenesis of viral diseases","development","synthetic biology","zoonotic pools","patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","rapid recombinant virus construction","antigenic identity of future emergence","global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome","pathogen-specific therapeutics","aged populations","vulnerable populations","animal reservoirs","synthetic reconstruction","exacerbated form of disease","evaluation of therapeutic interventions","ARDS","mechanical ventilation","immunological deficiencies","influenza","supplemental oxygen","panels","protection","aging","half","technologies","focus","molecular mechanisms","maximal breadth of cross","reconstructed viruses","model","immune senescence","tools","successful vaccination","evolution","epidemiology","addition","incidence"],"language":"en"},

The resilience of viruses and the tenacity of bacteria have led to the evolution of old diseases and the emergence of new infections. Continuous search for new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infectious diseases is, therefore, highly desirable. New infectious agents are discovering the human race, and the ecological changes are exposing mankind to new viruses and bacteria. In addition, air travel and disruption of geographic barriers are leading to new forms of infectious diseases. In the twentieth century, there was a widespread false optimism that infectious diseases are eradicated by antimicrobial agents. It was soon discovered that many infections require new strategies for the treatment of ocular infections. The new antimicrobial agents that have been introduced over the past century can be classified into four major categories including (1) antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis and integrity, (2) antibiotics that inhibit and suppress cell membrane functions, (3) antibiotics that interfere the protein synthesis, and (4) antibiotics that modulate nucleic acid synthesis. The selection of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of ocular infectious diseases is based on the most frequently encountered organisms, the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics, the dosage required, the ocular penetration, and the cost of therapy. The stumbling blocks to safe and effective antimicrobial therapy in ocular infections include the resistance of the microorganisms, toxicity of the drug, and poor ocular penetration of antimicrobial agents.","publish_time":"2014-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tabbara, Khalid F.","journal":"Ocular Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/740988119748bf5a9dc82b511062576ba48fc636.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123564/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new antimicrobial agents","New infectious agents","treatment of ocular infectious diseases","treatment of infectious diseases","treatment of ocular infections","new forms of infectious diseases","antibiotics","selection of antimicrobial agents","types of antimicrobial agents","poor ocular penetration of antimicrobial agents","new viruses","emergence of new infections","new strategies","effective antimicrobial therapy","evolution of old diseases","cell wall synthesis","protein synthesis","nucleic acid synthesis","cost of therapy","resilience of viruses","tenacity of bacteria","past century","cell membrane functions","disruption of geographic barriers","ecological changes","human race","air travel","drug","mankind","resistance","widespread false optimism","stumbling blocks","toxicity","pharmacokinetics","microorganisms","integrity","dosage","Continuous search","public health measures","trachoma","addition","encountered organisms","major categories","smallpox"],"language":"en"},

However, for most pathogens, we still have a limited understanding of how this affects epidemiology, persistence and virulence of infections\u2014including several zoonotic pathogens that reside in wild animal reservoirs and spillover into humans. In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) as host for pathogens. This species is widely distributed, often occupying habitats close to humans and livestock, and is an important game bird species and the ancestor to domestic ducks\u2014thereby being an excellent model species to highlight aspects of the wildlife, domestic animal interface and the relevance for human health. We discuss mallard as host for a range of pathogens but focus more in depth of it as a reservoir host for influenza A virus (IAV). Over the last decades, IAV research has surged, prompted in part to the genesis and spread of highly pathogenic virus variants that have been devastating to domestic poultry and caused a number of human spillover infections. The aim of this chapter is to synthesise and review the intricate interactions of virus, host and environmental factors governing IAV epidemiology and evolution.","publish_time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Latorre-Margalef, Neus; Waldenstr\u00F6m, Jonas","journal":"Modeling the Transmission and Prevention of Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf9626089487d90285e3202dc0aba144dc208c67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","reservoir host","zoonotic pathogens","range of pathogens","IAV epidemiology","domestic animal interface","domestic ducks","domestic poultry","excellent model species","humans","IAV research","chapter","number of human spillover infections","important game bird species","intricate interactions of virus","pathogenic virus variants","virulence of infections","human health","wild animal reservoirs","current knowledge of mallard","environmental factors","ancestor","aspects","Anas platyrhynchos","relevance","wildlife","livestock","evolution","influenza","persistence","depth","limited understanding","hallmark of disease","habitats","decades","genesis","aim"],"language":"en"},

Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife\u2013human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and \u2018spill-over\u2019 and \u2018spill-back\u2019; and technology and industry for domestic animal\u2013human EIDs.

Microorganisms establish compositionally complex communities on the leaf surface. The microbiome of phyllosphere is rich in diversity of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, and viruses. The diversity, dispersal, and community development on the leaf surface are based on the physiochemistry, environment, and also the immunity of the host plant. A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment. To the scientific advancement, several molecular techniques like metagenomics and metaproteomics have been used to study and understand the physiology and functional relationship of microbes to the host and its environment. Based on the available information, this chapter describes the basic understanding of microbiome in leaf structure and physiology, microbial interactions, especially bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, and their adaptation in the phyllosphere environment. Further, the detailed information related to the importance of the microbiome in phyllosphere to the host plant and their environment has been analyzed. Besides, biopotentials of the phyllosphere microbiome have been reviewed.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sivakumar, Natesan; Sathishkumar, Ramamoorthy; Selvakumar, Gopal; Shyamkumar, Rajaram; Arjunekumar, Kalimuthu","journal":"Plant Microbiomes for Sustainable Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08320e4117b74f543fa3d2e1a5d217df331faaa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phyllosphere environment","microbiome of phyllosphere","phyllosphere microbiome","host plant","surrounding environment","leaf surface","leaf structure","diversity of bacteria","fungi","physiology","basic understanding of microbiome","total aerial plant surfaces","actinomycetes","microorganisms","functional relationship of microbes","functional communication","detailed information","available information","endophytic mode of life cycle","microbial interactions","molecular techniques","ground portions","chapter","community development","important event","metagenomics","cyanobacteria","complex communities","importance","scientific advancement","colonization process","metaproteomics","habitat","dispersal","physiochemistry","adaptation","immunity","viruses","biopotentials"],"language":"en"}]}

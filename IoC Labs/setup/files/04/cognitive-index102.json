Although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown, SARS-CoV2 is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets. Unlike with SARS-CoV, maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness, and this is supported by models that suggest 40-80% of transmission events occur from pre- and asymptomatic individuals. One widely-discussed strategy to limit transmission of SARS-CoV2, particularly from presymptomatic individuals, has been population-level wearing of masks. Modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even 50% mask-use. COVID-19 has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza, and the impacts on these parameters, and critically, at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask-use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown. We derived a simplified SIR model to investigate the effects of near-universal mask-use on COVID-19 assuming 8 or 16% mask efficacy. We decided to model, in particular, the impact of masks on numbers of critically-ill patients and cumulative mortality, since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical-care and mortality rates when transmissibility (Reff) was high, the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective R approached 1, as might be expected after aggressive social-distancing measures such as wide-spread lockdowns. One major concern with COVID-19 is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-rich settings, with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical-care. We incorporated this into our model, increasing death rates for when critical-care resources have been exhausted. Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javid, Babak; Balaban, Nathalie Q","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3a3324af4dea9ef7d629e6af281e968e0495daf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063529","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mask use","mask efficacy","COVID","pandemic trajectory mask-use","universal mask","maximal benefit","mortality rates","transmission of SARS","SARS-CoV2","pandemic influenza","substantial mortality","cumulative mortality","current pandemic","global pandemic","simple model","minor benefit","effective lockdown","critical-care resources","simplified SIR model","modest efficacy of masks","transmission events","impact of masks","effects of near","effective R approaches","parameters","maximal viral shedding","precise transmission routes","death rates","ill patients","asymptomatic individuals","presymptomatic individuals","hospitalized patients","infection trajectory","total numbers","tipping point","sophisticated models","post-lockdown strategies","dynamics","deaths","Reff","nations","transmissibility","higher hospitalization","aggressive social-distancing measures","reduction","early phase of illness","healthcare infrastructures","population-level","severe consequences","resource-rich settings","impacts","potential","Modelling","contagious respiratory droplets","lockdowns","major concern","scenario","strategy","exponential growth"],"language":"en"},

Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Hsiang-Yu; Mao, Axiu; Han, Guiyuan; Yuan, Hsiangkuo; Pfeiffer, Dirk","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5c3358b3235f360e8de5ace8908040480d29822.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","Mainland China"],"keyphrases":["symptom onset","Hong Kong","early quarantine","quarantine measures","imported cases","Mainland China","control effects","effect of control measures","reproductive number larger","spread of virus","early expansion period","massive number of travellers","subsequent local infections","local confirmed cases","meta-population model","rapid expansion of COVID","transmission dynamics","community spread","suspected case","infected case","daily transportation data","Wuhan","huge social-economic loss","outbreak","SEIQR","transmissibility","key factor","incubation time","days","world","regions","results","critical steps","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

As a measure of transmissibility, the value of basic reproduction number varies over time during an epidemic of infectious disease. Hence, this study aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number over time during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: We extracted the epidemic data from the \u0022Tracking the Epidemic\u0022 website of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the duration of January 19, 2020 and March 14, 2020. Then, we applied the novel method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the time-varying reproduction number in the R software. Results: The epidemic curve of daily new confirmed cases in China peaked around February 4-6, 2020, and then declined gradually, except the very high peak on February 12, 2020 owing to the added clinically diagnosed cases (Hubei Province only). Under two specified plausible scenarios for the distribution of serial interval, both curves of the estimated time-varying reproduction numbers fell below 1.0 around February 17-18, 2020. Finally, the COVID-19 epidemic in China abated around March 7-8, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China were effective. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated time-varying reproduction number going downhill was more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urged public health authorities and scientists to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers routinely during epidemics of infectious diseases and to report them daily to the public until the end of the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Fu-Chang; Wen, Fang-Yu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbaadfdfe0cfb67bc843b8e7171bb8211ed50218.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061838","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["epidemic data","ongoing epidemic of infectious disease","estimated time-varying reproduction numbers","epidemic curve of daily new confirmed cases","COVID","daily number of new confirmed cases","value of basic reproduction number","data of daily new confirmed cases","Disease Control","coronavirus disease","aggressive control measures of China","epidemics of infectious diseases","public health authorities","Chinese Center","curves","scientists","distribution of serial interval","incidence","Prevention","EpiEstim packages","specified plausible scenarios","prompt","website","drops","R software","measure of transmissibility","owing","duration","Results","end","novel method","high peak","Hubei Province","Conclusion","Methods","progression","study","Background"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People\u0027s Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like \u0022crazy-paving\u0022 patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a \u0022dandelion clek-like\u0022 sign and 37 with a \u0022dandelion seed sign\u0022.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out to analyze the clinical data of selective endoscopy performed at the Endoscopic Center, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University from February 20 to March 6, 2020. Clinical data included epidemiological questionnaire, chief complaints, endoscopic findings and biopsy pathology results, etc. All medical staff had blood test for IgM/IgG antibodies of COVID-19. Patients and their families were followed up by phone to determine whether they were infected with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the clinical data of selective endoscopy during the same period from February 20 to March 6, 2019 were collected as the control group to compare the overall results of endoscopy examinations during the epidemic and the detection rate of GI malignancy. Results: A total of 911 patients underwent endoscopy in the epidemic period group, and a total of 5746 cases in the control group, which was 6.3 times over the epidemic period group. In the epidemic period group, 544 cases received gastroscopy and 367 cases received colonoscopy, while 3433 cases received gastroscopy and 2313 cases received colonoscopy in the control group, which were both 6.3 times of epidemic period group. Gastroscopy revealed that 39 patients (7.2%) were diagnosed with upper GI malignancies in the epidemic period group and 77 patients (2.2%) in the control group with significant difference (\u03C7(2)=40.243, P\u003C0.001). The detection rate of gastric cancer in these two groups was 3.3% (n=18) and 1.7% (n=59) respectively with significant difference (\u03C7(2)=6.254,P=0.012). The detection rate of esophageal cancer was 3.7% (n=20) and 0.5% (n=18) respectively with significant difference (\u03C7(2)=49.303,P\u003C0.001). Colonoscopy revealed that colorectal cancer was found in 32 cases (8.7%) of the epidemic period group and 88 cases (3.8%) of the control group with significant difference (\u03C7(2)=17.888, P\u003C0.001). During the epidemic period, no infection of medical staff was found through the blood test of IgM/IgG antibodies on COVID-19. No patient and family members were infected with COVID-19 by phone follow-up. Conclusion: Compared with the same period in 2019, the number of selective endoscopy decreases sharply during the epidemic period, while the detection rate of various GI malignant tumors increases significantly, which indicates that patients with high-risk symptoms of GI malignancies should still receive endoscopy as soon as possible. Provided strict adherence to the epidemic prevention standards formulated by the state and professional societies, it is necessary to carry out clinical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, L; Cai, M Y; Shi, Q; Wang, P; Li, Q L; Zhong, Y S; Yao, L Q; Zhou, P H","journal":"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020-0316-00147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gastroscopy"],"organizations":["IgM/IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["times of epidemic period group","control group","cases","Patients","clinical data of selective endoscopy","epidemic prevention standards","safety of selective endoscopy","number of selective endoscopy","significant difference","detection rate of GI malignancy","overall results of endoscopy examinations","detection rate of gastric cancer","detection rate of esophageal cancer","IgG antibodies of COVID","colonoscopy","gastroscopy","upper GI malignancies","detection rate of various GI malignant tumors","clinical diagnosis","high-risk symptoms of GI malignancies","blood test of IgM","total","colorectal cancer","biopsy pathology results","infection of medical staff","endoscopic findings","Endoscopic Center","phone follow-up","chief complaints","epidemiological questionnaire","state","Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University","outbreak of coronavirus disease","strict adherence","necessity","professional societies","Methods","retrospective cohort study","family members","groups","treatment","families","Objective","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were \u226565 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers.

The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID-19 patients show elevated D-Dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state. Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy. However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis. In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial. Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whyte, Claire S; Morrow, Gael B; Mitchell, Joanne L; Chowdary, Pratima; Mutch, Nicola J","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","deposition of fibrin","fibrin deposition","lungs of patients","Fibrin deposits","pre-existing fibrin","associated ARDS","Prophylaxis treatment of COVID","lung epithelium","lung parenchyma","tissue-type plasminogen activator","tPA","Nebulizer plasminogen activators","pathophysiology of ARDS results","elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor","damaged alveolar endothelial cells","alveolar space","acute inflammation","surface of leukocytes","nebulizer form","Tissue factor","recruitment of leukocytes","fibrinolytic systems","local fibrinolysis","elevated D-Dimers","repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs","local inflammatory response","approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment","development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","LMWH","low molecular weight heparin","targeted approach","prevention of normal gas exchange","dysregulation","PAI","air spaces","Phase","TF","global pandemic of coronavirus disease","oxygenation","proinflammatory cytokines","hypofibrinolytic state","plastic bronchitis","coagulation","fibrinogen","increase","consistent finding","ventilation","clinical trial","coagulopathy","review"],"language":"en"},

However, the effectiveness of this medication in patients with burns remains uncertain. Accordingly, investigators sought to assess wound re-epithelialization in patients with second-degree burns after adding pirfenidone to usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING Single-center pilot, proof-of-concept, single-blind randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION Eight patients with second-degree burns were treated with occlusive hydrocolloid dressings and were randomly allocated to receive either no additional treatment or pirfenidone. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate wound healing between groups based on the thickness of the re-epithelialized epidermis at day 7. Secondary outcomes were to qualitatively assess the development of fibrotic tissue in the dermis, anomalies in the basal membrane, and the development of collagen fibers by histologic analysis. Liver and renal functions were measured daily to assess the overall safety of oral pirfenidone. MAIN RESULTS Patients treated with pirfenidone showed a remarkable improvement in wound re-epithelialization at day 7 (148.98 \u00B1 13.64 vs 119.27 \u00B1 15.55 \u03BCm; P = .029; 95% confidence interval, 4.14-55.29). Histologic evaluations showed less wound fibrosis in the pirfenidone group. CONCLUSIONS A decrease in wound healing time by enhancing wound re-epithelialization was observed with pirfenidone. Larger clinical trials are needed to reach more reliable conclusions.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mecott, Gabriel A; Gonz\u00E1lez-Cant\u00FA, Iv\u00E1n; Dorsey-Trevi\u00F1o, Edgar Gerardo; Matta-Yee-Chig, Daniel; Saucedo-C\u00E1rdenas, Odila; Montes de Oca-Luna, Roberto; P\u00E9rez-Porras, Sergio; Garc\u00EDa-P\u00E9rez, Mauricio M","journal":"Advances in skin \u0026 wound care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000655484.95155.f7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32195729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wound re-epithelialization","wound fibrosis","pirfenidone group","wound healing time","second-degree burns","overall safety of oral pirfenidone","MAIN RESULTS Patients","re-epithelialized epidermis","day","OUTCOME MEASURES","primary outcome","histologic analysis","Histologic evaluations","reliable conclusions","development of collagen fibers","development of fibrotic tissue","SETTING Single-center pilot","single-blind randomized controlled trial","concept","proof","remarkable improvement","anomalies","thickness","study","basal membrane","DESIGN","medication","label use","decrease","INTERVENTION","occlusive hydrocolloid dressings","usual care","vs","groups","investigators","Larger clinical trials","Liver","renal functions","\u03BCm","effectiveness","additional treatment","OBJECTIVE","studies","confidence interval","Secondary outcomes"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of treating recurrent sCA. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 52 patients with 60 recurrent sCAs who were retreated and 1534 patients with 1817 sCAs who received initial treatment. The primary outcome was a recurrence of the aneurysm. Secondary outcomes were an additional treatment, rupture after treatment, and a neurological worsening, which was defined as an increase of 1 or more scores using the modified Rankin Scale at 12-month. Safety outcomes included postoperative ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. We compiled the 120 (60 each) propensity score-matched cohort based on a propensity score for the treatment of recurrent sCA. In the propensity score-matched cohort, recurrence after treatment was observed in 25% and 6.7% of cases in the retreatment and initial treatment groups, respectively. The odds ratio of recurrence after treatment was 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15; P = 0.011). The secondary and safety outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. This study showed that the treatment of recurrent sCA was a risk factor for recurrence after treatment but not for additional treatment, rupture after treatment, or neurological worsening.

Therefore, we compared the ITA indications for RRA with the recommendations by the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA). METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 380 consecutive DTC patients treated with surgery and RRA, followed at the Section of Endocrinology, University of Siena, Italy from January 2006 to December 2019. RESULTS Using ITA a significant increase of DTC patients classified as low or high risk and a significant decrease of patients defined at intermediate risk were observed (p \u003C 0.0001). Consequently, the percentage of patients without routinary indication for RRA (47.4%, versus 38.2%, p \u003C 0.0001) and those with a definite indication for RRA (8.2 versus 1.8%, p \u003C 0.0001) was significantly higher compared to ATA. Moreover, using ITA the percentage of patients with a selective use of RRA was lower in comparison to ATA (44.7% versus 60%, p \u003C 0.0001). Nevertheless, the prevalence of distant metastases, at post-ablative whole body scan, in patients without indication for RRA, was not different using either ATA or ITA (2.1% and 1.1% respectively, p = 0.37). CONCLUSION The use of ITA Consensus, in clinical practice, increases significantly the number of patients for whom RRA is not routinely indicated in comparison to ATA guidelines but without differences in delaying the diagnosis of distant metastatic disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forleo, R; Fralassi, N; Maino, F; Capezzone, M; Brilli, L; Pilli, T; Cantara, S; Castagna, M G","journal":"Journal of endocrinological investigation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-020-01283-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DTC","ITA","RRA","ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percentage of patients","number of patients","consecutive DTC patients","significant decrease of patients","selective use of RRA","significant increase of DTC patients","ITA indications","ATA guidelines","use of ITA Consensus","recommendations","comparison","routinary indication","clinical practice","definite indication","high risk","intermediate risk","American Thyroid Association guidelines","Italian Consensus","differentiated thyroid cancer","prevalence of distant metastases","diagnosis of distant metastatic disease","post-ablative","body scan","differences","University of Siena","Section of Endocrinology","radioiodine remnant ablation","surgery","Italy","PURPOSE","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS All laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in adults admitted to an academic medical center in Seattle, WA between March 2 and March 26, 2020 were included. We evaluated individuals with and without severe disease, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death. RESULTS One-hundred-five COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. Thirty-five percent were admitted from a senior home or skilled nursing facility. The median age was 69 years and half were women.Three or more comorbidities were present in 55% of patients, with hypertension (59%), obesity (47%), cardiovascular disease (38%) and diabetes (33%) being the most prevalent. Most (63%) had symptoms for 5 days or longer prior to admission. Only 39% had fever in the first 24 hours, whereas 41% had hypoxia at admission. Seventy-three percent of patients had lymphopenia.

We aimed to identify clinical and imaging determinants that are associated with collateral grade on baseline computed tomography angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Methods- Patients included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands; n=500) and MR CLEAN Registry (n=1488) were studied. Collateral status on baseline computed tomography angiography was scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to test the association of selected determinants with collateral status. Results- In total, 1988 patients were analyzed. Distribution of the collateral status was as follows: absent (7%, n=123), poor (32%, n=596), moderate (39%, n=735), and good (23%, n=422). Associations for a poor collateral status in a multivariable model existed for age (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 per 10 years [95% CI, 0.886-0.98]), male (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]), blood glucose level (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]), and occlusion of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus (adjusted common odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI, 0.41-0.61]). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between cardiovascular risk factors and collateral status. Conclusions- Older age, male sex, high glucose levels, and intracranial internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus occlusions are associated with poor computed tomography angiography collateral grades in patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiegers, Eveline J A; Mulder, Maxim J H L; Jansen, Ivo G H; Venema, Esmee; Compagne, Kars C J; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Emmer, Bart J; Marquering, Henk A; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Sprengers, Marieke E; van Zwam, Wim H; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Majoie, Charles B L M; Roozenbeek, Bob; Lingsma, Hester F; Dippel, Diederik W J; van der Lugt, Aad","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32279619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MR CLEAN Registry"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poor collateral status","Purpose- Collateral circulation status","common odds ratio","poor computed tomography angiography collateral grades","acute ischemic stroke eligible","baseline computed tomography angiography","Methods- Patients","effect of endovascular treatment","Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment","MR CLEAN trial","intracranial internal carotid artery","anterior circulation large vessel occlusion","MR CLEAN Registry","association of selected determinants","terminus occlusions","male sex","intracranial segment","multivariable model","imaging determinants","high glucose levels","blood glucose level","Conclusions- Older age","Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses","functional outcome","cardiovascular risk factors","Background","Netherlands","years","Associations","contrast","previous studies","Results","total","Distribution"],"language":"en"},

The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. METHODS Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. RESULTS All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (\u003C1.0 \u00D7 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. CONCLUSIONS The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation. Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.

Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in-hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2-4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C-trough DOAC level , expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22th and March 15th 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20, and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C-trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in pre-hospitalization period. CONCLUSION DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS-CoV-2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Testa, Sophie; Prandoni, Paolo; Paoletti, Oriana; Morandini, Rossella; Tala, Maurizio; Dellanoce, Claudia; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Betti, Monia; Danzi, Gian Battista; Pan, Angelo; Palareti, Gualtiero","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DOAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSION DOAC patients","antiviral treatment","antiviral therapy","DOAC plasma levels","DOAC therapy","DOAC measurement","BACKGROUND Antiviral drugs","consecutive patients","series of patients","SARS-CoV","Concomitant administration of antiviral agents","C-trough DOAC level","Plasma samples","plasma concentration","C-trough levels","candidates","Cremona Hospital","withholding DOACs","hours","pre-hospitalization period","results","alarming increase","Cremona Thrombosis Center","times higher","respiratory syndrome","physicians","severe COVID","lopinavir","potential","dose intake","dabigatran","apixaban","ritonavir","alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies","bleeding complications","direct oral anticoagulants","darunavir","average","days","METHODS","order","rivaroxaban","edoxaban","discharge"],"language":"en"},

Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) \u0026 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs. 4%, P=0.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.

She had a concomitant metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.46, HCO3- 40 mmol/L, pCO2 54.6 mmHg). A history of significant Quick-Eze use (a calcium carbonate based antacid) for abdominal discomfort, for 2 weeks prior to presentation, suggested a diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome (MAS). Further investigations did not demonstrate malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism. Following management with i.v. fluid rehydration and a single dose of i.v. bisphosphonate, she developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia requiring oral and parenteral calcium replacement. She was discharged from the hospital with stable biochemistry on follow-up. This case demonstrates the importance of a detailed history in the diagnosis of severe hypercalcaemia, with MAS representing the third most common cause of hypercalcaemia. We discuss its pathophysiology and clinical importance, which can often present with severe hypercalcaemia that can respond precipitously to calcium-lowering therapy. Learning points Milk-alkali syndrome is an often unrecognised cause for hypercalcaemia, but is the third most common cause of admission for hypercalcaemia. Calcium ingestion leading to MAS can occur at intakes as low as 1.0-1.5 g per day in those with risk factors. Early recognition of this syndrome can avoid the use of calcium-lowering therapy such as bisphosphonates which can precipitate hypocalcaemia.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Mawson; Cho, Catherine; Gray, Callum; Chai, Thora Y; Daud, Ruhaida; Luttrell, Matthew","journal":"Endocrinology, diabetes \u0026 metabolism case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-20-0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of calcium","symptomatic hypercalcaemia","common cause of hypercalcaemia","calcium carbonate","corrected calcium","Calcium ingestion","diagnosis of severe hypercalcaemia","MAS","parenteral calcium replacement","diagnosis of milk","symptomatic hypocalcaemia","abdominal discomfort","mmol","unrecognised cause","common cause of admission","case","therapy","Learning points Milk-alkali syndrome","detailed history","clinical importance","history of significant Quick-Eze use","antacid","fluid rehydration","single dose of","HCO3","confusion","weeks","presentation","year-old female","concomitant metabolic alkalosis","malignancy","day","hospital","stable biochemistry","follow-up","myalgias","bisphosphonates","primary hyperparathyroidism","risk factors","investigations","management","pathophysiology","pCO2","mmHg","Early recognition","intakes","Summary"],"language":"en"},

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. Methods We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. Results Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Summary Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M; Craig, Timothy J","journal":"Pulmonary therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41030-020-00118-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Subjects Protection Office"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus pathogenesis","study of coronavirus","SARS-CoV","contact system","Summary Activation of complement","refractory edema","observed pulmonary edema","angiotensin receptor antagonists","lung disease","disease etiology","co-receptor","generation of bradykinin","respiratory arrest","traditional interventions","ethics guidelines","associated pneumonia","Introduction COVID","wild-type mice","precise therapeutic interventions","C3 knockout mice","institutional review board approval","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines","antiviral therapy","exempt","convalescent plasma","hydroxychloroquine","profound increase","ACE-inhibitors","anti-IL","presentation","antihistamines","cytokines","ARDS","recent literature","search","ACE2","PubMed","Results Mouse models","so-called cytokine storm","work","corticosteroids","azithromycin","death","evidence","benefit","risk","suspicions","reason","Methods","potential treatments","manuscript","enzyme","roles","viruses","studies"],"language":"en"},

From that date, the Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) to the management of EMS during the epidemic. The aim of the study is to assess in this context the impact of BI on EMS management outcomes. METHODS Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU is using BI daily to track the number of first aid requests received from 112. BI analyses the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI allows identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). RESULTS AREU decides to reallocate in the territory the resources based on real-time data recorded and elaborated by BI. Indeed, based on that data, the numbers of vehicles and personnel have been implemented in the municipalities that registered more episodes and where the clusters are supposed to be. BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sechi, Giuseppe Maria; Migliori, Maurizio; Dassi, Gabriele; Pagliosa, Andrea; Bonora, Rodolfo; Oradini-Alacreu, Aurea; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo; Zoli, Alberto; Response Team, Areu Covid-","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Regional Emergency Medical Services","EMS) Trust","Business Intelligence","EMS","BI"],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["impact of BI","BI impact","BI analyses","management of EMS","EMS management outcomes","EMS management response","outbreak","infectious episodes","SARS-CoV","Lombardy region","COVID","number of requests","RESULTS AREU","study","epidemic","AIM","clusters","numerical trend of episodes","timely decisions","informed decisions","real-time data","little evidence-based literature","aid requests","Regional Emergency Medical Services","Trust","Codogno hospital","Business Intelligence","health care","date","municipality","telephone dispatch interview","territory","paramount importance","context","personnel","numbers of vehicles","resources","beginning","patterns","BACKGROUND","WORK","patient","METHODS","municipalities","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Between 1997 and 2018, a total of 449 patients {372 males; mean age 54.2 [standard deviation (SD) 15.2] years, range: 12.7-79.9 years} underwent elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) for aortic regurgitation and were prospectively followed up clinically and echocardiographically. RESULTS The follow-up was 94% complete. Cumulative follow-up time was 2268 patient-years [mean follow-up time 5.1 (4.3 SD) years]. Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% (n = 10). Late (\u003E30 days) survival did not differ from that of the age- and gender-matched general population. Freedom from reoperation in patients without additional cusp reconstruction was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 91-98] and 92% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was not significantly different (P = 1) for patients who did require additional cusp reconstruction 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 89% (95% CI 81-99). In patients with tricuspid aortic valves (n = 338), freedom from reoperation was 96% (95% CI 94-99) and 93% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (n = 111) had a freedom from reoperation of 94% (95% CI 89-99) at 5 years and 88% (95% CI 79-98) at 10 years (P = 0.021 for the comparison to tricuspid aortic valve). Overall, 23 patients (5%; 1%/patient-year) required reoperation with a mean interval of 4.5 (4.8 SD) months.

Study design The medical records of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic adnexal surgery between May 2017 and April 2019 were reviewed. Of the 80 patients, 40 patients underwent gasless SPA laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor and 40 underwent conventional SPA laparoscopy. All surgeries were performed by one laparoscopic surgeon. Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There are no significant differences in age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, tumor marker, and tumor diameter between the gasless and conventional groups. The median retraction setup time from skin incision was 7 min (range 5-12 min) in gasless SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery. The median total operation times were 55.5 min (range 30-155 min) in the gasless group and 55 min (range 30-165 min) in the conventional group without a significant difference. Additionally, there were no differences in operation type, conversion rate of laparotomy, use of an additional trocar, and pathological outcomes between the two groups.

It was first identified at Wuhan City of China during December 2019. OBJECTIVE The study to identify top-15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. The comparison between identified top-15 countries for confirmed, death and recovery of the cases and further advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting the spreading of COVID-19 disease trajectories of COVID-19 for next two months. METHODS The COVID-19 daily data collected and cumulatively represented as spatial map for more than 200 countries and territories. The spatial map useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infected people, top-15 countries and continent. The recent reported data for confirmed, death and recovery for last three months was represented and compared in between the top-15 infected countries. The advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) used for predicting the future data based on time-series data. The ARIMA model provide weight to past few values and error values to corrects it model prediction, so it better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative cases and predicted cases for top-15 countries for confirmed, death and recovery from COVID-19 disease. RESULTS The top-15 countries, with a high number of confirmed cases are stratified to include its data in mathematical model. The identified top-15 countries cumulative cases, death, and recovery of COVID-19 information were compared. The USA, UK, Turkey, China, Russia relatively fast spreading of disease. The fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil and slow recovery ratio in USA, UK, Netherlands, Russia and Italy. The large number of death rate ratio in Italy, UK and less ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, USA. The ARIMA model used to predict estimated confirmed, death and recovery cases for the top-15 countries for 24 April to 07 July. Its value is represented with 95%, 80% and 70 % confidence interval values. The validation of ARIMA model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value, its value in the range of 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirm cases, death and recovery COVID-19 cases, represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS The observed predicted values represent the confirmed, death and recovery cases gets doubled in all the countries except China, Switzerland and Germany. It was also observed the death and recovery rate were faster as comparison to confirmed cases during next two months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in USA, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany and UK. The forecast analysis of COVID-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world, and it looks scarier than imagined, but recovery numbers also look promising by July 07, 2020.

METHODS Among a total of 62 chronic HD patients, H1N1 infection was identified in 12 (19.4%). Of the 32 staff members, four (12.5%) were found to be infected with the H1N1 virus. Outcomes included symptoms at presentation, comorbidities, occurrence of hypoxemia, hospital admission, and clinical evaluation. Infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The 12 patients who had H1N1 infection did not differ significantly from the other 50 non-infected patients with respect to age, sex, dialysis vintage, dialysis modality, or proportion of comorbidities. Obesity was higher in the H1N1-infected group (41.5 vs. 4%, p\u003C0.002). The most common symptoms were fever (92%), cough (92%), and rhinorrhea (83%). Early empirical antiviral treatment with oseltamivir was started in symptomatic patients and infection control measures, including the intensification of contact-reduction measures by the staff members, antiviral chemoprophylaxis to asymptomatic patients undergoing HD in the same shift of infected patients, and dismiss of staff members suspected of being infected, were implemented to control the spread of infection in the dialysis unit. CONCLUSION The clinical course of infection with H1N1 in our patients was favorable. None of the patients developed severe disease and the strategies adopted to control the outbreak were successful.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ventura, Carlucci Gualberto; Roque, Fel\u00EDcio Lopes; Sousa, Itanilton Queiroz de; Lobo, Renata Desordi; Luders, Claudio","journal":"Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : \u0027orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1590/2175-8239-jbn-2019-0180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227069/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 infection","asymptomatic patients","non-infected patients","shift of infected patients","infection control measures","spread of infection","clinical outcomes of chronic HD patients","clinical course of infection","H1N1-infected group","H1N1 virus","dialysis unit","staff members","dialysis vintage","dialysis modality","clinical evaluation","strategies","outbreak of influenza","INTRODUCTION Chronic hemodialysis","reduction measures","antiviral chemoprophylaxis","proportion of comorbidities","common symptoms","Early empirical antiviral treatment","sex","occurrence of hypoxemia","oseltamivir","respect","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","hospital admission","intensification of contact","presentation","total","fever","severe disease","CONCLUSION","high risk","METHODS","Obesity","cough","rhinorrhea"],"language":"en"},

To avoid harm for patients without large vessel occlusion from delayed access to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), it has been suggested to only redirect patients with high likelihood of large vessel occlusion for whom the additional delay to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) caused by transport to the CSC is below a certain threshold. However, which threshold achieves the greatest clinical benefit is unknown. Methods- We used mathematical modeling to calculate additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds associated with the greatest reduction in disability-adjusted life years in abstracted 2-stroke center and multiple-stroke center scenarios. Model parameters were extracted from recent meta-analyses or large prospective cohort studies. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic and 2-way univariate sensitivity analyses. Results- Assuming ideal treatment time performance metrics, transport to the nearest CSC was the preferred strategy irrespective of additional delay-to-IVT when the transfer time between primary stroke center and CSC was \u003C40 minutes (95% credible interval: 25-66 minutes); otherwise, the optimal additional delay-to-IVT-threshold ranged from 28 to 139 minutes. In multiple-stroke center scenarios, optimal additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds were 30 to 54 minutes in urban and 49 to 141 minutes in rural settings; use of optimal thresholds as compared with a 15 minute-threshold saved 0 to 0.11 and 0 to 0.37 disability-adjusted life years per triage case, respectively. Assuming slower treatment times at primary stroke centers and CSCs yielded longer permissible additional delays. Conclusions- Our results suggest that patients with acute ischemic stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion should be redirected to a CSC if the additional delay to IVT is \u003C30 minutes in urban and 50 minutes in rural settings.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlemm, Ludwig; Endres, Matthias; Nolte, Christian H","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31964288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSC","IVT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["minutes","IVT-threshold","optimal additional delay","optimal additional-delay","IVT thresholds","comprehensive stroke center","multiple-stroke center scenarios","acute ischemic stroke","large vessel occlusion benefit","primary stroke centers","suspected large vessel occlusion","high likelihood of large vessel occlusion","nearest CSC","permissible additional delays","optimal thresholds","Purpose- Patients","minute-threshold","certain threshold","direct transport","large prospective cohort studies","disability-adjusted life years","intravenous thrombolysis","Results","rural settings","greatest clinical benefit","greatest reduction","transfer time","ideal treatment time performance metrics","recent meta-analyses","slower treatment times","way univariate sensitivity analyses","delayed access","CSCs","preferred strategy","triage case","capable of endovascular therapy","mathematical modeling","harm","Model parameters","Background","credible interval","Methods","Conclusions","Uncertainty"],"language":"en"},

We aim to explore reliable evidences for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak. A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS Overall, 31 articles and 46959 patients were included, including 10 English articles, 21 Chinese articles. The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%, 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%, 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%, 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%, 0.253-0.456), chest distress (31.2%, -0.024-0.648). The main imaging finding were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%, 0.639-0.871), and ground glass opacification (69.9%, 0.602-0.796). Among the patients, the incidence of required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%, 0.190-0.395), the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was (28.8%, 0.147-0.429), the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was (8.5%, -0.008-0.179), and and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%, 0.044-0.093). CONCLUSION COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease, which mainly causes bilateral pneumonia, and lung function will deteriorate rapidly. Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to cause respiratory failure or even death. This article is protected by copyright.

Older adults are under a high risk of infection because of weaker immune systems. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent scientific evidence that outlines the effects of exercise on influenza or pneumonia in older adults. An electronic literature search was conducted using the WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCEDIRECT and GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases using the following keywords, \u0022Exercise,\u0022 \u0022Older adult,\u0022 \u0022Influenza,\u0022 and \u0022Pneumonia.\u0022 Any randomized control trials, cross-sectional and observational studies that related to this topic were all included. Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Thirteen randomized control trials investigated the effects of exercise on the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination: seven trials employed moderate aerobic exercise, three employed resistance exercise, and the remaining three used Asian martial arts or special home-based exercises. Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia. Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults. In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial. Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Yang; Ren, Feng; Sun, Dong; Wang, Meizi; Baker, Julien S; Istv\u00E1n, B\u00EDr\u00F3; Gu, Yaodong","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WEB OF SCIENCE","GOOGLE SCHOLAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of exercise","vigorous exercise","risk of influenza","employed resistance exercise","influenza-related diseases","prolonged moderate aerobic exercise","pneumonia vaccination","Older adults","observational studies","immune responses","current studies","related infection","different effects of moderate","randomized control trials","review","used Asian martial arts","traditional Asian martial arts","high risk of infection","weaker immune systems","GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases","special home-based exercises","WEB OF SCIENCE","SCIENCEDIRECT","following keywords","training","associations","physical condition","addition","recent scientific evidence","eligibility criteria","electronic literature search","Future research","greatest threats","world","topic","coronavirus pandemic","purpose"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011). DESIGN Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study were used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants. Participants self-reported motivation, capability, and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS Using regression models, we found that all three COM-B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour. Breaking this down further, the subscales psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour. Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; McKay, Ryan; Murphy, Jamie; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate M; Bentall, Richard P","journal":"British journal of health psychology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Motivation-Behaviour","reflective motivation","good hygienic practices","measure of hygienic practices","design of behaviour change interventions","model of behaviour change","Participants self-reported motivation","UK COVID","social opportunity","knowledge of COVID","pandemic","METHODS Participants","COM-B components","subscales psychological capability","panel of research participants","longitudinal survey study","social support","survey company","UK population","greatest influence","DESIGN Data","greatest global health threats","set of key transmission behaviours","humanity","clear implications","wave","relation","particular need of targeting","recent memory","representative","findings","adults","influences","males","Groups","CONCLUSIONS","early stages","Michie","elements","RESULTS","regression models","cities","OBJECTIVES","outbreak","lowest scores","suburbs"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to explore whether the centrifugation of synovial fluid could influence the positive result of LE strip caused by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). METHODS From March 2016 to December 2018, 64 patients who were diagnosed as PJI or aseptic arthritis and another 20 patients with inflammatory arthritis were enrolled in our study. After synovial fluid samples were obtained, the LE strip test was performed with and without centrifugation. Then clinicians read the color changes 3 min after the samples were dropped and classify the results based on the instruction of strip. The differences between septic and aseptic arthritis patients and septic and inflammatory arthritis patients were analyzed. RESULTS Among the included 21 PJI samples, 19 of them showed positive results (\u002B\u002B) of LE strip before centrifugation. After centrifugation, two samples changed from two-positive (\u002B\u002B) to one-positive (\u002B), which is also considered as positive. Before centrifugation, 29 of the LE strip tests in the aseptic arthritis group (43 samples included) were \u002B\u002B or \u002B. After centrifugation, 16 of the samples yielded negative results. Among 20 samples with inflammatory arthritis, LE strip of 18 samples were positive (\u002B\u002B or \u002B) before centrifugation, among which only 3 samples remained as positive after centrifugation. CONCLUSION LE strip test results could be influenced by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of PJI. Centrifugation should be performed for LE strip tests to determine whether the result is a true positive or a false positive influenced by inflammatory arthritis.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jinling; Gui, Binjie; Cheng, Fangyue; Rong, Genxiang; Tang, Zhi; Shen, Cailiang","journal":"Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-019-1523-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31924233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PJI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive results","inflammatory arthritis patients","PJI samples","strip tests","aseptic arthritis patients","strip test results","instruction of strip","aseptic arthritis group","synovial fluid samples","centrifugation of synovial fluid","inflammatory diseases","diagnosis of PJI","negative results","study","diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection","differences","leukocyte esterase","color changes","helpful method","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","clinicians","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We compared the clinical course and outcomes of iTTP in women of reproductive age, between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related iTTP. A review of all reproductive-aged women diagnosed with iTTP during 2010-2019 in seven university hospitals in Israel. Of 42 cases of iTTP, 12 (28.6%) were pregnancy-related. At presentation, the laboratory profiles did not differ significantly between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related iTTP, including hemoglobin (median 8.4 vs 8.0 g/dL), platelet count (12.5 vs. 11.5 X 109/L); and levels of bilirubin (1.23 vs. 1.82 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1615 vs. 1701 U/L), creatinine (0.61 vs. 0.79 mg/dL) and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer (75 vs. 82 U/mL). The proportions of women with renal, neurologic, or hepatic involvement were similar between the groups. Cardiac involvement was more common among those with pregnancy-related disease (25.0% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.06). The median number of courses of plasma-exchange therapy was 11 for both groups. All the women were treated with parenteral corticosteroids and the rate of adjunctive treatments did not differ between the groups (P = 0.30). Four women (one-third) with pregnancy-related disease had preeclampsia. Two women (16.7%) with pregnancy-related iTTP died during the acute episode (P = 0.07); no deaths were observed in the non-pregnancy-related group. Among reproductive-aged women with iTTP, most clinical and laboratory profiles were similar between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related disease. However, the higher rates of cardiac involvement and mortality among women with pregnancy-related iTTP highlight its challenging management.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rottenstreich, Amihai; Dor, Shira; Keren-Politansky, Anat; Sarig, Galit; Nadir, Yona; Ellis, Martin; Spectre, Galia; Kirgner, Ilya; Pikovsky, Oleg; Arad, Ariela; Dann, Eldad J; Kalish, Yosef","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02133-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["non-pregnancy-related iTTP","non-pregnancy-related disease","non-pregnancy-related group","outcomes of iTTP","cases of iTTP","proportions of women","reproductive-aged women","women of reproductive age","groups","hepatic involvement","laboratory profiles","higher rates of cardiac involvement","clinical course","median number of courses","mortality","immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","precipitating factor","hemoglobin","plasma-exchange therapy","parenteral corticosteroids","rate of adjunctive treatments","acute episode","anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer","challenging management","vs","review","deaths","preeclampsia","university hospitals","Israel","platelet count","lactate dehydrogenase","presentation","levels of bilirubin","creatinine"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS FokI genotyping and bacterial quantification were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Periodontitis severity was determined using mean clinical attachment level (CAL). Regression analyses examined the associations between the FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) and bacterial proportions or periodontitis severity. Effect modification by smoking or drinking was assessed. RESULTS The study population comprised 1,460 individuals, aged 39-66 years. After multivariable adjustment, the FokI risk genotypes (CC\u002BCT) were associated with elevated Porphyromonas gingivalis proportions (regression coefficient (\u03B2) =0.294\u00B10.139; p=0.034) and increased mean CAL (\u03B2=0.130\u00B10.048; p=0.007). The effect of the FokI polymorphism on P. gingivalis proportions was greater in smokers (\u03B2=0.897\u00B10.328; p=0.006) compared to non-smokers (\u03B2=0.164\u00B10.153; p=0.282) and in drinkers (\u03B2=0.668\u00B10.242; p=0.006) compared to non-drinkers (\u03B2=0.114\u00B10.169; p=0.500). The genotype*smoking interaction for P. gingivalis proportions was significant (p=0.043), whereas the genotype*drinking interaction was not (p=0.061). Similar results were found for the effect of the genotype*smoking/drinking interaction on mean CAL. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the interplay between the host genotype and smoking is important in determining the subgingival microbial composition and periodontitis severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torrungruang, Kitti; Chantarangsu, Soranun; Sura, Thanyachai; Thienpramuk, Lalitsara","journal":"Journal of clinical periodontology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.13307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CC CT","CAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FokI polymorphism","smoking interaction","periodontitis severity","bacterial proportions","drinking interaction","elevated Porphyromonas gingivalis proportions","Effect modification","host genotype","FokI risk genotypes","METHODS FokI genotyping","proportions of periodontal pathogens","increased mean CAL","bacterial quantification","mean clinical attachment level","regression coefficient","Regression analyses","study population","cross-sectional study","Similar results","VDR","vitamin D receptor","rs2228570","subgingival microbial composition","interplay","associations","CONCLUSIONS","interactions","real-time polymerase chain reaction","multivariable adjustment","CC","findings","MATERIALS","individuals","non-smokers","non-drinkers","years"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Guidelines published by international and United States governing bodies were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients. RESULTS High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking.

ANIMALS 40 neonatal calves that were healthy (n = 10) or had diarrhea (30). PROCEDURES The study was a cross-sectional study. Results of hematologic analyses and serum concentrations of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), trefoil factor 3 (TFF-3), Claudin-3 (CLDN-3), \u03B3-enteric smooth muscle actin (ACTG2), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and leptin (LP) were compared among calves grouped according to whether they were healthy (control group; G-1) or had diarrhea caused by K99 Escherichia coli (G-2; n = 10), bovine rota- or coronavirus (G-3; 5 each), or Cryptosporidium spp (G-4; 10). RESULTS Across the 3 time points at which blood samples were obtained and evaluated, the groups of calves with diarrhea generally had markedly higher mean serum concentrations of L-FABP, TFF-3, IAP, IL-8, and LP, compared with the control group.

The majority of patients presenting in early infancy have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While awaiting the results of sRNAi trials, the current standard treatment is combined liver-kidney transplantation. Recently, Stiripentol has been reported as a promising drug in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria by reducing urinary oxalate (UOx). Stiripentol is an anti-convulsive drug used in the treatment of children suffering from Dravet syndrome. It causes blockage of the last step in oxalate production by inhibition of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5). CASE We administered Stiripentol as compassionate use in an anuric infant with dialysis-dependent PH1 over a period of 4 months. Although achieving plasma concentrations of Stiripentol that were recently reported to lower UOx excretion, we did not observe significant reduction to plasma oxalate concentrations (POx). CONCLUSION We conclude that Stiripentol may not be useful to reduce POx in PH patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kempf, Caroline; Pfau, Anja; Holle, Johannes; M\u00FCller-Schl\u00FCter, Karen; Bufler, Philip; Knauf, Felix; M\u00FCller, Dominik","journal":"Pediatric nephrology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-020-04585-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oxalate production","plasma concentrations of Stiripentol","plasma oxalate concentrations","urinary oxalate","treatment of primary hyperoxaluria","excessive production of oxalate","treatment of children","POx","current standard treatment","advanced chronic kidney disease","PH patients","combined liver-kidney transplantation","majority of patients","BACKGROUND Primary hyperoxaluria type","promising drug","dialysis-dependent PH1","anti-convulsive drug","lower UOx excretion","end-stage renal disease","early infancy","anuric infant","CKD","inhibition of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase","compassionate use","significant reduction","multisystemic metabolic disorder","results of sRNAi trials","period","ESRD","step","LDH5","larger studies","Dravet syndrome","CASE","months","blockage","finding","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Each radiation displayed similar patterns of mouth phenotype diversification, and included ecomorphs/species of the generalized, lipped, scraping (one or two), and large-mouthed (one to three) types.

This is the first documented case in which numerous parallel radiations of fishes occurred-via different ways-in a riverine environment. Some radiations are very recent and monophyletic, while others are older and include ecomorphs that originated in separate mini flocks and later combined into one. The diversification bursts among Ethiopian Labeobarbus were detected in the mid-upper reaches of rivers (1050-1550 m above sea level), which likely offer ecological opportunities that include diverse habitats yet poor fauna (i.e. lower competition and relaxed selection).

In this respect, the event-driven nature of the Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique, considering its high correlation with the muscle force and the sparsity of its representation, could be an optimal solution. In this paper we present an embedded ATC-FES control system equipped with a multi-platform software featuring an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI). The system has been first characterized and validated by analyzing CPU and memory usage in different operating conditions, as well as measuring the system latency (fulfilling the real-time requirements with a 140 ms FES definition process).

In this review, we aim to decipher the various lines of evidence supporting the bidirectional association between psoriasis and obesity highlighting their pathophysiologic connections as well as we attempt to strategize a therapeutic holistic approach for obese psoriatic patients. RECENT FINDINGS Recent meta-analyses have shown that (1) genetically higher BMI increased the odds of psoriasis occurrence; (2) obesity is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of psoriasis as well as psoriasis severity; (3) obesity is associated with lower efficacy to anti-TNF agents and may predict biologic treatment discontinuation; and (4) weight loss through diet and physical exercise may improve pre-existing psoriasis and prevent from de novo psoriasis. Methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine could worsen hypertension, liver steatosis, and dyslipidemia. Since infliximab and ustekinumab are weight adjusted, they may be ideal drugs to treat obese psoriatic patients. IL-17 inhibitors are very effective independently from body weight; however, they tend to present better clearance rates in normal weight patients. There is a paucity on weight data regarding the efficacious IL-23 inhibitors. Apremilast may induce weight loss as an adverse effect presenting also some beneficial metabolic actions.

As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients. Results: COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure. Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury. Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic. Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury. It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heffernan, Daithi S; Evans, Heather L; Huston, Jared M; Claridge, Jeffrey A; Blake, David P; May, Addison K; Beilman, Greg S; Barie, Philip S; Kaplan, Lewis J","journal":"Surgical infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2020.101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","viral infection","positive patients","non-surgical patients","surgical intervention","older patients","infected adult patients","surgical personnel","airborne viral respiratory infection","appropriate protection of patients","safe surgical care","coronavirus disease","Acute kidney injury","maintenance of infection control measures","emergent operative intervention","emergency operative intervention","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","characteristic severe acute lung injury","SARS-CoV","traumatic injury","time-sensitive disease processes","contagious viral pandemic","hospitalization results","positive airway pressure","optimal patient care","synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining","malignant neoplasia","staff","marked hypercoagulable state","true emergencies","perforated viscus","mechanical ventilation","mortality","nosocomial transmission","Background","addition","Review","myocarditis","critical illness","risk increased morbidity","guidance","facilities","medical comorbidities","healthcare workers","governmental fiat","Methods","populations","persons","elective surgery","Conclusions","transmissibility"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigate whether oligodendrocyte precursor cell transplantation protects blood-brain barrier integrity and promotes ischemic stroke recovery. Adult male ICR mice (n = 68) underwent 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. After ischemic assault, these mice received stereotactic injection of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (6 \u00D7 105). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation alleviated edema and infarct volume, and promoted neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells reduced blood-brain barrier leakage via increasing claudin-5, occludin and \u03B2-catenin expression. Administration of \u03B2-catenin inhibitor blocked the beneficial effects of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Wnt7a protein treatment increased \u03B2-catenin and claudin-5 expression in endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation, which was similar to the results of the conditioned medium treatment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on endothelial cells. We demonstrated that oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation protected blood-brain barrier in the acute phase of ischemic stroke via activating Wnt/\u03B2-catenin pathway.

It is not enough to disseminate such findings through regulatory and scientific channels; targeted efforts to reach patients are necessary. One possible avenue is to collaborate with patient organizations. OBJECTIVES The aim of this pilot study was to explore how adverse drug reactions can be communicated through patient organizations. METHODS A text describing a signal of levothyroxine and panic attacks was tailored to patients\u0027 needs, in terms of language, style and content, with emphasis placed on what to do when experiencing the symptoms described. The signal was communicated via the Dutch thyroid organization\u0027s digital newsletter, social media channels, website and print magazine. RESULTS The digital newsletter was distributed to around 5000 subscribers. On Facebook, 13,820 people viewed the message, with 2346 clicks in the message, indicating an intention to read the whole post. The interactions on social media were positive, and the tone was respectful. CONCLUSION Patient organizations can help enable effective communication of adverse drug reactions to a relevant audience. The social media post generated more engagement than other communications from the patient organization, indicating a strong interest in this information. The additional patient experiences that were shared in the comments on social media further strengthened the original signal and its relevance to patients, creating an interesting feedback loop. The favourable experiences in this study support further consideration and exploration of this approach to communicate adverse drug reactions to patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4rmark, Linda; Weits, Gerda; Meijer, Rietje; Santoro, Federica; Nor\u00E9n, G Niklas; van Hunsel, Florence","journal":"Drug safety","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00932-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social media channels","social media post","CONCLUSION Patient organizations","effective communication of adverse drug reactions","additional patient experiences","original signal","signal of levothyroxine","information","message","scientific channels","pilot study","favourable experiences","Dutch thyroid organization\u0027s digital newsletter","targeted efforts","website","terms of language","patients\u0027 needs","panic attacks","approach","engagement","therapeutic decision making","print magazine","style","content","consideration","exploration","communications","relevance","relevant audience","interesting feedback loop","INTRODUCTION","OBJECTIVES","aim","findings","text","tone","interactions","comments","possible avenue","emphasis","Facebook","people","METHODS","clicks","intention","subscribers","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

It is important to understand how changing treatment patterns affect patients\u0027 lives beyond extending survival. Research suggests that direct patient report is the best way to capture information on how patients feel and function in response to their disease and its treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize evidence of patients\u0027 experience collected through patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in RRMM patients, and to explore PRO reporting quality. METHODS We conducted a systematic search to identify manuscripts reporting PROs in RRMM and summarized available evidence. We assessed PRO reporting quality using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO Extension checklist. RESULTS Our search resulted in 30 manuscripts. Thirteen unique PRO measures were used to assess 18 distinct PRO domains. Pain, fatigue, and emotional function were commonly assessed domains though reporting formats limited our ability to understand prevalence and severity of PRO challenges in RRMM. Evaluation of PRO reporting quality revealed significant reporting deficiencies. Several reporting criteria were included in less than 25% of manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence provides a limited window for understanding the patient experience of RRMM and is further limited by suboptimal reporting quality. Observational studies are needed to describe prevalence, severity and patterns of PROs in RRMM overtime. Future studies that incorporate PROs would benefit from following existing guidelines to ensure that study evidence and conclusions can be fully assessed by readers, clinicians and policy makers.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"LeBlanc, Matthew R; Hirschey, Rachel; Leak Bryant, Ashley; LeBlanc, Thomas W; Smith, Sophia K","journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-019-02392-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRMM","Consolidated Standards"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Evaluation of PRO reporting quality","reporting formats","reporting criteria","suboptimal reporting quality","RRMM patients","patient experience of RRMM","significant reporting deficiencies","severity of PRO challenges","distinct PRO domains","RRMM overtime","PRO Extension checklist","unique PRO measures","patterns of PROs","Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials","manuscripts","evidence of patients\u0027 experience","CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence","changing treatment patterns","study evidence","PURPOSE Patients","assessed domains","prevalence","summarized available evidence","limited window","direct patient report","emotional function","patients\u0027 lives","existing guidelines","systematic search","Observational studies","Future studies","CONSORT","best way","ability","outcomes","refractory multiple myeloma","readers","information","response","clinicians","policy makers","Pain","fatigue","Research","disease","survival","review","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

AIM To examine the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer and explore factors affecting access. DESIGN A mixed-methods systematic review and narrative synthesis (PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42017064874). DATA SOURCES Database (CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) searches (2000-2019) identified primary studies of any design exploring the impact of and/or factors affecting access to specialist paediatric palliative care. Study quality was assessed using The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS An evidence base of mainly low- and moderate-quality studies (n = 42) shows that accessing specialist paediatric palliative care is associated with less intensive care at the end of life, more advance care planning and fewer in-hospital deaths. Current evidence cannot tell us whether these services improve children\u0027s symptom burden or quality of life. Nine studies reporting provider or family views identified uncertainties about what specialist paediatric palliative care offers, concerns about involving a new team, association of palliative care with end of life and indecision about when to introduce palliative care as important barriers to access. There was evidence that children with haematological malignancies are less likely to access these services. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests that children and young people with cancer receiving specialist palliative care are cared for differently. However, little is understood about children\u0027s views, and research is needed to determine whether specialist input improves quality of life.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Johanna; Booth, Alison; Beresford, Bryony; Phillips, Bob; Wright, Kath; Fraser, Lorna","journal":"Palliative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320908490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specialist palliative care","association of palliative care","impact of specialist paediatric palliative care","intensive care","BACKGROUND Specialist paediatric palliative care services","important component of palliative care provision","advance care planning","specialist input","quality of life","access","end of life","cancer","moderate-quality studies","Study quality","evidence base","CONCLUSION Current evidence","young people","factors","children\u0027s views","primary studies","design","mixed-methods systematic review","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","important barriers","family views","Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool","DATA SOURCES Database","children\u0027s symptom burden","narrative synthesis","Embase","CINAHL","uncertainties","concerns","PROSPERO Registration","MEDLINE","fewer","new team","indecision","PsycINFO","CRD42017064874","provider","haematological malignancies","uncertainty","hospital deaths","searches","role","research"],"language":"en"},

Co-localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 enables SARS-CoV 2 to enter the cells. Expression of these genes in the alveolar type II cells of elderly and young patients were comparable and therefore do not seem to be responsible for worse outcomes observed in COVID-19 affected elderly. In cells from the elderly, 263 genes were downregulated and 95 upregulated. SOD3 was identified as the top-ranked gene that was most down-regulated in the elderly. Other redox-active genes that were also downregulated in cells from the elderly included ATF4 and M2TA. ATF4, an ER stress sensor that defends lungs via induction of heme oxygenase 1. The study of downstream factors known to be induced by ATF4, according to Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisTM, identified 24 candidates. Twenty-one of these were significantly downregulated in the cells from the elderly. These downregulated candidates were subjected to enrichment using the Reactome Database identifying that in the elderly, the ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is significantly compromised. SOD3-based therapeutic strategies have provided beneficial results in treating lung disorders including fibrosis. The findings of this work propose the hypotheses that lung-specific delivery of SOD3/ATF4 related antioxidants may work in synergy with promising anti-viral drugs such as remdesivir to further improve COVID-19 outcomes in the elderly.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abouhashem, Ahmed S; Singh, Kanhaiya; Azzazy, Hassan Me; Sen, Chandan K","journal":"Antioxidants \u0026 redox signaling","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2020.8111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GEO","Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cells of elderly","affected elderly","downregulated candidates","ATF4-dependent ability","ATF4 related antioxidants","alveolar type","COVID","study gene expression","work","lung-specific delivery of SOD3","redox-active genes","young patients","lung disorders","heme deficiency","worse outcomes","ER stress sensor","endoplasmic reticulum stress","induction of heme oxygenase","study of downstream factors","Human lungs single cell RNA sequencing data","healthy donors","synergy","beneficial results","promising anti-viral drugs","TMPRSS2","remdesivir","hypotheses","GEO accession number GSE122960","Co-localization of ACE2","SARS-CoV","therapeutic strategies","enrichment","Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisTM","fibrosis","Reactome Database","findings","M2TA"],"language":"en"},

METHODS On February 28, 2020, contingency plans were implemented at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, the decision to refrain from reallocating the Stroke Team and Stroke Unit to the care of patients with COVID-19. From March 1 to March 31, 2020, we measured the number of emergency calls to the Emergency Medical System in Catalonia (7.5 million inhabitants), and the Stroke Codes dispatched to Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. We recorded all stroke admissions, and the adequacy of acute care measures, including the number of thrombectomies, workflow metrics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes. Data were compared with March 2019 using parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate. RESULTS At Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, 1232 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in March 2020, demanding 60% of the hospital bed capacity. Relative to March 2019, the Emergency Medical System had a 330% mean increment in the number of calls (158 005 versus 679 569), but fewer Stroke Code activations (517 versus 426). Stroke admissions (108 versus 83) and the number of thrombectomies (21 versus 16) declined at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, particularly after lockdown of the population. Younger age was found in stroke admissions during the pandemic (median [interquartile range] 69 [64-73] versus 75 [73-80] years, P=0.009). In-hospital, there were no differences in workflow metrics, angiographic results, complications, or outcomes at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic reduced by a quarter the stroke admissions and thrombectomies performed at a Comprehensive Stroke Center but did not affect the quality of care metrics. During the lockdown, there was an overload of emergency calls but fewer Stroke Code activations, particularly in elderly patients. Hospital contingency plans, patient transport systems, and population-targeted alerts must act concertedly to better protect the chain of stroke care in times of pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudilosso, Salvatore; Laredo, Carlos; Vera, V\u00EDctor; Vargas, Martha; Ren\u00FA, Arturo; Llull, Laura; Obach, V\u00EDctor; Amaro, Sergio; Urra, Xabier; Torres, Ferr\u00E1n; Jim\u00E9nez-F\u00E0brega, Francesc Xavier; Chamorro, \u00C1ngel","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Comprehensive Stroke Center","Hospital Clinic","Emergency Medical System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stroke admissions","Stroke Codes","Stroke Unit","Stroke Team","acute stroke care","chain of stroke care","Comprehensive Stroke Center","Hospital Clinic of Barcelona","COVID","fewer Stroke Code activations","care of patients","number of emergency calls","Hospital contingency plans","number of calls","number of thrombectomies","quality of care metrics","times of pandemic","hospital bed capacity","overload of emergency calls","Emergency Medical System","angiographic results","workflow metrics","adequacy of acute care measures","elderly patients","PURPOSE","lockdown","clinical outcomes","nonparametric methods","population-targeted alerts","patient transport systems","complications","median","differences","mean increment","Catalonia","inhabitants","quarter","study","interquartile range","Younger age","coronavirus disease","discharge","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","years","decision","Data"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES A keyword search strategy was developed and used to search the following electronic databases PsycINFO, ABI/INFORM, Academic search complete and PubMed and grey literature databases OpenGrey, OCLC WorldCAT and Espace. STUDY SELECTION Peer-reviewed studies relevant to enablers of psychological safety in healthcare setting that were published between 1999 and 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Covidence, an online specialized systematic review website, was used to screen records. Data extraction, quality appraisal and narrative synthesis were conducted on identified papers. DATA EXTRACTION Thirty-six relevant studies were identified for full review and data extraction. A data extraction template was developed and included sections for the study methodology and the specific enablers identified within each study. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS Identified studies were reviewed using a narrative synthesis. Within the 36 articles reviewed, 13 enablers from across organizational, team and individual levels were identified. These enablers were grouped according to five broader themes: priority for patient safety, improvement or learning orientation, support, familiarity with colleagues, status, hierarchy and inclusiveness and individual differences. CONCLUSION This systematic review of psychological safety literature identifies a list of enablers of psychological safety within healthcare teams. This list can be used as a first step in developing observational measures and interventions to improve psychological safety in healthcare teams.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027donovan, R\u00F3is\u00EDn; Mcauliffe, Eilish","journal":"International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enablers of psychological safety","psychological safety specific","systematic review of psychological safety literature","list of enablers","patient safety","specific enablers","data extraction template","healthcare teams","DATA SOURCES","RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS","identified papers","current systematic review","relevant studies","narrative synthesis","healthcare setting","STUDY SELECTION Peer-reviewed studies relevant","online specialized systematic review website","study methodology","grey literature databases OpenGrey","Academic search complete","comprehensive list of factors","keyword search strategy","individual levels","individual differences","following electronic databases PsycINFO","ABI","PubMed","colleagues","hierarchy","status","orientation","OCLC WorldCAT","interventions","support","familiarity","inclusiveness","priority","improvement","quality appraisal","order","observational measures","broader themes","Espace","sections","Covidence","CONCLUSION","step","PURPOSE","inclusion","records","articles"],"language":"en"},

NOVID consists of a plastic drape suspended above the patient\u0027s head and surgical field with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber. RESULTS Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo-oral surgery (1). Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field. Black light examination of fluorescein treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field. In two prolonged cases with high-speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator. Instruments and cottonoids appeared to be a greater contributor to field contamination. CONCLUSIONS Negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier which appears to successfully keep aerosol and droplet contamination to a minimum. This article is protected by copyright.

However, tumour progression is still frequent, and treatment strategies need further improvement. One possible approach could be to combine different therapy options. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of a combined treatment with everolimus and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in female Lewis rats. METHODS Animals received 200 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE once and/or 5 mg/kg body weight everolimus or placebo weekly for 16 weeks and were divided into four groups (group 1, placebo; group 2, everolimus; group 3, placebo \u002B [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE; group 4, everolimus \u002B [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE). Blood levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed weekly to monitor nephrotoxicity, and a full blood count was performed at the time of euthanasia to monitor myelotoxicity. Additionally, renal function was analysed by sequential [99mTc]Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([99mTc]Tc-MAG3) scintigraphies. Histopathological examination was performed in all the kidneys using a standardized renal damage score (RDS). RESULTS Rats receiving everolimus showed a significantly lower increase in creatinine levels than those receiving placebo. Everolimus therapy reduced white blood count significantly, which was not observed for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Functional renal scintigraphies using [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 showed a compromised initial tracer uptake after PRRT and slower but still preserved excretion after everolimus. Histology showed no significant RDS differences between groups. CONCLUSION Renal scintigraphy is a highly sensitive tool for the detection of renal function impairment after a combination of everolimus and PRRT.

We conducted a scoping review of available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential impact on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS We searched Medline/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and SCOPUS databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease that were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined. RESULTS Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness. Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20% and 36.4%, respectively).

To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged \u226550 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged \u226565 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)\u2020 to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).

METHODS We analyzed potential clinical and procedural risk factors associated with 2049 TLE procedures. The TLEs were performed between 2006 and 2016 using only simple tools for lead extraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed. CONCLUSION The SAFeTY TLE score is easy to calculate and predicts the potential occurrence of procedure-related major complications. High-risk patients (scoring more than 10 on the SAFeTY TLE scale) must be treated at high-volume centers with surgical backup.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jache\u0107, Wojciech; Polewczyk, Anna; Polewczyk, Maciej; Tomasik, Andrzej; Kutarski, Andrzej","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TLE procedures","SAFeTY TLE scale","predictive SAFeTY TLE score","number of procedures preceding TLE","TLEs","sum of lead dwell times","procedure-related risk","increasing number of transvenous lead extractions","anemia","previous procedures","potential occurrence of procedure","occurrence of major complications","related major complications","young patients","risk prediction","High-risk patients","procedural risk factors","female gender","simple calculator","simple tools","RESULTS Multivariate analysis","Logistic regression analysis","treatment","efficacy","removal of leads","significant influence","age","basis","use","CONCLUSION","high-volume centers","surgical backup","METHODS","system","BACKGROUND","information","order"],"language":"en"},

(2) Methods: We analyzed the antiviral properties of the leaves and stem bark of the mulberry tree (Morus spp.). We compared the antiviral activity of Morus spp. on enveloped and nonenveloped viral pathogens, such as human coronavirus (HCoV 229E) and different members of the Picornaviridae family-human poliovirus 1, human parechovirus 1 and 3, and human echovirus 11. The antiviral activity of 12 water and water-alcohol plant extracts of the leaves and stem bark of three different species of mulberry-Morus alba var. alba, Morus alba var. rosa, and Morus rubra-were evaluated.

This study is to explore the efficiency of anti-C5a\u2013based intervention on systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat poisoning. DESIGN: Study of cynomolgus macaque model and plasma from paraquat-poisoning patients. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Cynomolgus macaque (n = 12) and samples of plasma from patients (n = 16). INTERVENTIONS: The neutralizing antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was administered to investigate the new treatment strategy for paraquat-induced systemic inflammatory responses in cynomolgus macaque model. In addition, C5a activation in plasma of paraquat patients was blocked by IFX-1 to investigate the blockade role of anti-C5a antibody in activation of inflammatory cells. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Dysregulated complement activation and the subsequent cytokine storm were found in patients with acute lung injury and in a primate model of paraquat poisoning. Targeted inhibition of C5a by IFX-1 led to marked alleviation of systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ damage in the primate model. In addition, blockade of C5a activity in plasma from patients completely inhibited activation of CD11b on blood granulocytes from normal donors, suggesting that IFX-1 may alleviate the excessive activation of inflammatory responses and have clinical utility for patients with acute lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-C5a antibodies such as IFX-1 may be used as effective therapeutics for treatment of those suffering from systemic inflammatory responses induced by chemical poisoning like paraquat.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Shihui; Jiang, Yuting; Wang, Renxi; Liu, Chenfeng; Liu, Xiaoling; Song, Nianping; Guo, Yan; Guo, Renfeng; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Yan; Qiu, Zewu; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adfc269121799067d9f6d6f7894f12cceb116059.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5908256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5908256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cynomolgus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C5a activation","paraquat-poisoning patients","plasma of paraquat patients","activation product C5a","IFX","excessive activation of inflammatory responses","activation of inflammatory cells","primate model of paraquat poisoning","efficiency of anti-C5a","Anti-C5a antibodies","marked alleviation of systemic inflammatory responses","blockade of C5a activity","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","blockade role of anti-C5a antibody","Targeted inhibition of C5a","Dysregulated complement activation","neutralizing antihuman C5a antibody","Study of cynomolgus macaque model","chemical poisoning","inhibited activation of CD11b","samples of plasma","acute lung injury","addition","critical role","new treatment strategy","multiple organ damage","viruses","clinical utility","based intervention","blood granulocytes","bacteria","subsequent cytokine storm","suffering","normal donors","MAIN RESULTS","toxic agents","MEASUREMENTS","INTERVENTIONS","DESIGN","effective therapeutics","SUBJECTS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","Laboratory investigation","SETTING"],"language":"en"},

The accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal disease is hampered by the difficulties in growing the isolates from clinical specimens and also by misidentification. Molecular methods have gained popularity as they offer improvement in the detection of causative pathogens with speed and ease. The present study aims at validating and standardising the use of 4 oligonucleotide primer-probe sets (pneumolysin [ply], autolysin [lytA], pneumococcal surface adhesion A [psaA] and Spn9802 [DNA fragment]) in a single-reaction mixture for the detection and discrimination of S. pneumoniae. Here, we validate a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR (qmPCR) assay with a panel consisting of 43 S. pneumoniae and 29 non-pneumococcal isolates, 20 culture positive, 26 culture negative and 30 spiked serum samples. A standard curve was obtained using S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 strain and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an endogenous internal control. The experiment showed high sensitivity with lower limit of detection equivalent to 4 genome copies/\u00B5l. The efficiency of the reaction was 100% for ply, lytA, Spn9802 and 97% for psaA. The test showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% with culture isolates and serum specimens. This study demonstrates that qmPCR analysis of sera using 4 oligonucleotide primers appears to be an appropriate method for the genotypic identification of S. pneumoniae infection.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganaie, Feroze A.; Govindan, Vandana; Ravi Kumar, K.

Key points The Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 de pneumologie de langue fran\u00E7aise defines acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE COPD) as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms, basically duration \u2265 48h or need for treatment adjustment. Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO2, SO2, ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. Recommended dose is 0.5 mg/kg on short course (5\u20137 days). During hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. The main interest in non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. During ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment at 48\u201372 h is mandatory.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jouneau, St\u00E9phane; Brinchault, Graziella; Desrues, Beno\u00EEt","journal":"La Presse M\u00E9dicale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e09f21cd27bba39f1934cf29877155845fb4a5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0755498214004631; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0755498214004631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus influenzae","or need","ozone or particulates","EA COPD","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenzae virus","Haemophilus influenzae","virus respiratoire syncytial","hospitalisation","AE COPD treatments consist","invasive ventilation is","cas de patient fragile","AE COPD include infectious pneumonia","During hospitalization","is mandatory","cas de persistance","traitement initial","insufficient home support or absence","increase in bronchodilators","insuffisance respiratoire aigu\u00EB","Recommended dose is","The main interest in","Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD","langue fran\u00E7aise defines acute exacerbation","as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms","exacerbation aigu\u00EB","pneumothorax","respiratory distress","coronavirus","SO2","Key points The Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 de pneumologie","rhinovirus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","signs","kin\u00E9sith\u00E9rapie respiratoire","PM10","Moraxella catarrhalis","traitement m\u00E9dical optimal","PM2","response to initial treatment","the etiology remains unknown","acute confusion but also fragile patients","such as NO2","langue fran\u00E7aise d\u00E9finie","acute heart failure","During ambulatory management","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","mainly infectious","antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent","pulmonary embolism","insuffisance cardiaque","be systematic","majoration des bronchodilatateurs","Points essentiels","treatment adjustment","pr\u00E9sence de signes","dose recommand\u00E9e","hypercapnia despite optimal medical management","bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive","absence de soutien familial","majoration des sympt\u00F4mes respiratoires","thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed","chest physiotherapy","shock","basically duration","oxygen supplementation","bacterial","domicile","clinical assessment at","ad\u00E9novirus","adenovirus","pollution particulaire","Differential diagnoses","pouss\u00E9es","ambulatoire","r\u00E9ponse","antibioth\u00E9rapie","choc","hypercapnie","severity","pneumopathies infectieuses","Systemic corticosteroids should","charge","polluants","gravit\u00E9","variations quotidiennes","embolies pulmonaires","d\u00E9faillance neurologique","pratique","diagnostics diff\u00E9rentiels","exacerbations","oxyg\u00E9noth\u00E9rapie","thromboprophylaxie","expectoration","Presences","prescription de cortico\u00EFdes syst\u00E9miques","short course","r\u00E9\u00E9valuation clinique","courte p\u00E9riode","jours","days","cause","exposition","modification th\u00E9rapeutique","dur\u00E9e"],"language":"fr"},

An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C\u003ET mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C\u003ET mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C\u003ET, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C\u003ET mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eskier, Do\u011Fa; Karak\u00FClah, G\u00F6khan; Suner, Asl\u0131; Oktay, Yavuz","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f439ccbba313098292de9c63daee5a2eb3e9aad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.104885","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["T mutation","mutation rate","common RdRp mutation","common mutations","viral spread","effects of mutations","viral properties","co-mutations","viral genome sequences","evolution of viral genome","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","effects of selective pressure","virus","time","help of thousands","dominance","novel SARS-CoV","Europe","disease characteristics","opposite effect","E genes","China","results","global pandemic","important question","world","COVID"],"language":"en"},

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P\u003C0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms.

Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heialy, Saba Al; Hachim, Mahmood; Senok, Abiola; Tayoun, Ahmad Abou; Hamoudi, Rifat; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Hamid, Qutayba","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/037d22fb58673d6bc09c9d7c0e0512fe85cd5259.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046938","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of ACE2","high ACE2 expression","host lipid metabolism","expression of genes","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","lipid metabolism pathways","dysregulated lipid synthesis","induced obesity","significant increase","host cell","severe complications","effect of dysregulated lipogenesis","diabetes","regulation of inflammation","lung epithelial cells","risk factors","obese patients","increased risk","upregulation of genes","viral entry","pulmonary inflammation","ongoing COVID","viral replication cycles","code","sterol response element binding proteins","completion","chronic diseases","re-analysis","mechanism","mortality","available transcriptomic data","mouse model of diet","pandemic","cardiovascular disease","smoking","enzyme","receptors present","clearance","SOC3 gene","lungs","Suppression of Srebp1","inhibition of leptin","angiotensin","viruses","study","injury","Age","results"],"language":"en"},

The severity and mortality of the disease is associated with a high level of release of cytokine in the patients which is known as CRS (cytokine release syndrome) or cytokine storm syndrome. IL-6 is a type of pro-inflammatory cytokine which release in the severe COVID-19 patients. This cytokine initiates CRS the JAK-STAT pathway. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is designed to bind both mIL-6R (membrane bound receptor for IL-6) and sIL-6R (soluble receptor for IL-6) and inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. It finally stops the cytokine storm syndrome. However, we need to understand that how tocilizumab is bound with mIL-6R or sIL-6R. Similarly, we also need to understand more about the real molecular mechanism of activity of tocilizumab.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saha, Abinit; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Sang-Soo; Chakraborty, Chiranjib","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54bb8f396af21e11291eaaba94e80cbab87b35ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920307827; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920307827?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine release syndrome","cytokine storm syndrome","cytokine initiates CRS","Tocilizumab","type of pro-inflammatory cytokine","JAK-STAT pathway","mIL","sIL","patients","membrane bound receptor","high level of release","soluble receptor","severe COVID","disease","real molecular mechanism of activity","therapeutic molecules","humanized monoclonal antibody","severity","mortality","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Whether regional variations in social vulnerability to disasters influence COVID-19 outcomes and incidence in the U.S. is unknown. Objective: To examine the association of Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of county-level social vulnerability to disasters, and its sub-components (socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type/transportation accessibility) with the case fatality rate (CFR) and incidence of COVID-19. Design: Ecological study of counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 4th, 2020. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with state-level clustering were applied to estimate county-level associations of overall SVI and its sub-component scores with COVID-19 CFR (deaths/100 cases) and incidence (cases/1000 population), adjusting for population percentage aged \u003E65 years, and for comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score. Counties with high SVI (\u2265median) and high CFR (\u2265median) were identified. Setting: Population-based study of U.S. county-level data. Participants: U.S. counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 CFR and incidence. Results: Data from 433 counties including 283,256 cases and 6,644 deaths were analyzed. Median SVI was 0.46 [Range: 0.01-1.00], and median CFR and incidence were 1.9% [Range: 0-13.3] and 1.2 per 1000 people [Range: 0.6-38.8], respectively. Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was associated with higher CFR (RR: 1.19 [1.05, 1.34], p=0.005, per-1% increase), an association that strengthened after adjustment for age\u003E65 years and comorbidities (RR: 1.63 [1.38, 1.91], p\u003C0.001), and was further confirmed in a sensitivity analysis limited to six states with the highest testing levels. Although the association between overall SVI and COVID-19 incidence was not significant, the SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status and minority status were both predictors of higher incidence and CFR. A combination of high SVI (\u22650.46) and high adjusted CFR (\u22652.3%) was observed in 28.9% of counties. Conclusions and Relevance: Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality. High social vulnerability and CFR coexist in more than 1 in 4 U.S. counties. These counties should be targeted by public policy interventions to help alleviate the pandemic burden on the most vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayak, Aditi; Islam, Shabatun J; Mehta, Anurag; Ko, Yi-An; Patel, Shivani A; Goyal, Abhinav; Sullivan, Samaah; Lewis, Tene T; Vaccarino, Viola; Morris, Alanna A; Quyyumi, Arshed A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbed34d38e2e3331df2c16a60734092ef77420eb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060962","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social Vulnerability","Hierarchical Condition Category","CFR"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["incidence of COVID","high CFR","higher CFR","median CFR","Higher SVI","higher COVID","Median SVI","High social vulnerability","confirmed COVID","level social vulnerability","high adjusted CFR","cases","combination of high SVI","association of Social Vulnerability Index","predictors of higher incidence","SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status","county-level associations of overall SVI","indicative of greater social vulnerability","Ecological study of counties","minority status","county-level data","vulnerable population","Range","Population-based study of","disasters","state-level clustering","comorbidities","years","population percentage aged","deaths","RR","percentile-based measure of county","sub-component scores","case fatality rate","Main outcomes","vulnerable communities","household composition","transportation accessibility","average Hierarchical Condition Category","housing type","states","HCC","linear mixed-effects models","pandemic burden","regional variations","measures","public policy interventions","Prior pandemics","highest testing levels","adjustment","Design","Setting","Conclusions","Relevance","sensitivity analysis","Importance","Results","people","Objective","increase","Participants"],"language":"en"},

Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p\u003C.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cyrus, E.; Clarke, R.; Hadley, D.; Bursac, Z.; Trepka, M.

Heparin has found widespread clinical use as anticoagulant drug and this molecule is routinely used as a proxy for the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), a structural analogue located on the cell surface, which is a known receptor for viral invasion.

In this article, previous research is expanded to now include a broader range of GAG family members, including heparan sulphate. This research demonstrates that GAGs, other than those of heparin (or its derivatives), can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor binding domain and induce distinct conformational changes within this region.

In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f739a2568e7a58339a22b0cb89ace39f9127d4dd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588933820300017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588933820300017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deliberate release of plague","transmission of plague","dispersing plague","early treatment of","causative agent of plague","plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium","pestis infection","early escalation","Front-line clinicians","public health organizations","public health responses","potential prehospital treatment strategy","robust public health response","Abstract Yersinia pestis","early isolation of patients","brief review","use of clinicians","severe clinical infection","potential strategies of defense","clinical manifestations","antibiotic therapy","possibility of suicide attackers","EMBASE","F1-negative","MEDLINE","prophylaxis","diagnosis","protection requirements","vaccination","Web of Science databases","current threat status","overview","papers relevant","feasibility","extensive literature search","high mortality","context","culturing","humans","likelihood","westernized country","population","likely pathogens","bioweapon"],"language":"en"},

This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of \u0022COVID\u002B units\u0022. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Lapr\u00E9vote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdd3f9ce27563aaa648b7f25b66e3439d507bb65.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300737; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300737?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","China"],"keyphrases":["health of patients","mental health care","population of patients","acute mental disorders","recurrences of mental disorders","mental health community facilities","mental health healthcare system","French mental healthcare","high densities of patients","behavioural disorders","epidemic of emotional disorders","partial closure of community mental health facilities","experience of confinement","continuity of psychiatric care","intensive care units","psychiatric hospitals","psychiatric establishments","psychiatric institution","medical literature","medical check-ups","medical teams","medical comorbidities","stress management","major issues","barrier measures","hygiene measures","pandemic situation","close psychological support","general population","support platforms","healthcare systems","France","compulsory ambulatory care situations","context of major shortages of organizational","coronavirus epidemic raises concerns","specific case-management","SARS-CoV epidemic","types of major vulnerabilities","possibility of home visits","coping strategies","specific training","regular follow-up","risk factors","relevant results","lack of resources","human resources","severe covid","coming days","infectious diseases","Family visits","psycho-education strategies","psychological risks inherent","infectious disease specialist","monitoring of suicide risk","dramatic experience of famine","maintenance of regular sleep r","early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder","social interactions","physical exercise","pulmonary pathologies","certain number of structural aspects","narrative review","new entrants","internist","prevalence","material","nursing staff","crucial role of information","coordination","compliance","result of stigmatization","local initiatives","authors","diabetes","infection","telemedicine","quarantine","memories","obesity","Current government plans","regions of China","prevention of addictions","weeks","elderly form","beds","wards","total","guidance","Private practice psychiatrists","country","psychosocial vulnerability","dual supervision","urgent need","reorganization","addition","Abstract Objective","World War","directions","creation","Discussion","socio-economic difficulties","end of hospitalization","Methods","article","videoconference"],"language":"en"},

In consequence, natural or artificial sequence changes in viral RNAs may have various effects not only on protein stability, function and structure but also on viral replication. In the last decade, several tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations in structural RNA genomes. Some tools employ multiple point mutations and are also taking coding regions into account. However, none of these tools was designed to specifically simulate the effect of mutations on viral long-range interactions. Results Here, we developed SilentMutations (SIM), an easy-to-use tool to analyze the effect of multiple point mutations on the secondary structures of two interacting viral RNAs. The tool can simulate destructive and compensatory mutants of two interacting single-stranded RNAs. This will facilitate a fast and accurate assessment of key regions, possibly involved in functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions and finally help virologists to design appropriate experiments. SIM only needs two interacting single-stranded RNA regions as input. The output is a plain text file containing the most promising mutants and a graphical representation of all interactions.

Ghrelin has been proposed as a treatment for cancer cachexia partly by preventing AT atrophy. However, the mechanisms mediating ghrelin\u2019s effects are incompletely understood, including the extent to which its only known receptor, GHSR-1a, is required for these effects. This study characterizes the pathways involved in AT atrophy in the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC)-induced cachexia model and those mediating the effects of ghrelin in Ghsr\u002B/\u002B and Ghsr\u2212/\u2212 mice. We show that LLC causes AT atrophy by inducing anorexia, and increasing AT inflammation, thermogenesis and energy expenditure. These changes were greater in Ghsr\u2212/\u2212. Ghrelin administration prevented LLC-induced anorexia only in Ghsr\u002B/\u002B, but prevented WAT inflammation and atrophy in both genotypes, although its effects were greater in Ghsr\u002B/\u002B. LLC-induced increases in BAT inflammation, WAT and BAT thermogenesis, and energy expenditure were not affected by ghrelin. In conclusion, ghrelin ameliorates WAT inflammation, fat atrophy and anorexia in LLC-induced cachexia.

Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. Results Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and lower red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p\u003C0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p\u003C0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p\u003C0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p\u003C0.001).

Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with \u223C1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18\u223C25\u00B0C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37\u00B0C and 56\u00B0C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic.

Objective: To determine socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide likelihood estimates (adjusted Odds Ratios: aOR, 95% confidence intervals: CI) of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Setting: A large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals and an expansive ambulatory and emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Participants: Individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex tested for SARS-CoV-2. Exposure: Socio-demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) factors. Main Outcome: Positive reverse transcriptase polymerized chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 4,513 tested individuals, 754 (16.7%) tested positive. Overall mean (SD) age was 50.6 (18.9) years, 62% females and 26% were African American.

Abstract The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Llau, Juan V.; Ferrandis, Raquel; Sierra, Pilar; Hidalgo, Francisco; Cassinello, Concepci\u00F3n; G\u00F3mez-Luque, Aurelio; Quintana, Manuel; Amezaga, Rocio; Gero, Mar\u00EDa; Serrano, Ainhoa; Marcos, Pilar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f901e6950525b8334494f9c860f2680d691f773.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034935620301237; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034935620301237?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ante","Estas"],"organizations":["Coronary Units"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["los pacientes en tratamiento cr\u00F3nico","enfermedad tromboemb\u00F3lica venosa en pacientes graves y en","hemostasia observadas en los pacientes graves","enfermedad y","los grupos","management of patients","ill patients","complicaciones hemorr\u00E1gicas en","provoca alteraciones fundamentalmente en","Cr\u00EDtica y","enfermedad denominada COVID","los factores tromb\u00F3ticos adicionales presentes en muchos","infecci\u00F3n por COVID","enfermedad evoluciona","Anestesiolog\u00EDa-Reanimaci\u00F3n y Terap\u00E9utica","manejo","SEMICYUC","SEDAR","hipercoagulabilidad","alteraciones generales","coronavirus SARS-CoV","management of hypercoagulability","prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease","haemostasis","infection","interpretation of general alterations","esta patolog\u00EDa","relacionada tanto","trombosis tanto","hipoxia como","sistema respiratorio","nivel venoso como arterial","multifactorial physiopathology","arterial levels","state of hypercoagulability","respiratory system","Esta predisposici\u00F3n presenta una fisiopatolog\u00EDa multifactorial","acute respiratory distress syndrome","distr\u00E9s respiratorio agudo que puede predisponer","adem\u00E1s","consenso para establecer unas pautas","han desarrollado","s\u00EDndrome","f\u00E1rmacos antiagregantes o anticoagulantes","periparto","grave proceso inflamatorio ligado","actuaci\u00F3n frente","Unidades Coronarias","Sociedades Cient\u00EDficas","profilaxis","Dolor","Medicina Intensiva","frecuencia","anticoagulant treatment","bleeding complications","Resuscitation","Critical Care Medicine","trabajo","estado","Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology","Coronary Units","working groups","Pain Therapy","thrombosis","causante","evoluci\u00F3n","Estas recomendaciones incluyen","course","recommendations","Resumen","peripartum","interpretaci\u00F3n","severe inflammatory process","additional thrombotic factors","consensus","hypoxia","actions","need","optimizar","guidelines","predisposition","necesidad","view"],"language":"en"},

We analyze here the occurrences of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, along the viral sequence. Carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssRNA viruses and within the Coronaviridae family, we find the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2, while low compared to other betacoronaviruses, widely fluctuates along its primary sequence. While the CpG relative abundance and its associated CpG force parameter [1] are low for the spike protein (S) and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as HKU1, they are much greater and comparable to SARS and MERS for the 3\u2019-end of the viral genome. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein (N), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3\u2019UTRs of all subgenomic RNA, has high CpG content. We speculate this dual nature of CpG content can confer to SARS-CoV-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different contexts. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG force in the N protein, leading to a loss in CpG content. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP) protein.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"di Gioacchino, Andrea; \u0160ulc, Petr; Komarova, Anastassia V.; Greenbaum, Benjamin D.; Monasson, R\u00E9mi; Cocco, Simona","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd9e8d2ee33bddbcae743fd3507626e68b606e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.074039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CpG content of SARS","CpG-loss","high CpG content","occurrences of CpG","associated CpG force parameter","dual nature of CpG content","CpG relative abundance","N protein","viral sequence","SARS-CoV","spike protein","nucleocapsid protein","viral genome","Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein","high value","viral codon bias","high ability","associated loci","Sequence motifs","primary sequence","evolution of synonymous mutations","binding patterns","UpA dinucleotides","molecular patterns","PRRs","host","trigger pattern recognition receptors","ZAP","ssRNA viruses","outbreak","putative pathogen","infection","subgenomic RNA","new application of selective forces","mutational processes","cytoplasm of infected cells","Coronaviridae family","acute respiratory syndrome","MERS","transcripts","different contexts","seasonal coronaviruses","patients","HKU1","comparative analysis","UTRs","COVID","end","pandemic","betacoronaviruses","immune signalling"],"language":"en"},

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jinghua; Wang, Yijing; Gilmour, Stuart; Wang, Mengying; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Wang, Ying; You, Xinyi; Gu, Jing; Hao, Chun; Peng, Liping; Du, Zhicheng; Xu, Dong Roman; Hao, Yuantao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36521caf90f471c9da1a4e84f8562440d73ead9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["closure of Wuhan city","post-closure period","basic reproduction number of COVID","entire epidemic period COVID","spread of COVID","epidemic risk","Interpretation COVID","high risk of epidemic outbreak","transmissible virus","high infectiousness","high transmissibility","data","China National Health Commission","independent methods","appropriate level of public health response","estimates","assessments of interventions","mathematical modeling study","effectiveness","pandemic threat","confirmed cases","cities","parts of Hubei","subsequent expansion","R0","early stages","responses","severity","Findings","metropolitan areas","Emergency planners","Decisions","novel Coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age \u2265 60 years and CRP \u2265 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age \u2265 60 years and CRP \u003C 34 mg/L; age \u003C 60 years and CRP \u2265 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age \u003C 60 years and CRP \u003C 34 mg/L, 0%) (P \u003C0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Jiatao; Hu, Shufang; Fan, Rong; Liu, Zhihong; Yin, Xueru; Wang, Qiongya; Lv, Qingquan; Cai, Zhifang; Li, Haijun; Hu, Yuhai; Han, Ying; Hu, Hongping; Gao, Wenyong; Feng, Shibo; Liu, Qiongfang; Li, Hui; Sun, Jian; Peng, Jie; Yi, Xuefeng; Zhou, Zixiao; Guo, Yabing; Hou, Jinlin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f854d7b750541d65c48df953a65028a50ce57881.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACP","CRP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["years","suspected COVID","median age","ACP index","CRP","clinical features of hospitalized patients","simple mortality risk index","day cumulative mortality","related short-term mortality","clinical outcome data","negative SARS-CoV","radiological data","laboratory reports","outbreaks","endemic areas","IQR","hospital information system","hierarchical management system","median follow-up","designated hospital","severe pneumonia","efficient management","post-admission evaluation","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","healthcare systems capacities","Wuhan","nursing records","China","interquartile range","key","quicker control","disease","centre cohort study","casualties","Background","days","C-reactive Protein","convenient tool","medical burden","Demographic","Approaches","Conclusion","Methods","Results","grades"],"language":"en"},

Planners, governments, and agencies are scrambling to figure out \u0022How much? How bad?\u0022 and how to effectively treat the potentially large numbers of simultaneously sick people. Modeling the CoVID-19 pandemic using an exponential rise implicitly assumes a nearly unlimited population of uninfected persons (\u0022dilute pandemic\u0022). Once a significant fraction of the population is infected (\u0022saturated pandemic\u0022), an exponential growth no longer applies. A new model is developed here, which modifies the standard exponential growth function to account for factors such as Social Distancing. A Social Mitigation Parameter [SMP] /s is introduced to account for these types of society-wide changes, which can modify the standard exponential growth function, as follows: N(t)= No exp[ \u002BKo t/(1 \u002B /s t)] . The doubling-time t/dbl=(ln2)/Ko can also be used to substitute for Ko, giving a {t/dbl, /s} parameter pair for comparing to actual CoVID-19 data. This model shows how the number of CoVID-19 infections can self-limit before reaching a saturated pandemic level. It also provides estimates for: (a) the timing of the pandemic peak, (b) the maximum number of new daily cases that would be expected, and (c) the expected total number of CoVID-19 cases. This model shows fairly good agreement with the presently available CoVID-19 pandemic data for several individual States, and the for the USA as a whole (6 Figures), as well as for various countries around the World (9 Figures). An augmented model with two Mitigation Parameters, /s and {beta}/s, is also developed, which can give better agreement with the daily new CoVID-19 data. Data-to-model comparisons also indicate that using /s by itself likely provides a worst-case estimate, while using both /s and {beta}/s likely provides a best-case estimate for the CoVID-19 spread.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eng, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f1950d64507dafd2bf16fd530276996513eb24d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091207v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social Distancing","USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["s t","pandemic data","s likely","available CoVID","actual CoVID","daily new CoVID","pandemic peak","dilute pandemic","coronavirus pandemic","new model","Ko t","expected total number of CoVID","exponential rise","saturated pandemic level","number of infections","standard exponential growth function","augmented model","model comparisons","doubling-time t","maximum number of new daily cases","account","dbl","Social Mitigation Parameter","world","beta","Figures","parameter pair","Mitigation Parameters","good agreement","better agreement","best-case estimate","Social Distancing","worst-case estimate","unlimited population of uninfected persons","factors","self-limit","types of society","SMP","ln2","wide changes","individual States","large numbers","sick people","significant fraction","various countries","initial stages","Planners","governments","agencies","USA","timing","spread","estimates"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org, clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 6 SRs published between 1999 and 2018 were identified and included in the overview. The SRs included between 1 and 37 primary studies representing between 140 to 908 patients. All of the primary studies included in the SRs were carried out in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and examined pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or combined interventions. One high quality SR found mixed results for the effectiveness of hand hygiene to prevent infection (2 studies statistically significant positive results, 1 study non-statistically significant results). One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect for personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection and found no statistically significant results for the effectiveness of social isolation. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine \u002B PPE to prevent infection with respiratory illness in LTCF. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that with antiviral chemoprophylaxis with adamantine is effective in managing respiratory illness in residents of long-term care facilities. The rest of the strategies can be used in long-term care facilities, yet have limited evidence supporting their use from systematic reviews.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rios, Patricia; Radhakrishnan, Amruta; Thomas, Sonia M.; Darvesh, Nazia; Straus, Sharon E.; Tricco, Andrea C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/012daf6c5795683b3d82e9b58bf346daa6af4612.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["clinicaltrials.gov","Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant results","significant evidence","SRs","significant positive results","moderate quality SR","significant effect","mixed results","residents of long-term care facilities","long-term care settings","high quality SR","infection control","limited evidence","current evidence","effectiveness of amantadine","quality appraisal","systematic reviews","primary studies","rapid overview of reviews","study non-","PPE","respiratory illness","LTCF","effectiveness of hand hygiene","effectiveness of social isolation","years","personal protective equipment","meta-analysis","MEDLINE","GIDEON","adults","data abstraction","prevention practices","EMBASE","Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network","text screening","antiviral chemoprophylaxis","overall objective","Comprehensive searches","use","combined interventions","Cochrane Library","Methods","AMSTAR","strategies","Title","Background","Conclusion","total","single reviewers","rest","patients"],"language":"en"},

Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design: Observational study Setting: 211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Participants: Residents within the counties (55% of the US population) Exposures: Social distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic. Results: Median case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32F to 53F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53F and 66F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile. Conclusions and Relevance: Social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States. These relationships can inform selective public policy planning in communities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubin, D.; Huang, J.; Fisher, B.

This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Rui; Ye, Chao; Qin, Xiang-rong; Yu, Xue-Jie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46634d03aa169aab9c372746ebaf3aaa65d7c7d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CFR of COVID","true T value","calculated death number","calculated CFRs","number of confirmed cases T days","converged CFR calculation","different assumed T values","reported number","case confirmation","trends of daily CFRs","daily CFRs trends","number of known deaths","death numbers","Hubei of China","weeks","case fatality rate","Hubei Province","average time period","outbreak-controller","pandemic of coronavirus disease","clear vision","timeliness","Dynamic monitoring","Abstract Background","formula","law","decrease","study","pandemics","Results","right","persons","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Results: A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations. The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding. Conclusions: Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torre, H\u00E9ctor Gonz\u00E1lez-de la; Rodr\u00EDguez-Rodr\u00EDguez, Ra\u00FAl; Mart\u00EDnez, Alicia Mart\u00EDn","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22c663b910704db31394f37bfbeea8bdda779138.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120303065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120303065?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resumen Objetivo","Resultados","Lactancia Materna"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infecci\u00F3n en","actuaci\u00F3n en","presentaci\u00F3n y severidad en","y desech\u00E1ndose","Recopilar recomendaciones y evidencias en","recomendaciones y pautas","mujer gestante y","infecci\u00F3n por COVID","pregnant woman","Como l\u00EDmites en","vertical y perinatal","COCHRANE y CUIDEN","practical management of pregnant women","gestante infectada por COVID","gestante grave por COVID","b\u00FAsqueda bibliogr\u00E1fica en","Manejo y v\u00EDa","Las recomendaciones que fueron agrupadas en","specific case of pregnant women","documentos y art\u00EDculos","y Lactancia Materna","Biblioteca virtual en salud","y sitios web y adicionalmente mediante sistema","ya que est\u00E1n basadas en","se establecieron l\u00EDmites en referencia","Resultados neonatales en mujeres","Maternal-fetal control","infecciones provocadas por los virus SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV","recomendaciones para","practical recommendations","datos nacionales e internacionales en ciencias","Control materno-fetal","embarazada","Se detectaron","Maternal-fetal transmission","mujer gestante respecto","Se necesitan nuevos estudios que confirmen","Se utilizaron los t\u00E9rminos MeSH","Transmisi\u00F3n materno-fetal","conten\u00EDan recomendaciones pr\u00E1cticas","MERS-CoV infections","personal sanitario que atiende","Pubmed","los cuales","Medline","BVS","Prevenci\u00F3n","Scielo","Prevention of infection","standards of obstetric care","COVIC","Delivery","Pregnancy","limits","total","b\u00FAsqueda se seleccion\u00F3 como idiomas espa\u00F1ol e ingl\u00E9s","Falta una evidencia s\u00F3lida que sustente muchas","para clarificar pautas","health care personnel","manejo pr\u00E1ctico","fueron analizados","Scoping review","MeSH terms","Lack of strong evidence","international health science databases","experiencia previa","parto","idoneidad","tem\u00E1ticas","caso concreto","atenci\u00F3n obst\u00E9trica ante esta nueva enfermedad","literaature searches","utiliz\u00E1ndose","finalizaci\u00F3n","Forma","Form of presentation","publicaci\u00F3n o tipo","labor","severity","gestantes","Neonatal outcomes","Resumen Objetivo","Conclusiones","face","route of termination","bola","partir","action","order","Tratamiento","Treatment","year of publication","search Spanish","Scope","guidelines","subjects","English languages","previous experience","type of article","nieve","documents","relation","Conclusions","Methods","new disease","Abstract Aim","M\u00E9todo","Results","articles","websites","appropriateness","Breastfeeding","snowball","system","studies"],"language":"en"},

To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization. Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system. Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms. In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation. Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight. Conclusions: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we have identified over 500 symptomatic employees that otherwise would have possibly come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, H.; Dimitrov, D.; Simpson, L.; Singh, B.; Plaks, N.; Penney, S.; Charles, J.; Sheehan, R.; Flammini, S.; Murphy, S.; Landman, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdfd0cfed804d1cee19c1848cb41f9e9564f148b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069211v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Partners HealthCare","MVP"],"locations":["United States","Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["self-service application",".NET application","symptom screening application","application method","dedicated employee attestation application","percentage of employees","week of use","manual screening","COVID Pass","week of deployment","majority of employees","symptomatic employees","custom .NET Framework application","digital COVID","overall employee attestations","week of enterprise deployment","automatic screening","employee attestation logs","staff attestations","manual attestation","symptoms Results","positive symptoms","symptom screening tool","health system","agile development","Partners HealthCare","site","healthcare workers","integrated healthcare delivery system","REDCap","aggregate usage data","log data","time of day","custom development approaches","Massachusetts","day period","manual process","MVP","Office","pm-midnight","organization","Research Electronic Data Capture","mobile device","smaller percentage","agile principles","Hospital staff","Aggregate descriptive statistics","Department of Public Health","widespread adoption","report","requirements","person","web","lessons","access","computer","distanced screeners","Boston","source code","minimum viable product","cases","GitHub","implementation","pandemic","clinical locations","Conclusions","shift changes","responses","design","span","United States","globe","institutions","people","story","Methods","Form","clock","Background","end","individuals","similar solutions","Objective","hospitals","weekday","risk"],"language":"en"},

The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients\u2019 saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19. There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive. Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life. As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fini, Maryam Baghizadeh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c4f7288a2a111a334ca419b9161d60a3642b724.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1368837520301779; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520301779?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["huge COVID","COrona VIrus Disease","dental practice","dental teams","infectious disease spread","Novel Corona Virus","oral cavity mucosa","infectious vulnerability risk","infected patients\u2019 saliva","non-invasive saliva diagnostic","particular anti-nCoV treatment","pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology","future prevention procedure","vaccine","randomized controlled trials","proof","daily life","pathogens","live-animal","seafood market","Wuhan","pandemic","alert","health professionals","guideline","humans","safe environment","China","evidence","transmission","information","world","management","dentists","animals","reports","articles","result","study","ACE"],"language":"en"},

H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km(2) cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC \u003E 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9. CONCLUSIONS: We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections.","publish_time":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bui, Chau Minh; Gardner, Lauren; MacIntyre, Raina; Sarkar, Sahotra","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/965d0f74c85dad6e4119bee49d3026fbb91c80b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5380336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["high risk of H5N1","H7N9 transmission","risk models","subtype H7N9","H7N9 locations","H7N9 suitability","risk of zoonotic transmission","major risk","H5N1 distributions","specific high risk areas","spatial risk profiles","H7N9 prevalence rates","spreading mechanisms of H7N9","refined data set of H5N1","risk modelling framework","high performing SDMs","environmental variables","environmental transmission","south-eastern China","mainland China","high resolution spatial units","animal environment case data","consideration of animal","role of animal","Zoonotic avian influenza","novel zoonotic influenza","virus subtypes","spatial accuracy","study","species distribution models","higher AUC results","chicken population variables","natural environment","human infections","public health policy makers","survivability","current understanding","projections","BACKGROUND","parts","control measures","METHODS","FINDINGS","precision","cells","Maxent","world","CONCLUSIONS","decades"],"language":"en"},

Attempts for a sustainable control of this scourge by vaccination have not yet fully satisfied. With an increasing knowledge and methodology in disease resistance, a new world-wide endeavour has been started to support the combat of animal diseases, based on the existence of valuable gene variants with regard to any host-pathogen interaction. Several groups have produced a wealth of evidence for natural variability in resistance/susceptibility to PRRS in our commercial breeding lines. However, up to now, exploiting existing variation has failed because of the difficulty to detect the carriers of favourable and unfavourable alleles, especially with regard to such complex polygenic traits like resistance to PRRS. New hope comes from new genomic tools like next generation sequencing which have become extremely fast and low priced. Thus, research is booming world-wide and the jigsaw puzzle is filling up \u2013 slowly but steadily. On the other hand, knowledge from virological and biomedical basic research has opened the way for an \u201Cintervening way\u201D, i.e. the modification of identified key genes that occupy key positions in PRRS pathogenesis, like CD163. CD163 was identified as the striking receptor in PRRSV entry and its knockout from the genome by gene editing has led to the production of pigs that were completely resistant to PRRSV \u2013 a milestone in modern pig breeding. However, at this early step, concerns remain about the acceptance of societies for gene edited products and regulation still awaits upgrading to the new technology. Further questions arise with regard to upcoming patents from an ethical and legal point of view. Eventually, the importance of CD163 for homeostasis, defence and immunity demands for more insight before its complete or partial silencing can be answered. Whatever path will be followed, even a partial abolishment of PRRSV replication will lead to a significant improvement of the disastrous herd situation, with a significant impact on welfare, performance, antimicrobial consumption and consumer protection. Genetics will be part of a future solution.","publish_time":"2016-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reiner, Gerald","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5390aefc8bb1a06635a321c0cd82589e2b91c9ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regard","new world-wide endeavour","New hope","PRRS pathogenesis","new technology","world-wide pig production","disease resistance","new genomic tools","PRRSV entry","gene editing","importance of CD163","partial abolishment of PRRSV replication","modern pig breeding","significant impact","significant improvement","key positions","existence of valuable gene variants","key genes","increasing knowledge","challenging diseases","intervening way","production of pigs","partial silencing","biomedical basic research","commercial breeding lines","combat of animal diseases","performance","knockout","susceptibility","disastrous herd situation","antimicrobial consumption","upcoming patents","natural variability","insight","welfare","defence","acceptance of societies","generation sequencing","milestone","methodology","complex polygenic traits","wealth of evidence","striking receptor","sustainable control","difficulty","concerns","carriers of favourable","legal point of view","consumer protection","homeostasis","unfavourable alleles","immunity","products","genome","modification","regulation","host-pathogen interaction","scourge","vaccination","hand","questions","early step","jigsaw puzzle","existing variation","Attempts","groups","future solution","Genetics"],"language":"en"},

LncRNA are found to be present in various immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T cells and B cells. They have been shown to be involved in many biological processes, including the regulation of the expression of genes, the dosage compensation and genomics imprinting, but the knowledge how lncRNAs are regulated and how they alter cell differentiation/function is still obscure. Further dysregulation of lncRNA has been seen in many diseases, but as yet very less research has been carried out to understand the role of lncRNAs in regulation during host-pathogens interactions.

Although preclinical studies demonstrated that TAMs preferentially express CD163 and CD204, the TAM subsets in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unknown. In this study, we examined the expression and role of TAM subsets in OSCC. Forty-six patients with OSCC were analyzed for expression of TAMs in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We examined TAM subsets and their production of immune suppressive molecules (IL-10 and PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three OSCC patients by flow cytometry. CD163 was detected around the tumor or connective tissue, while CD204 was detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD163(\u002B)CD204(\u002B) TAMs strongly produced IL-10 and PD-L1 in comparison with CD163(\u002B)CD204(\u2212) and CD163(\u2212)CD204(\u002B) TAMs. Furthermore, the number of activated CD3(\u002B) T cells after co-culture with CD163(\u002B)CD204(\u002B) TAMs was significantly lower than that after co-culture with other TAM subsets. In clinical findings, the number of CD163(\u002B)CD204(\u002B) TAMs was negatively correlated with that of CD25(\u002B) cells and 5-year progression-free survival.

Due to the lack of detailed molecular explanations, previous studies investigating which features of the pseudoknot are important to stimulate frameshifting have presented diverse conclusions. Here we constructed a bimolecular pseudoknot to dissect the interior tertiary base pairs and used single-molecule approaches to assess the structure targeted by ribosomes. We found that the first ribosome target stem was resistant to unwinding when the neighboring loop was confined along the stem; such constrained conformation was dependent on the presence of consecutive adenosines in this loop. Mutations that disrupted the distal base triples abolished all remaining tertiary base pairs. Changes in frameshifting efficiency correlated with the stem unwinding resistance. Our results demonstrate that various tertiary base pairs are coordinated inside a highly efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot and suggest a mechanism by which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot may persistently act on translocating ribosomes.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yu-Ting; Chang, Kai-Chun; Hu, Hao-Teng; Chen, Yi-Lan; Lin, You-Hsin; Hsu, Chiung-Fang; Chang, Cheng-Fu; Chang, Kung-Yao; Wen, Jin-Der","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81a11c6680ce725535704809655d945cd1d4a088.json; document_parses/pdf_json/42d6a33f03497257ad765977dd53d0c4709e5e77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5449628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA pseudoknot","pseudoknot structure","interior tertiary base pairs","remaining tertiary base pairs","various tertiary base pairs","bimolecular pseudoknot","tertiary base pair interactions","distal base triples","stem unwinding resistance","frameshifting efficiency","ribosome target stem","messenger RNA","efficient frameshift","neighboring loop","frameshift motif","mechanical resistance","translocating ribosomes","previous studies","single-molecule approaches","lack of detailed molecular explanations","presence of consecutive adenosines","protein synthesis","essential process","constrained conformation","mechanism","results","Mutations","diverse conclusions","viruses","Changes"],"language":"en"},

We therefore evaluated the effects of PTH on improving the effects of CD in Early-Stage SAON.

MRI confirmed that intermittent PTH administration improved SAON after CD therapy. Micro-CT showed increased bone formation within the tunnel. Bone repair was enhanced with decreased empty osteocyte lacunae and necrosis foci area, resulting in enhanced peak load and stiffness of the tunnel. Additionally, PTH enlarged the mean diameter of vessels in the marrow and increased the number of vessels within the tunnels, as well as elevated the expression of BMP-2, RUNX2, IGF-1, bFGF and VEGF, together with serum OCN and VEGF levels.

We provide some examples in which rodents have been suboptimal as models for human biology and discuss confounders which influence experiments and may explain some of the misleading results. Infections of rodents with protozoan parasites are no exception in requiring close consideration upon model choice. We focus on the significant differences between inbred, outbred and wild animals, and the importance of factors such as microbiota, which are gaining attention as crucial variables in infection experiments. Frequently, mouse or rat models are chosen for convenience, e.g., availability in the institution rather than on an unbiased evaluation of whether they provide the answer to a given question. Apart from a general discussion on translational success or failure, we provide examples where infections with single-celled parasites in a chosen lab rodent gave contradictory or misleading results, and when possible discuss the reason for this. We present emerging alternatives to traditional rodent models, such as humanized mice and organoid primary cell cultures. So-called recombinant inbred strains such as the Collaborative Cross collection are also a potential solution for certain challenges.

The experimental challenges (e.g., availability of species-specific reagents) that come with the use of such non-model systems are also discussed.

Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods. We conducted a systematic review of English-language papers published from 2000 to 2015. Search terms included concepts related to water-associated diseases, weather and climate, statistical, epidemiological and modelling methods. We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection. Key areas of future research include: disentangling the complex effects of weather/climate on each exposure-health outcome pathway (e.g. person-to-person vs environment-to-person), and linking weather data to individual cases longitudinally.","publish_time":"2017-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo Iacono, Giovanni; Armstrong, Ben; Fleming, Lora E.; Elson, Richard; Kovats, Sari; Vardoulakis, Sotiris; Nichols, Gordon L.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c381a318060a8b093ebc7911198e0b7c509bf580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5481148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5481148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Climate","water-associated diseases","weather data","modelling methods","used methods","weather factors","PBM methods","impact of weather","new methods","control of water","Infectious diseases attributable","distribution of infectious diseases","complex effects of weather","Important data","associated infections","unsafe water supply","bias","exposures","mathematical modelling","TS-SE","non-inclusion of key factors","person vs environment","poor data quality","time series","biological mechanism","environmental drivers","methodological challenges","methodological approaches","common limitations","language papers","text papers","bio-physical mechanism","specific environmental mechanisms","multiple sources of time","important cause of morbidity","systematic review of English","Key areas of future research","human behavior","hygiene","sanitation","healthcare access","demographic heterogeneity","patient physiology","spatial epidemiology","mortality","lags","process-based models","implications","knowledge gaps","clusters","surveillance","order","concepts","exposure-health outcome pathway","Giardiasis","little critical analyses","Leptospirosis","pathogen","disease detection","collinearity","transmission","criteria","Campylobacter","study","Vibrio cholerae","Search terms","individual cases","low-income countries","analysis","objective"],"language":"en"},

CD4(\u002B) T cells and several cytokines, such as the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03B3, are critical in the control of this infection. Conversely, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 has been shown to dampen Th1 cell responses to M. tuberculosis infection impairing bacterial clearance. However, the critical cellular source of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection is still unknown. Using IL-10 reporter mice, we show in this article that during the first 14 d of M. tuberculosis infection, the predominant cells expressing IL-10 in the lung were Ly6C(\u002B) monocytes. However, after day 21 postinfection, IL-10\u2013expressing T cells were also highly represented. Notably, mice deficient in T cell\u2013derived IL-10, but not mice deficient in monocyte-derived IL-10, showed a significant reduction in lung bacterial loads during chronic M. tuberculosis infection compared with fully IL-10\u2013competent mice, indicating a major role for T cell\u2013derived IL-10 in TB susceptibility. IL-10\u2013expressing cells were detected among both CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells, expressed high levels of CD44 and Tbet, and were able to coproduce IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10 upon ex vivo stimulation. Furthermore, during M. tuberculosis infection, Il10 expression in CD4(\u002B) T cells was partially regulated by both IL-27 and type I IFN signaling. Together, our data reveal that, despite the multiple immune sources of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection, activated effector T cells are the major source accounting for IL-10\u2013induced TB susceptibility.","publish_time":"2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreira-Teixeira, L\u00FAcia; Redford, Paul S.; Stavropoulos, Evangelos; Ghilardi, Nico; Maynard, Craig L.; Weaver, Casey T.; Freitas do Ros\u00E1rio, Ana Paula; Wu, Xuemei; Langhorne, Jean; O\u2019Garra, Anne","journal":"J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15d784a335abf0ea0266e9a2406b8d87f25c8f2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5502318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monocyte-derived IL","Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","immunosuppressive cytokine IL","effector T cells","critical cellular source of IL","multiple immune sources of IL","predominant cells","mice deficient","competent mice","reporter mice","Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03B3","Th1 cell responses","induced TB susceptibility","lung bacterial loads","major source accounting","major role","bacterial clearance","significant reduction","high levels of CD44","leading cause of mortality","Il10 expression","morbidity","Tbet","cytokines","control","CD8","data reveal","Ly6C","monocytes","article","day","postinfection","stimulation","deaths"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to assess the efficacy of HA330 resin-directed hemoadsorption (HA) on endotoxin-induced porcine acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model. METHODS: Twenty-four Chinese domestic pigs were allocated into saline group receiving intravenous infusion of saline (N = 6) and endotoxin group receiving intravenous infusion of LPS (N = 18). When ALI model was initially diagnosed, six pigs in the LPS and saline group were killed for BALF and histopathological analysis. The remaining 12 pigs in LPS group received 3-h HA (N = 6) or HA-sham (N = 6) treatment, respectively. Following another 5-h observation, animals were killed. Variables on hemodynamics, blood gases and lung mechanics were recorded at a series of time points. Differentially expressed cytokines and proteins were determined by ELISA and proteomics. RESULTS: HA treatment significantly improved injured oxygenation induced by LPS. HA also partially improved the barrier permeability and reduced lung edema and inflammation/injury induced by LPS infusion. Proteomic analysis showed the differentially expressed proteins between HA- and HA-sham-treated groups mostly belonged to the categories of acute inflammation/immune response, and proteolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoadsorption improved ARDS possibly by blunting the cytokine storm and by restoring homeostasis of the disordered proteome milieu in the exudative phase.

Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs(4). However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries(5\u20137). Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range \u2013 which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of \u2018missing viruses\u2019 and \u2018missing zoonoses\u2019 and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.","publish_time":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olival, Kevin J.; Hosseini, Parviez R.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Ross, Noam; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Daszak, Peter","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13493c8f5f1d8063c462a6fb93e31a82eae2fd26.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e92e2d8ab6aedfa9c7486162c9520e4ea4485df2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5570460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5570460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","higher proportion of zoonotic viruses","human virus","given species","species range","species boundaries","mammalian host-virus relationships","total number of viruses","host taxonomy","human population","proportion likely","phylogenetic host breadth","human-wildlife contact","discovered mammalian virus","determinants of successful cross-species transmission","significant predictors of zoonotic potential","mammalian orders","majority of human emerging infectious diseases","viral traits","missing viruses\u2019","missing zoonoses","phylogenetic relatedness","future surveillance","largest estimated number","patterns of viral diversity","pandemic surveillance programs","EIDs","wild mammals of particular concern","HIV","key goals","geographic regions","spillover","humans","highest value","Ebola","novel framework","comprehensive analysis","research effort","taxa","bats","people","analytical tools","SARS","time"],"language":"en"},

Despite the concomitant improvements in response rate, duration of response and patient survival, reports of serious toxic pulmonary side effects have progressively emerged. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient who was treated with FOLFOX as an adjuvant to a rectosigmoidal resection of a rectosigmoidal carcinoma and who developed respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and open lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonia (IP). She received multimodal combination treatment (acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide) and survived. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed all 45 reported cases of FOLFOX-related lung toxicity and/or pulmonary fibrosis for their clinical characteristics and their outcomes related to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for the 45 cases with available data, the median age was 70 years, and the male\u2013female ratio was 3.5: 1. In the patients exhibiting only mild respiratory symptoms, discontinuation of the culprit drug (oxaliplatin) resulted in a 100% regression of the symptoms. However the prognosis of the respiratory insufficient patient proved to be grim: death occurred in 76.9% of the cases despite conventional treatment with corticosteroids. We therefore urge oncologists and critical care specialists not to limit their interventions to the discontinuation of chemotherapy, artificial ventilation, corticosteroids and glutathione replenishment and to consider the gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents whenever life-threatening respiratory symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients do not subside; all the more so considering the fact that our analysis showed that every patient who survived intubation and mechanical ventilation experienced a full clinical recovery.","publish_time":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Weerdt, Annick; Dendooven, Am\u00E9lie; Snoeckx, Annemie; Pen, Jan; Lammens, Martin; Jorens, Philippe G.","journal":"BMC Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0b6e61b4876fcc86894c0f13587e90af6be830d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5576105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corticosteroids","respiratory insufficient patient","life-threatening respiratory symptoms","mild respiratory symptoms","respiratory insufficiency","patient survival","mechanical ventilation","reported cases of FOLFOX","oxaliplatin-treated patients","artificial ventilation","FOLFOX regimen","related lung toxicity","duration of response","response rate","pulmonary fibrosis","immune globulins","rectosigmoidal carcinoma","discontinuation of chemotherapy","rectosigmoidal resection","clinical characteristics","conventional treatment","culprit drug","clinical recovery","drug cocktail","multimodal combination treatment","open lung biopsy findings","reports of serious toxic pulmonary","gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents","imaging","acetylcysteine","interstitial pneumonia","glutathione replenishment","folinic acid","fluorouracil","median age","years","interventions","concomitant improvements","effects","available data","critical care specialists","Computed tomography","oncologists","systematic literature search","outcomes","adjuvant","cyclophosphamide","prognosis","intubation","female ratio","colorectal cancers","BACKGROUND","analysis","CASE PRESENTATION","death","fact","regression","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

One approach to the development of a malaria vaccine is to target the asexual blood stage that results in clinical symptoms. Most attempts have failed. New antigens such as P27A and P27 have emerged as potential new vaccine candidates. Multiple studies have demonstrated that antigens are more immunogenic and are better correlated with protection when presented on particulate delivery systems. One such particulate delivery system is the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) that relies on coiled-coil domains of proteins to form stable nanoparticles. In the past we have used de novo designed amino acid domains to drive the formation of the coiled-coil scaffolds which present the antigenic epitopes on the particle surface. RESULTS: Here we use naturally occurring domains found in the tex1 protein to form the coiled-coil scaffolding of the nanoparticle. Thus, by engineering P27A and a new extended form of the coiled-coil domain P27 onto the N and C terminus of the SAPN protein monomer we have developed a particulate delivery system that effectively displays both antigens on a single particle that uses malaria tex1 sequences to form the nanoparticle scaffold. These particles are immunogenic in a murine model and induce immune responses similar to the ones observed in seropositive individuals in malaria endemic regions. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that our P27/P27A-SAPNs induce an immune response akin to the one in seropositive individuals in Burkina Faso. Since P27 is highly conserved among different Plasmodium species, these novel SAPNs may even provide cross-protection between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax the two major human malaria pathogens. As the SAPNs are also easy to manufacture and store they can be delivered to the population in need without complication thus providing a low cost malaria vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karch, Christopher P.; Doll, Tais A.

However, these genes are often implicated in several physiological processes, and long-term inhibition of survival proteins might be accompanied with cytotoxic effects. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy relies on the identification and use of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions involved in androgen withdrawal. Specifically, the interaction of the chaperone protein Hsp27 with the initiation factor eIF4E leads to the protection of protein synthesis initiation process and enhances cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Thus, in this work we aimed at i) identifying the interaction site of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex and ii) interfere with the relevant protein/protein association mechanism involved in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. By a combination of experimental and modeling techniques, we proved that eIF4E interacts with the C-terminal part of Hsp27, preferentially when Hsp27 is phosphorylated.

This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen\u2010induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6\u2010week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone. LRF knockdown from either the Plp/CreER (T) line or the NG2CreER (T) line did not significantly change OP or oligodendrocyte populations. In vitro promoter assays demonstrated the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin\u2010related genes and the notch target Hes5, which has been implicated in control of myelin formation and repair. In summary, in the oligodendrocyte lineage, LRF is expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes but is not required for oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions. Furthermore, LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination, potentially by contributing to interactions regulating transcription.","publish_time":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davidson, Nathan L.; Yu, Fengshan; Kijpaisalratana, Naruchorn; Le, Tuan Q.; Beer, Laurel A.; Radomski, Kryslaine L.; Armstrong, Regina C.","journal":"J Neurosci Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9ed744baa5ce70adff087cb1ce4e77afc969822.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5655903.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5655903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cuprizone","Tamoxifen"],"organizations":["CNS","LRF","OP","Plp/CreER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LRF expression","role of LRF","effect of LRF knockdown","induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination","fl","oligodendrocyte lineage","weeks of cuprizone","oligodendrocyte progenitors","oligodendrocyte populations","cuprizone demyelination","Zbtb7a","start of cuprizone","transcription of myelin","oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions","extent of remyelination","mice","related factor","finger transcription factor","NG2CreER","CNS pathology","Plp","Tamoxifen","healthy adult CNS","related genes","majority of oligodendrocytes","control of myelin formation","murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination","zinc","relevant lesion characteristics","diverse cell lineages","notch target Hes5","differentiation","protooncogene","potential","lymphoma","week recovery periods","repair","Leukemia","promoter assays","nuclei","corpus callosum","function","summary","interactions","study"],"language":"en"},

Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP1B1/1B3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1 and FLAG-OATP1B3 in HEK293-FLAG-OATP1B1 and\u2013OATP1B3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50\u2013250 nM, 2\u20137 h) significantly decreased transport of [(3)H]CCK-8, a specific OATP1B3 substrate, in HEK293-OATP1B3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [(3)H]E(2)17\u03B2G and [(3)H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in HEK293-OATP1B1/1B3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (V(max)) of OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK-8 (92.25 \u00B1 14.2 vs. 133.95 \u00B1 15.5 pmol/mg protein/min) without affecting the affinity constant (K(m)) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP1B3-mediated [(3)H]CCK-8 transport. In summary, the current studies for the first time report ubiquitination of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and the apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib on OATP1B3-mediated transport. The data suggest that bortezomib has a low risk of causing OATP-mediated DDIs.","publish_time":"2017-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Khondoker; Farasyn, Taleah; Crowe, Alexandra; Ding, Kai; Yue, Wei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b298992d7feb9dd3d23192572f975abdf2cebc0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5673231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS","SCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FLAG-OATP1B3","HEK293-OATP1B3","OATP1B3 cells","OATP1B3 degradation","OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK","HEK293-OATP1B1","degradation of OATP1B1","bortezomib treatment","specific OATP1B3 substrate","bortezomib pretreatment","dual substrates of OATP1B1","endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1","potential of bortezomib","total protein levels of OATP1B1","HEK293-FLAG","time report ubiquitination of OATP1B1","transporter-mediated drug-drug","OATP-mediated DDIs","ubiquitin-proteasome system","HA-ubiquitin","effects of proteasome inhibitors","proteasome activity","maximal transport velocity","class proteasome inhibitor drug","Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG","proteasome inhibitors MG132","Drug Administration","apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib","vehicle control treatment","treatment of multiple myeloma","UPS","cells co-transfected","current studies","current study","nM","human embryonic kidney","current constitutive conditions","human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes","negligible effects","involvement","low risk","minor role","SCH","drugs","epoxomicin","carfilzomib","pitavastatin","Food","hepatic uptake","interactions","hemagglutinin","statins","summary","\u03B2G","data","affinity constant","pmol","values"],"language":"en"},

However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds.","publish_time":"2017-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stagegaard, Julia; Kurth, Andreas; Stern, Daniel; Dabrowski, Piotr Wojciech; Pocknell, Ann; Nitsche, Andreas; Schrick, Livia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a9f30acc275c64c016770509f9b90eb091e272a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5679633.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679633/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Russia","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["contact cheetahs","captive cheetahs","cowpox virus outbreaks","Cowpox virus infections","cowpox viruses","clinical picture of cowpox","separate introductions of cowpox virus","physical management of diseased cheetahs","zoo grounds","clinical signs","different outbreaks","high morbidity","clade distinct","varying severity of clinical disease","direct contact","reported cases","pre-shipment isolation","cell culture isolation","intra-clade distances","High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers","molecular analyses","Acinonyx jubatus","extensive laboratory investigations","cheetah export","Arvicola amphibious","individual sequences","sample","cluster","subsequent phylogenetic analysis","hygienic measures","wild rodent populations","voles","Sero-positivity","safari park","institution","keepers","care","recommendations","findings","singular events","mortality","total","genome sequencing","clades","animals","Denmark","consequence","hypothesis","UK","Russia","respective year","carnivores","episodes"],"language":"en"},

Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.","publish_time":"2017-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Max S.

A total of 33,079 assembled unigenes were identified in the salivary glands of aphids. Of the all obtained unigenes, 15,833(47.86%) and 10,829(32.73%) unigenes showed high similarity to known proteins in Nr and Swiss-Prot databases respectively. 526 unigenes were predicted to encode secretory proteins, including some digestive and detoxifying enzymes and potential effectors.

RNA granules control RNA metabolism and comprise a large class of condensates that are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and RNA molecules. Many RNA granule proteins are composed of both modular domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) having low amino acid sequence complexity. Phase separation of these molecules likely plays an important role in the generation and stability of RNA granules. To understand how folded domains and IDRs can cooperate to modulate LLPS, we generated a series of engineered proteins. These were based on fusions of an IDR derived from the RNA granule protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) to a multivalent poly-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a poly-proline\u2013rich-motif (polyPRM) ligand. We found that the wild-type IDR promotes LLPS of the polySH3\u2013polyPRM system, decreasing the phase separation threshold concentration by 8-fold. Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues in Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser motifs of the IDR reduced this effect, depending on the number but not on the position of these substitutions. Mutating all tyrosines to non-aromatic residues or phosphorylating the IDR raised the phase separation threshold above that of the unmodified polySH3\u2013polyPRM pair. These results show that low-complexity IDRs can modulate LLPS both positively and negatively, depending on the degree of aromaticity and phosphorylation status. Our findings provide plausible mechanisms by which these sequences could alter RNA granule properties on evolutionary and cellular timescales.","publish_time":"2017-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yuan; Currie, Simon L.; Rosen, Michael K.","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17ef76b6acdc223229e3a6ed236bed4c2fc0f811.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5704491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5704491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LLPS","Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA molecules","RNA granule proteins","RNA granule properties","RNA granules control RNA metabolism","RNA-binding proteins","LLPS","stability of RNA granules","liquid phase separation","RNA granule protein FUS","phase separation threshold concentration","phase-separates","low-complexity IDRs","Gly","polyPRM system","wild-type IDR","polyPRM pair","series of engineered proteins","Ser-Tyr","domain protein","Ser motifs","unmodified polySH3","poly-proline","biomolecular condensates","modular domains","folded domains","low amino acid sequence complexity","non-aromatic residues","large class of condensates","multivalent poly-Src homology","Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues","eukaryotic cell structures","diverse macromolecules","disordered regions","rich-motif","generation","sarcoma","sequences","cellular timescales","important role","degree of aromaticity","phosphorylation status","plausible mechanisms","bounding membrane","tyrosines","establishment","ligand","effect","results","position","number","findings","substitutions","fusions"],"language":"en"},

Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN-\u03B3-enzyme-linked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN-\u03B3-producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8\u2013aa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996\u2013aa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358\u2013aa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 functions as an immunodominant protective epitope that may advance the design of safe and effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines for humans.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Kang; Cheng, Linfeng; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yusi; Zheng, Xuyang; Zhang, Yun; Zhuang, Ran; Jin, Boquan; Zhang, Fanglin; Ma, Ying","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18f3b3f9f77227f4941079cdb605af4e5777c061.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5732971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cytotoxic T","CTL","HTNV","SYFPEITHI","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTNV infection","protective CTL responses","understanding of CTL responses","HTNV GP-derived HLA","epitope-specific CTL","HTNV challenge trial","restricted epitopes","effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines","allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein","immunoreactivity of epitopes","mer epitopes","HLA class","HLA-A2","significant inhibition of HTNV replication","immunodominant protective epitope","humans","epitope LL9 functions","eliciting epitope-specific IFN-\u03B3","virus elimination","kidneys","Hantaan virus","molecules","high affinity","milder HFRS","Cytotoxic T cell","high fatality rates","results of tetramer staining","T2 cell binding assay","nonapeptides VV9","RNA loads","transgenic mice pre-vaccinated","severe hemorrhagic fever","aa8","lower levels of antigens","renal syndrome","spleen","infections","major target organs","enzyme-linked immunospot analysis","SL9","VMASLVWPV","aa16","liver","SLTECPTFL","date","patients","frequencies","design of safe","best ability","prominent effect","aa996","aa358","aa1004","kidney injury","BIMAS","aa366","LIWTGMIDL","SYFPEITHI database","CTLs","study","tetramers"],"language":"en"},

In the current study, 46 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (ND, 5.4% fat, w/w) and one of which was fed a HFD (45% fat, w/w) for 3 weeks. Following removal of the 12 most obesity-resistant rats from the HFD group, the remaining rats were divided into two sub-groups: A HFD group and a HFD\u002BCQR group (administered 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin). The results revealed that the HFD\u002BCQR group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the HFD group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes. Serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the HFD\u002BCQR group. CQR attenuated the expression of systemic proinflammatory adipokines, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6.

Accounting for host transient movement captures key processes that occur while hosts move between locations, which together determine the rate at which hosts spread infections through networks. We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics.

The symptoms typically present with fever and skin rash, and rapidly progress to multiple organ failures. Vancomycin is a rare drug to cause DRESS syndrome with 23 cases reported to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a case of a 39 year-old man who was treated with vancomycin for osteomyelitis of the foot. The patient subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by rash and acute interstitial nephritis. These symptoms were improved by withdrawal of vancomycin and a pulsed corticosteroid regimen. According to the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR) (Kardaun et al, British Journal of Dermatology, 169:1071-1080, 2013), the probability of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was scored as \u201CDefinite\u201D. A literature search of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was also performed and the overall pulmonary involvement was estimated as 5%. To our knowledge, this was the first case reported with pulmonary involvement as the initial symptom. CONCLUSION: This is the first case to report pulmonary manifestation as the initial symptom in vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome.

These risks come from the re\u2010emergence of pathogens kept in laboratories or from pathogens that are retained in the permafrost, which become available upon thawing due to climate change. We here focus on the effects of such re\u2010emergence in natural host populations based on evolutionary theory of virulence and long\u2010term studies, which investigate host\u2013pathogen adaptations. Pathogens tend to be locally and temporally adapted to their co\u2010occurring hosts, but when pathogens from a different environment or different time enter the host community, the degree to which a new host\u2013pathogen interaction is a threat will depend on the specific genotypic associations, the time lag between the host and the pathogen, and the interactions with native or recent host and pathogen species. Some insights can be obtained from long\u2010term studies using a resurrection ecology approach. These long\u2010term studies based on time\u2010shift experiments are essential to obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying host\u2013pathogen coevolution at several ecological and temporal scales. As past pathogens and their corresponding host(s) can differ in infectivity and susceptibility, strong reciprocal selective pressures can be induced by the pathogen. These strong selective pressures often result in an escalating arms race, but do not necessarily result in increased infectivity over time. Human health can also be impacted by these resurrected pathogens as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, which are infectious diseases originating from animal populations naturally transmitted to humans. The sanitary risk associated with pathogen emergence from different environments (spatial or temporal) depends on a combination of socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors that affect the virulence or the pathogenic potential of microbes and their ability to infect susceptible host populations.","publish_time":"2017-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Houwenhuyse, Shira; Macke, Emilie; Reyserhove, Lien; Bulteel, Lore; Decaestecker, Ellen","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c909b293c6b1d3153626a6a5e22b6b3a889d0e87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5748525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new host","natural host populations","recent host","corresponding host","host community","susceptible host populations","re\u2010emergence of pathogens","pathogen emergence","pathogen coevolution","pathogen species","pathogen interaction","pathogen adaptations","different time","resurrected pathogens","past pathogens","long\u2010term studies","time lag","animal populations","Current natural populations","different environments","new interactions","re\u2010emergence of ancient microbes","strong selective pressures","strong reciprocal selective pressures","majority of emerging infectious diseases","ecological factors","temporal scales","increased infectivity","evolutionary theory of virulence","pathogenic potential of microbes","zoonoses","ability","shift experiments","susceptibility","threat","mechanisms","specific genotypic associations","resurrection ecology approach","degree","combination of socioeconomic","sanitary risk","escalating arms race","viruses","effects","laboratories","climate change","humans","co\u2010occurring hosts","permafrost","insights","risks","Human health"],"language":"en"},

After 48 h on ECMO, PaO(2) improved from 56 \u00B1 21 mmHg to 90 \u00B1 24 mmHg and PaCO(2) declined from 52 \u00B1 24 mmHg to 38 \u00B1 24 mmHg. Haemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma occurred in 45.7%, 60% and 8.6% of patients, respectively. Compared with successfully weaned patients (n = 14), the 21 unsuccessfully weaned patients had a longer duration of IPPV pre-ECMO (6 \u00B1 4 d vs. 2 \u00B1 1 d, P \u003C 0.01) as well as a higher P(plat) (25 \u00B1 5 cmH(2)O vs. 21 \u00B1 3 cmH(2)O, P \u003C 0.05) and VT (343 \u00B1 96 ml vs. 246 \u00B1 93 ml, P \u003C 0.05) after 48 h on ECMO support. Furthermore, the unsuccessfully weaned group had a higher mortality (100% vs. 7.1%, P \u003C 0.01) with more haemorrhage (77.3% vs. 28.6%, P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is effective at improving oxygenation and ventilation of patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) induced severe ARDS. Early initiation of ECMO with appropriate IPPV settings and anticoagulation strategies are necessary to reduce complications.","publish_time":"2018-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Linna; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Yi; Wu, Wenjuan; Lu, Weihua; Xue, Han; Zhao, Hongsheng; Wu, Yunfu; Shang, Jia; Cai, Lihua; Liu, Long; Liu, Donglin; Wang, Yeming; Cao, Bin; Zhan, Qingyuan; Wang, Chen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0577bfc182ea9062ae7d4e4c419a84777b734a4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5759204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","IPPV","ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["weaned patients","ventilation of patients","safety of ECMO","ECMO management","ECMO support","mmHg","O pre-ECMO","higher P","Early initiation of ECMO","longer duration of IPPV pre-ECMO","severe H7N9 pneumonia","cmH","weaned groups","avian influenza","average IPPV duration","appropriate IPPV settings","efficacy","rescue ventilation strategies","ventilator-associated pneumonia","severe ARDS","higher mortality","VT","Haemorrhage","PaO","invasive positive pressure ventilation","viral pneumonia patients\u2019 admission","anticoagulation strategies","safety of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","plateau pressure","Family Planning Commission of China","multicentre retrospective cohort study","general conditions","acute respiratory distress syndrome","National Health","provinces","outcomes","hospitals","METHODS","VAP","current application","Data","complications","Evidence","barotrauma","tidal volume","Chinese population","BACKGROUND","cases","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSIONS","male","case reports","FiO","PaCO","years"],"language":"en"},

POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection. IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease. Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown.","publish_time":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomm, Angela M.; Schotthoefer, Anna M.; Dupuis, Alan P.; Kramer, Laura D.; Frost, Holly M.; Fritsche, Thomas R.; Harrington, Yvette A.; Knox, Konstance K.; Kehl, Sue C.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36dce9f7118e056798289b0019752f51e83568d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5760746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5760746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POWV"],"locations":["United States","North America","Northeast","Midwest"],"keyphrases":["cases of POWV disease","POWV exposure","POWV testing","patients","prevalence of POWV","POWV infections","POWV lineage","acute POWV infection","evidence of POWV infection","tick-borne disease pathogens","Lyme disease bacterium","posttreatment Lyme disease","suspected tick-borne disease","cases of POWV encephalitis","deer tick virus","POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay","long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection","tick-borne pathogens","known tick exposure","serologic test panel","tick-borne illnesses","tick vector","concurrent infection","course of infection","EIA-positive samples","non-TBD samples","emerging tick-borne arbovirus","recent tick bite","diagnostic testing","spectrum of clinical symptoms","unexplained neurologic symptoms","clinical presentations","increasing threat","clinical history","United States","lack of routine testing","IgG assay","Northeast","analytical validation","Ixodes scapularis ticks","IgM assay","analytical sensitivity","regions","analytical specificity","plaque reduction neutralization test","persistent symptoms consistent","specific platform","serologic response","neurologic complications","overall prevalence","public health threat","CFS","chronic fatigue syndrome","Borrelia burgdorferi","little information","seroprevalence","effective tool","PRNT","heterologous-flavivirus","Midwest","indirect enzyme immunoassay","limit of detection","North America","greater geographical range","titer","IFA","laboratory","strain","mammals","commercial tests","screen","Great Lakes","years","antibodies","development","IMPORTANCE","antibiotics","areas"],"language":"en"},

The B1 protein of the Red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) was detected in GF-1 grouper cells as early as 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Using an EYFP-B1 fusion construct, we observed nuclear localization of the B1 protein (up to 99%) in GF-1 cells at 48 hpi. The nuclear localization of B1 was mediated by two arginine-rich nuclear targeting domains (B domain: (46)RRSRR(51); C domain: (63)RDKRPRR(70)) and domain C was more important than domain B in this process. B1 nuclear localization correlated with upregulation of p53 and p21((wef1/cip1)); downregulation of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and Mdm2; and G1/S cell cycle arrest in GF-1 cells.

All cases were evaluated, and four controls that were matched by the epidemiological week of hospitalization of the case were randomly selected for each case. Cases and controls were selected from the National Disease Notification System-SINAN Influenza-web. The hospital records from 126 hospitals were evaluated, and home interviews were conducted using standardized forms. A total of 48 cases and 185 controls were investigated. Having had a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for an influenza episode before hospital admission was a risk factor for death (adjusted OR (OR(adj)) of 7.93, 95% CI 2.19\u201328.69). Although not significant in the multiple analysis (OR(adj) of 2.13, 95% CI 0.91\u20135.00), the 3(rd) trimester deserves attention, with an OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.13\u20134.37 in the univariate analysis. Antiviral treatment was a protective factor when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset (OR(adj) = 0.16, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.50) and from 48 to 72 hours (OR(adj) = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.87). There was a higher proportion of fetal deaths and preterm births among cases (p = 0.001) and live births with low weight (p = 0.019), compared to control subjects who gave birth during hospitalization. After discharge, control subjects had a favorable neonatal outcome. Early antiviral treatment during the presence of a flu-like illness is an important factor in reducing mortality from influenza in pregnant women and unfavorable neonatal outcomes.

These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2\u20134 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.","publish_time":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, Hyesun; Elaish, Mohamed; KC, Mahesh; Abundo, Michael C.; Ghorbani, Amir; Ngunjiri, John M.; Lee, Chang-Won","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec29bbff5e2e2eeb4bdc6651a3fbb49441ab2fa0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5889186.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IIV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["pc4-LAIV","young chickens","single dose of IIV","inactivated influenza vaccine","single dose of pc4","immature chickens","day-old chickens","performances of pc4","current avian influenza control arsenal","long-term use of IIV","live-attenuated influenza vaccine","mucosal IgA responses","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","Outbreaks of novel","protective vaccine","weeks of age","limitations of biosecurity control programs","high level of mucosal IgA antibody response","upregulation of innate","cross-reactive serum antibody response","significant protection","selection of novel","range of protection","day of age","current study","adaptive immune responses","serious concerns","heterologous challenge virus","truncated NS1 protein","poultry species","new tools","optimization","eradication","enzootic countries","United States","divergent strains","variant","previous studies","vaccination regimen"],"language":"en"},

As a Class 2 solvent with less severe toxicity, content of residual 1,4-dioxane in this newly developed scaffold should be rigorously controlled when it is translated to clinical use. In this study, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-GC-MS) method and related testing protocol were developed for quantitative determination of 1,4-dioxane in the PLGA/TCP composite scaffolds. METHODS: Matrix effect analysis was used to optimise the pretreatment method of the scaffolds. Then, the procedure for testing 1,4-dioxane using HS-GC-MS was set up. The accuracy, precision, and robustness of this newly developed quantitative method were also validated before quantification of 1,4-dioxane in the scaffolds with different drying procedures. RESULTS: Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was the optimal solvent for dissolving scaffolds for GC-MS with proper sensitivity and without matrix effect. Then, the optimised procedure was determined as: the scaffolds were dissolved in DMF and kept at 90\u00B0C for 40 minutes, separated on a HP-5MS column, and detected by mass spectroscopy. Recovery experiments gave 97.9\u2013100.7% recovery for 1,4-dioxane. The linear range for 1,4-dioxane was determined as 1\u201340 ppm with linear correlation coefficient \u2265 0.9999. Intraday and interday precision was determined as being within relative standard deviation of below 0.68%. The passable drying procedure was related to lyophilising (\u221250\u00B0C, 50 Pa) the scaffolds for 2 days and drying in vacuum (50 Pa) for 7 days. CONCLUSION: This is the first quantitative method established to test 1,4-dixoane in a novel scaffold. This method was validated with good accuracy and reproducibility, and met the methodological requirements of the Guideline 9101 documented in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This quantitative method for determination of residual 1,4-dioxane in the novel scaffolds is a key technical method during its translation into clinical use because this method is an important and indispensable file in the enterprise standard when the porous scaffold is registered as a Class III implanted medical device for bone defect repair, which is used to guarantee the safety of the scaffolds. It is also applied to optimise the drying process of scaffolds and to monitor the quality of scaffolds in the industrialisation process. Further, this method provides references for other solvents quantitative determination in porous scaffolds or materials.","publish_time":"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ling; Long, Jing; Li, Long; Cao, Huijuan; Tang, Tingting; Xi, Xinghua; Qin, Ling; Lai, Yuxiao; Wang, Xinluan","journal":"J Orthop Translat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3644b5ed4c1c0fbf3e59e20f2ac8c5a88ddfd6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5894362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5894362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLGA/TCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porous scaffolds","novel scaffolds","dioxane","developed quantitative method","dissolving scaffolds","quality of scaffolds","drying process of scaffolds","pretreatment method","TCP composite scaffolds","developed scaffold","key technical method","GC-MS","solvents quantitative determination","novel porous scaffold poly","passable drying procedure","HS-GC","determination of residual","MS column","bone defect repair","Class","PLGA","DMF","clinical use","different drying procedures","optimised procedure","days","related testing protocol","Matrix effect analysis","optimal solvent","content of residual","enterprise standard","mass spectroscopy","good accuracy","industrialisation process","interday precision","linear range","Recovery experiments","relative standard deviation","linear correlation coefficient","headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric","lactide-co-glycolide","implanted medical device","three-dimensional printing technology","tricalcium phosphate","proper sensitivity","severe toxicity","indispensable file","OBJECTIVE","ARTICLE","robustness","Guideline","reproducibility","lyophilising","references","materials","Dimethyl formamide","Chinese Pharmacopoeia","methodological requirements","study","ppm","RESULTS","HP","METHODS","BACKGROUND","dixoane","quantification","TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL","Edition","minutes","vacuum","CONCLUSION","safety"],"language":"en"},

Among the causative organisms of pneumonia and meningitis, bacteria are the most common causes of serious disease and deaths. It is challenging to accurately and rapidly identify these agents. To solve this problem, we developed and validated a 12-plex PCR coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method (bacterial pathogen-mass spectrometry, BP-MS) that can be used to simultaneously screen for 11 key bacterial pathogens related to pneumonia and meningitis. Forty-six nasopharyngeal swabs and 12 isolates were used to determine the specificity of the method. The results showed that, using the BP-MS method, we could accurately identify the expected bacteria without cross-reactivity with other pathogens. For the 11 target bacterial pathogens, the analytical sensitivity of the BP-MS method was as low as 10 copies/reaction. To further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this method, 204 nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized children with suspected pneumonia were tested using this method. In total, 81.9% (167/204) of the samples were positive for at least one of the 11 target pathogens. Among the 167 bacteria-positive samples, the rate of multiple infections was 55.7% (93/167), and the most frequent combination was Streptococcus pneumoniae with Haemophilus influenzae, representing 46.2% (43/93) two-pathogen mixed infections. We used real-time PCR and nested PCR to confirm positive results, with identical results obtained for 81.4% (136/167) of the samples. The BP-MS method is a sensitive and specific molecular detection technique in a multiplex format and with high sample throughput. Therefore, it will be a powerful tool for pathogen screening and antibiotic selection at an early stage of disease.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chi; Xiu, Leshan; Xiao, Yan; Xie, Zhengde; Ren, Lili; Peng, Junping","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a562830d55b0d773e1e687e569bf2f5af6e55f0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5895723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia","Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BP-MS method","meningitis","target bacterial pathogens","positive results","bacteria-positive samples","target pathogens","key bacterial pathogens","bacterial pathogen-mass spectrometry","suspected pneumonia","MALDI-TOF MS","pathogen screening","nested PCR","nasopharyngeal swabs","real-time PCR","expected bacteria","plex PCR","pathogen mixed infections","causative organisms of pneumonia","identical results","flight mass spectrometry","hospitalized children","young children","early stage of disease","rate of multiple infections","common causes of serious disease","multiplex format","antibiotic selection","laser desorption ionization-time","specific molecular detection technique","analytical sensitivity","major threat","Streptococcus pneumoniae","matrix","enormous public health burden","frequent combination","Haemophilus influenzae","powerful tool","high sample throughput","deaths","cross-reactivity","isolates","copies","clinical effectiveness","reaction","specificity","total","agents","problem"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Data were used from the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke-Berlin (PROSCIS-B;NCT01363856). NMDAR1-abs (IgM/IgA/IgG) were measured with cell-based assays from serum obtained within seven days after first-ever stroke. Seropositivity was defined as titers \u003E1:10, low titers as \u003C1:100 and high titers as \u003E1:100. We assessed cognitive status annually up to three years after stroke with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - modified (TICS-m) and used crude and adjusted linear mixed models to estimate the impact of NMDAR1-abs exposure on TICS-m over time. Results: Data on NMDAR1-abs (median day of sampling=4[IQR=2-5]) were available in 583 of 621 PROSCIS-B patients (39% female; median NIHSS=2[IQR=1-4]; median MMSE=28[IQR:26-30]; median mRS=2[IQR=1-3]) of whom 76(13%) were seropositive (IgM:n=48/IgA:n=43/IgG:n=2). TICS-m over time was not different in NMDAR1-abs seropositive compared to seronegative patients (Crude beta=0.38[95%CI=-1.00 to 1.76]; adjusted beta Model3=0.30[95%CI=-1.14 to 1.73]). In subgroups, TICS-m over time was not different in patients with low titers (Crude beta=1.53[95%CI=-0.06 to 3.11]; adjusted beta Model3=1.42[95%CI= 0.23 to 3.08]), however, in patients with high titers TICS-m was lower in the crude model (Crude beta= 2.54[95%CI=-4.99 to -0.08]), with a similar effect size after confounder adjustment (adjusted beta Model3=-2.30[95%CI=-4.82 to 0.21]).

To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort; MaastrICCht. We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study population: Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the Intensive Care with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main message: We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, electrocardiograms, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht cohort is, also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national Intensive Care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence.

We propose a pragmatic model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic by applying a mixture normal distribution to open accessible WHO data. We specified a simple joint model on data from 20 countries with number of confirmed COVID-19 infections and number of COVID-19 deaths. We found that the duration of an epidemic wave (99% of total size) was usually between 45-48 days. Using data up to April 6, 2020, we found in six of 20 counties two waves, spaced between 21 and 47 days. In China and Korea the first wave was bigger, and in Denmark, Iran, Japan, and Sweden the second wave was stronger. Lag time between time trends in confirmed infections and time trends in deaths varied between 3.1 and 9.5 days. We obtained a good fit between observed and modelled data in almost all countries. In about halve of the countries the highest peak of the COVID-19 epidemic had been reached until April 6, 2020. Among the 20 countries, it is predicted that the USA will reach the highest numbers of confirmed infections (653 683-802 205) and number of deaths (36 591-53 286). Taken together, for many countries reasonable and up-to-date forecasting seems to be feasible. This method therefore bears a high potential for assisting decision makers to adjust the measures aiming at reducing the spread of the virus appropriately.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nordt, Carlos; Herdener, Marcus","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["number of COVID","number of confirmed COVID","epidemic wave","number of deaths","countries reasonable","days","high infections rates","time trends","highest numbers of confirmed infections","modelled data","high potential","high death toll","highest peak","good fit","pragmatic model","simple joint model","daily updated forecasted estimates","weeks","mixture normal distribution","scare resources","Iran","order","Sweden","Japan","Denmark","decision makers","up-to-date forecasting","measures","Korea","pandemic","total size","spread","USA","China","method","duration","counties","waves","virus"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. Objective We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. Methods Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. Result CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=\u22122.647, \u22122.171, P \u02C20.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, \u22122.177, P \u02C20.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=\u22120.068, \u22121.549, P \u02C20.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient=0.873, 0.734, P \u02C20.001).

Study selection Any prospective/retrospective clinical study on SARS-CoV-2 patients above 18 years of age with report on therapeutic interventions. Data synthesis and extraction Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, progression to severe disease, median time for clinical recovery and anti-viral clearance. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies with 5207 participants were included in the analysis. The pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 12.8% (95%CI: 8.1%-17.4%) in intervention arm. There was no significant difference in mortality between both arms overall (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). The mortality was significantly higher in the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group compared to control: (1.86, 95% CI: 1.38-2.50). The need for mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-moderate disease was 13.5% vs 9.8% in intervention and control groups, with no significant difference (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.60-4.15).The median duration for viral clearance in the intervention arm was 6.1 (IQR: 4.3-8.8) days and control arm was 9 (IQR: 4.5-14) days, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.37).

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Y.; Zheng, S.; Li, L.; Zhang, X.; Huang, Z.; Chen, J.; Zhao, H.; Jie, Y.; Wang, R.; Chong, Y.; Shen, J.; Zha, Y.; Yang, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d9d2d991f124389c82077cd9b54c4bc6556e706.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.23.20026930v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["identification of patients","bacteria pneumonia-infected patients","accurate identification of COVID","CT images","chest CT scans","deep learning-based CT diagnosis system","online diagnoses","China","recall","sensitivity","world","online server","excellent AUC","fast diagnoses","collected dataset","experimental results","accurate computer-aided method","supercompueter","GGO","healthy persons","DeepPneumonia","parallel executions of thousands","ground-glass opacity","main lesion features","Tianhe","great help","Methods","clinicians","human samples","established models","seconds","implementation","tasks","comparison","modeling","doctors","Materials","computed tomography","hospitals","provinces","acute respiratory syndrome","Conclusions","Wuhan","addition","novel coronavirus","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world\u0027s current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning.

The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shastri, Aditi; Wheat, Justin; Agrawal, Sachee; Chaterjee, Nirjhar; Pradhan, Kith; Goldfinger, Mendel; Kornblum, Noah; Steidl, Ulrich; Verma, Amit; Shastri, Jayanthi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e944893123d65b15977114e278b4ecff86576eed.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20060566","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["viral clearance of SARS","delayed clearance","High expression of ACE2","little expression of ACE2","SARS-CoV2 infection","expression patterns","highest sites of ACE2 expression","viral persistence","SARS-CoV2 receptor","testicular viral reservoirs","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2","independent RNA expression databases","disease severity","male subjects","female patients","testes","time","reasons","females","greater severity of disease","RT-PCR","symptomatic patients","protein levels","median age","testicular cells","median difference","female members","ovarian tissue","Human Protein Atlas","negative PCR result","tissue specific repositories","role","nasopharyngeal swabs","reference lab","FAMTOM5","days","gender disparity","household","Angiotensin","possibility","Mumbai","P value","GETx","years","higher incidence","families","enzyme","India","total","multiple cohorts","globe","examination","family","host factors","range","observations"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies showed that patients with previous heart disease, especially heart failure (HF), whose plasma Natriuretic Peptides (NPs) concentrations are higher, were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed single-center case series of 91 patients with COVID-19 in China. 46 (50.5%) patients exhibited cardiac dysfunction as indicated by elevated Natriuretic Peptides B (BNP) levels. Moreover, the results indicate that patients with cardiac dysfunction had higher mortality than those without cardiac dysfunction. Nonetheless, it remains unclear as to how the virus infects the heart, especially in HF patients and why a higher level of BNP in the heart dampen inflammation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses in different organs. Still, its cellular distribution in the human heart, especially in patients with HF remains unclear. Thus, we investigated ACE2 gene expression pattern in single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) data of hearts from normal adults versus patients with HF. Our results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in normal heart. Not only ACE2\u002B CMs, but also expression of ACE2 are significantly boosted in CMs of patients with HF. Also, genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of IFN-{gamma} signaling besides ACE2 were up-regulated in HF patient, mainly in CMs, indicating the higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, NPs are significantly up-regulated in ACE2-postive (ACE2\u002B) ventricular myocytes and share the upstream transcription factor. ACE2 and NPs can form a negative feedback loop with protective effects. But it maybe turns into a positive feedback loop by virus and ineffective NPs, which lead to severe prognosis. In summary, the increased expression of ACE2, NPs during HF predisposes to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modulating the levels of ACE2, NPs therefore may potentially be a novel therapeutic target to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, X.; Xu, D.; Li, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/feec73d9b284320d391dd995db522d38a0ee573d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20081257v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BNP","HF"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HF patients","levels of ACE2","CMs of patients","ACE2-postive","SARS-CoV","increased expression of ACE2","normal heart","ACE2 gene expression pattern","infection","heart failure","human heart","ineffective NPs","previous heart disease","higher mortality","cardiac dysfunction","virus replication","virus entry","higher susceptibility","higher level of BNP","critical host cellular receptor of SARS","COVID","results","plasma Natriuretic Peptides","negative feedback loop","positive feedback loop","endothelial cells","elevated Natriuretic Peptides B","normal adults","cellular distribution","coronavirus disease","smooth muscle cells","single-cell RNA sequence","single-center case series","scRNA-seq","fibroblasts","data of hearts","concentrations","ventricular myocytes","suppression of IFN","protective effects","cardiomyocytes","genes","upstream transcription factor","novel therapeutic target","Recent studies","gamma","summary","severe prognosis","high morbidity","Angiotensin","enzyme","inflammation","China","different organs","study"],"language":"en"},

We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID-19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM). The simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents. Methods: We have built a modified SIR model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data. Findings: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. Interpretation: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siwiak, Marlena M; Szczesny, Pawel; Siwiak, Marian P","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/980e3169b121a9e40ef10a836cd1e749030b57a6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Epidemic and Mobility Model"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of diagnosed cases","observed number of cases","days","Mobility Model","virus","pandemic characteristic","severe symptoms","missing parameters","set of parameters","modified SIR model","multiple countries","undocumented COVID","probability of diagnosis","basic reproduction number R0","Global Epidemic","results","mild symptoms","global level","presymptomatic infectious period","global epidemiological crisis","testing rate","observed dynamics","empirical data","sixeight selected countries","multiple efforts of modelling","actual mortality rate","latent non-infectious period","speed of undertaken precautions","China","effective strategy","accurate prediction","reliable statistics","geo-temporal transmissibility","country","refinement","terms of strength","screening tests","newest research","predictions","Wuhan","GLEaM","discrepancy","confidence intervals","concordance","outbreak","continents","simulation","literature","Confirmation","prevalence","Methods","Background","Findings","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72\u2103 and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70\u2103 and 12.42\u2103 respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1\u2103 increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1\u2103 increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Mao; Jiang, Aili; Gong, Lijuan; Luo, Lina; Guo, Wenbin; Li, Chuyi; Zheng, Jing; Li, Chaoyong; Yang, Bixing; Zeng, Jietong; Chen, Youping; Zheng, Ke; Li, Hongyan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["minimum temperature","average temperature","best temperature","temperature changes COVID","circumstance of lower temperature","higher-temperature group","cumulative number of cases","cumulative number of confirmed cases","increase","maximum temperatures","regions","world","viral transmission","total","significant change COVID","overseas countries","linear mixture model","single-factor model","certain extent","strictest control measures","restricted cubic spline function","China","cities","decrease","future reversal","evidence","study","daily means","curves","similar shapes","Results","Methods","lgN","peak","apexes","Hubei Province","Conclusion","Background","relationships","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

Thus, non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives effectively inhibit HCoV-229E replication suggesting them as possible candidates for the treatment of HCoV infection.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies. Findings Among the elderly (age\u003E65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% CI 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age\u003E65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt\u003C1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt\u003C1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurtado, Samuel; Tinajero, David","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/543a91a00962e3e23102d7e8cf1f1e4d45df5865.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team","ICU"],"locations":["Austria","Denmark","France","Norway","Switzerland","Belgium","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["ICU signal","intensive care signal","estimates of Rt","bias","epidemic","number of patients","number of deaths","number of people","advantages","Switzerland","saturation","confidence","daily demand of intensive care","new ICU admissions","effective reproductive number","Italy","healthcare system","current COVID","onset of symptoms","impact of measures","original methodology of Flaxman et","recent study","European countries","mortality rate","updated data","excess mortality","Imperial College COVID","impact of different nonpharmaceutical interventions","Denmark","Austria","Response Team","Norway","France","Spain","country","terms of timeliness","Sweden","Belgium","sum","lag","estimation","Thanks","components"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Hage, Wissam;

The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate host\u2019s antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maaroufi, Halim","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020941","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Artepillin C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","PP2A-B56","host specificity","analysis of SARS","host protein phosphatase","sustained host inflammation","S protein","B56-binding LxxIxE","COVID","ArtC","acute inflammation","target","chains of LxxLxE motif","S1 subunit","binding pocket","dangerous effects","host\u2019s antiviral responses","regulation of pro-inflammatory responses","acute respiratory distress syndrome","ARDS","main compound","excellent candidate","glycoprotein","motifs","future clinical trials","major players","Brazilian honeybee green propolis","bioactive ligand inhibitor","order","receptor-recognition","Artepillin C","pathogenic infections","S2 subunits","development","therapeutic purposes","kinases","multiple organ failure","small molecule","surface coronavirus spike","key factor","membrane fusion","anti-inflammatory activity","Phosphatases","patients","viruses","interaction","Recent researches","discovery","studies","cytokine storm","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using three assays: a LuLISA targeting the N protein (99% specificity), a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity), and a S- Flow assay (\u003E99.5% specificity). The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. Results: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV- 2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The LuLISA N assay detected antibodies in 129 (80.6%) of the samples, with better performance for samples collected after 28 days (45/48 = 93.8%); the rapid immunodiagnostic test in 153 (95.6%); and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (none of the other tests detected antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02). Conclusion: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff after 13 days from the COVID-19 symptom onset. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fafi-Kremer, S.; Bruel, T.; Madec, Y.; Grant, R.; Tondeur, L.; Grzelak, L.; Staropoli, I.; Anna, F.; Souque, P.; Mutter, C.; Collongues, N.; Bolle, A.; Velay, A.; Lefebvre, N.; Mielcarek, M.; Meyer, N.; Rey, D.; Charneau, P.; Hoen, B.; De Seze, J.; Schwartz, O.; Fontanet, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b6020d44b406b856ea26326d2e1763925050bf9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20101832v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","Neutralizing antibodies","reported SARS-CoV","anti-SARS-CoV","symptom onset","infection","Hospital staff","mild forms of SARS","specificity","samples","LuLISA N assay","S- Flow assay","S-Flow assay","hospital admission","neutralizing activity","serologic response of individuals","rapid immunodiagnostic test","pseudovirus-based assay","recovered patients","mild forms of PCR","humoral response","diagnosis of individuals","N protein","blood sample collection","use of serologic testing","associated neutralization capacity","investigation","median time","persistence","assays","COVID","better performance","sera","Background","IQR","tests","overtime","Conclusion","Future studies","Methods","Results","analyses"],"language":"en"},

This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients\u0027 sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient\u0027s partner was uninfected and the other patient\u0027s partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Pengfei; Chen, Zhe; Wang, Tian; Dai, Jun; Zhang, Jinjin; Ding, Ting; Jiang, Jingjing; Liu, Jia; Zhang, Cong; Shan, Wanying; Wang, Sheng; Rong, Yueguang; Chang, Jiang; Miao, Xiaoping; Ma, Xiangyi; Wang, Shixuan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/111b9a6e91c938696fcdb4cb128b8ae739dbe11c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","vaginal sex","vaginal environment","female patients","vaginal discharge","receptor of SARS","COVID","possible transmission routes of SARS","patient\u0027s partner","sexual transmission","vaginal residual exfoliated cells","patients\u0027 sexual partner","evidence of transmission","anal swab samples","anal swabs","infection rate","risk of infection","positive RT-PCR result","possible infection incubation period","laboratory findings","inquired recent sexual behaviors","descriptive study","clinical characteristics","chest computed tomography","real-time polymerase chain reaction testing","partners","cervix tissues","human protein atlas","intimate contacts","gynecologic history","Tongji Hospital","age range","lack of ACE2 expression","Conclusion","diagnosis","chronic diseases","people","deaths","China","results","virus","countries","order","Background","Methods","years"],"language":"en"},

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a \u201Clockdown\u201D was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. Interpretation: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarvis, Christopher I; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Gimma, Amy; Prem, Kiesha; Klepac, Petra; Rubin, G James; Edmunds, W John","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31fb22d877d6efa55e7c8261a59a1f0d35962829.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of physical distancing measures","physical contacts","different physical distancing measures","reproduction number","lockdown","unprecedented physical distancing policies","contact levels","types of contact","patterns of social contact","measured contact patterns","average daily number of contacts","average number of secondary cases","UK public","substantial impact","R0","location of contacts","representative sample of UK adults","projected decline","significant delays","behavioural change","previous day","non-epidemic period","meta-analysis of published estimates","consequence","routine epidemiological surveillance","infection","countries","rapid assessment","adherence","onset of symptomatic disease","hospitalisation","interventions","coming weeks","reduction","participant","intimacy","Interpretation","confidence interval","questionnaire","Methods","incidence","place","spread of COVID","addition","events","Background","surveys","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1\u002B macrophages, whereas notFABP4\u002B alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS.

In the context of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments. The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease. Meanwhile, serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, justifying to limit its prescription, and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roustit, Matthieu; Guilhaumou, Romain; Molimard, Mathieu; Drici, Milou; Laporte, Silvy; Montastruc, Jean-Louis","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69e1b549b40d2dd1e67b5f138ed143f5618aedec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720301001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720301001?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drugs","clinical studies","low-quality studies","effect of hydroxychloroquine","preliminary studies","clinical benefits","exposing patients","well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine","specific setting of COVID","serious adverse drug reactions","therapeutic drug monitoring","completion of good quality clinical trials","main risk","increased risk","media announcements","considerable media","widespread use","uncontrolled use","rigorous trials","chloroquine hype","Summary Chloroquine","context of emergency","novel coronavirus disease","virus responsible","recommendation risks","fears of massive","epidemic","activity","SARS-Cov","absence of evidence","loss of opportunity","replication of certain coronaviruses","reliable data","prescription","efficacy","waste of resources","major methodological weaknesses","addition","possible treatments","implementation","results","order"],"language":"en"},

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. Objective: To find out the risk factors associated with mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence. Design: A negative binomial design was applied to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 on April 15, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-variant cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to April 15, 2020. Setting: United States Participants: COVID-19 patients in various counties of the United States from March 1 to April 15, 2020. Measurements: The county-level cumulative confirmed cases and mortality of COVID-19. Results. 2692 infected counties were assigned into three classes where the mild, moderate, and severe prevalence of infections were identified, respectively. Several risk factors are significantly associated with the mortality of COVID-19, where Hispanic (0.024, P=0.002), female (0.253, P=0.027), elder (0.218, P=0.017) and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander (2.032, P=0.027) individuals are more vulnerable to the mortality of COVID-19. More locations open to exercise (0.030, P=0.004), higher levels of air pollution (0.184, P=0.044), and segregation between non-White and White increased the mortality rate.

The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained. Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults. Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milne, George J; Xie, Simon","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11ca9a2c809a5ff5401bbd5e16a2742b5d4d9bd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20040055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":["China","Australia"],"keyphrases":["social distancing interventions","alternative social distancing strategies","effectiveness of social distancing strategies","strong social distancing intervention strategies","range of social distancing measures","duration of strong social distancing measures","epidemic peak","weaker strategies","effective single intervention","community model","increased case isolation","lengthening outbreak duration","COVID19 transmission data","peak daily infection rate","maximum daily case numbers","outbreak source","control transmission","model generated data","index case arrivals","Simulation of virus transmission","epidemic curve","established individual based simulation model","activation of containment measures","rate of growth","population willingness","percent of children","infection history","percent of adults","community contact reduction","health care system","World Health Organisation","novel coronavirus COVID19","consequential pressure","workplace non-attendance","school closure","China","city of Newcastle","Hubei Province","baseline","Interpretation","absence","cases","magnitude","weeks","strategy","application","Australia","Methods","ability of countries","worldwide spread","vaccine","Findings","time infected","society","Questions","Tradeoffs"],"language":"en"},

In conclusion, the reduction of CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, and CD8\u002B T-cells is related to the severity of COVID-19 and dynamic detection of these T-lymphocyte subsets may help predict the outcome of the patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Dong, X.; Zhang, B.; Yang, X.; Li, Z.; Wang, X.; Zuo, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e671130963eb7f8e0bf2c91caefffb2522a8c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20086421v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","moderate patients","mild patients","Severe COVID","T-cells","T cells","CD4","severity of COVID","CD8","counts of CD3","T-lymphocyte subsets","reduction of CD3","counts of lymphocytes","absolute counts","comparable levels","worse clinical outcomes","serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers","CRP","PCT","dynamic detection","AUC","IL6","potential values","laboratory data","admission","ROC analysis","contrast","conclusion","present study","effective indicators","disease","recovery"],"language":"en"},

Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. Method In this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. Results A total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. Conclusions Although randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, M.; Li, M.; Xiao, F.; Liang, J.; Pang, P.; Tang, T.; Liu, S.; Chen, B.; Shu, J.; You, Y.; Li, Y.; Tang, M.; Zhou, J.; Jiang, G.; Xiang, J.; Hong, W.; He, S.; Wang, Z.; Feng, J.; Lin, C.; Ye, Y.; Wu, Z.; Zhong, B.; Sun, R.; Hong, Z.; Liu, J.; Chen, H.; Wang, X.; Li, Z.; Pei, D.; Tian, L.; Xia, J.; Jiang, S.; Zhong, N.; Shan, H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20081059v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["safety of chloroquine","efficacy of chloroquine","chloroquine treatment","chloroquine phosphate","chloroquine group","non-chloroquine therapy","patients older","proportion of patients","Eligible patients","undetectable viral RNA","COVID","half dose","serious adverse events","hospitalization time","duration of fever","median time","lower rate of adverse events","historical controls","CI","pandemic","confirmed SARS-CoV","multicenter prospective observational study","cost-effective therapy","hospitals","infection","years old","absolute difference","Guangdong","critical cases","medians","geometric mean ratio","evidence","different doses","days","evaluation","Method","primary endpoint","randomised trials","Hubei Provinces","Secondary outcomes","total","antiviral effect","Background Effective therapies","coronavirus","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The accumulated numbers of COVID-19 cases (per 1 million population) were well explained by a simple regression model. The explanatory power (R2) of the model increased up to \u003E 70% in April 2020 as the COVID-19 spread progressed. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility largely explained the variance of the COVID-19 cases (per 1 million population), and their explanatory power improved as the pandemic progressed; the relative importance of host mobility and host susceptibility have been greater than that of climate. The number of days from outbreak onset showed greater explanatory power in the earlier stages of COVID-19 spread but rapidly lost its influence. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific susceptibility.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named \u0022epidemic trend index\u0022, which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 2003 to verify the practicability of the new index, which shows that the index is acceptable. The epidemic trend index was then applied to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis in China. The results show that during the epidemic, the trend direction of different districts of China changed on different date. In the whole country and in Hubei Province alone, the epidemic reached the peak on February 9. While the peak appeared earlier, i.e. on February 5 in other provinces. It indicated that decisive outbreak control measures of the Chinese government are effective. While local governments should adjust management measures based on local risk level of epidemic. Although the epidemic has eased since late February, continued efforts in epidemic control are still needed to accelerate the end of the epidemic in China. However, the global COVID-19 epidemic outside China continues to expand as indicated by the epidemic trend index we proposed. In order to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic, people all over the world should work together and governments of all countries should take efficient measures in the light of China\u0027s experience and according to national circumstances and local conditions.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Yun-ting; He, Hao; Zhai, Jing; Wang, Xiao-jin; Wang, Bing-shun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0507aad7c4c76262bd354434b356e8d1cd823ccd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20027730","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["epidemic trend index","epidemic situation","epidemic analysis","epidemic control decision","SARS epidemic data","local risk level of epidemic","new index","new cases","evolutionary trend","trend direction of different districts of China","pneumonia outbreak","decisive outbreak control measures","local governments","global COVID","sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases","management measures","efficient measures","local conditions","Common symptoms of COVID","laboratory","deaths","country","peak","novel coronavirus pandemic","different date","inconsistent results","Chinese government","national circumstances","light of China\u0027s experience","fever","Hong Kong","fatigue","people","continued efforts","LMA","dry cough","average of log","history","Traditional models","world","countries","Hubei Province","practicability","processes","Wuhan","day","order","total","evidence","provinces"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases.

The precise role of TCF7L2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in adult adipocytes remains to be defined. Here, we aim to investigate how changes in TCF7L2 expression in mature adipocytes affect glucose homeostasis. Tcf7l2 was selectively ablated from mature adipocytes in C57BL/6J mice using an adiponectin promoter-driven Cre recombinase to recombine alleles floxed at exon 1 of the Tcf7l2 gene. Mice lacking Tcf7l2 in mature adipocytes displayed normal body weight. Male mice exhibited normal glucose homeostasis at eight weeks of age. Male heterozygote knockout mice (aTCF7L2het) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (AUC increased 1.14 \u00B1 0.04 -fold, p=0.03), as assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, and changes in fat mass at 16 weeks (increased by 1.4 \u00B1 0.09-fold, p=0.007). Homozygote knockout mice exhibited impaired oral glucose tolerance at 16 weeks of age (AUC increased 2.15 \u00B1 0.15-fold, p=0.0001). Islets of Langerhans exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro (decreased 0.54 \u00B1 0.13-fold aTCF7L2KO vs control, p=0.02), but no changes in in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Female mice in which one or two alleles of the Tcf7l2 gene was knocked out in adipocytes displayed no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lowered in knockout mice (decreased 0.57 \u00B1 0.03-fold and 0.41 \u00B1 0.12-fold, p=0.04 and p=0.002, respectively), whilst plasma free fatty acids and Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 circulating levels were increased by 1.27 \u00B1 0.07 and 1.78 \u00B1 0.32-fold, respectively (p=0.05 and p=0.03). Mice with biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion exposed to high fat diet for 9 weeks exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (p=0.003 at 15 min after glucose injection) which was associated with reduced in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (decreased 0.51 \u00B1 0.03-fold, p=0.02). Thus, our data indicate that loss of Tcf7l2 gene expression in adipocytes leads to impairments on metabolic responses which are dependent on gender, age and nutritional status. Our findings further illuminate the role of TCF7L2 in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen-Tu, Marie-Sophie; Martinez-Sanchez, Aida; Leclerc, Isabelle; Rutter, Guy A.; da Silva Xavier, Gabriela","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8173d89781dddb24808cb36f622e968f2f83913.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102384","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fatty Acid Binding Protein"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impaired glucose tolerance","glucose injection","TCF7L2 expression","normal glucose homeostasis","impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion","impaired oral glucose tolerance","maintenance of glucose homeostasis","intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test","mature adipocytes","J mice","Female mice","precise role of TCF7L2","loss of Tcf7l2 gene expression","changes","Homozygote knockout mice","biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion","adult adipocytes","weeks of age","Male heterozygote knockout mice","insulin sensitivity","fold aTCF7L2KO vs control","alleles","AUC","Plasma levels of glucagon","plasma free fatty acids","fat mass","circulating levels","high fat diet","normal body weight","Fatty Acid Binding Protein","aTCF7L2het","Wnt","gender","impairments","adiponectin promoter-driven Cre recombinase","beta-catenin signalling pathway","lipid metabolism","metabolic responses","gastric inhibitory polypeptide","downstream effector","exon","C57BL","Islets of Langerhans","nutritional status","adipocyte development","data","findings","Transcription factor"],"language":"en"},

This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Einian, Majid; Tabarraei, Hamid Reza","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a72eb71c52e09958599184d24d54f833540723.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["health system","global health","effective policy","number of unidentified cases","fragile health infrastructure","effective social distancing","pandemic","unidentified infected cases","estimation of number","alternative policy","note","countries","effectiveness of different policy responses","world\u0027s economy","slow responses","asymptomatic individuals","ill-preparedness","unseen","crisis","population","shortage of protective equipment","large portion","extensive testing","instances","extended period of time","Spanish flu","ongoing economic troubles","Iran","circumstances","various scenarios","impact of COVID","reported numbers","model","results","lives"],"language":"en"},

Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, CD4\u002B T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4\u002B T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4\u002B T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4\u002B T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4\u002B T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic \u0022common cold\u0022 coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4\u002B T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braun, Julian; Loyal, Lucie; Frentsch, Marco; Wendisch, Daniel; Georg, Philipp; Kurth, Florian; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Dingeldey, Manuela; Kruse, Beate; Fauchere, Florent; Baysal, Emre; Mangold, Maike; Henze, Larissa; Lauster, Roland; Mall, Marcus; Beyer, Kirsten; Roehmel, Jobst; Schmitz, Juergen; Miltenyi, Stefan; Mueller, Marcel A; Witzenrath, Martin; Suttorp, Norbert; Kern, Florian; Reimer, Ulf; Wenschuh, Holger; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor M; Giesecke-Thiel, Claudia; Sander, Leif-Erik; Thiel, Andreas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reactive T cells","patients S-reactive CD4","healthy donors S-reactive CD4","characterization of SARS","presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV","reactive T cell responses","presence of S","COVID","seronegative healthy donors","S2 subunit of S","C-terminal parts of S","cellular immune responses","role of host immune responses","spike glycoprotein","acute respiratory failure","N-terminal","unfolding pandemic","high variability","higher homology","cytoplasmic peptide","fusion peptide","transmembrane domain","characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity","larger scale prospective cohort studies","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","large scale testing","glycoprotein of human endemic","receptor-binding domain","co-expressed higher levels of CD38","critical tools","depth epitope mapping","death2","viral clearance","overwhelming health care systems worldwide1","HLA-DR","underlying physiological conditions","coronaviruses","mechanisms","involvement","CP","adaptation of containment methods","virus-disease","asymptomatic infection","direct detection","mechanistic understanding","peripheral blood","pathogenesis","key","FP","positive outcomes3","Clinical manifestations of Corona","lower frequencies","vaccine development","RBD","TM","assay","correlate of protection","pathology","activation","Results","Cterminal","study"],"language":"en"},

Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated. Methods We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts. Results Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases. Conclusions In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Lei; Liu, Dan; Liao, Xin-long; Wu, Xian-bo; Jing, Qin-long; Zheng, Jia-zhen; Liu, Fang-hua; Yang, Shi-gui; Bi, Bi; Li, Zhi-hao; Liu, Jian-ping; Song, Wei-qi; Zhu, Wei; Wang, Zheng-he; Zhang, Xi-ru; Chen, Pei-liang; Liu, Hua-min; Cheng, Xin; Cai, Miao-chun; Huang, Qing-mei; Yang, Pei; Yang, Xin-fen; Huang, Zhi-gang; Tang, Jin-ling; Ma, Yu; Mao, Chen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["severe cases","Secondary cases","critical cases","critical source cases","infection of close contacts","severity of source cases","household contacts","closes contacts","clinical characteristics of confirmed cases","infection of COVID","years","increased risk of infection","risk of transmission","different modes of contact","risk factors","Guangzhou","incidence of COVID","proportion of asymptomatic","mild infections account","median age","increase of age","main transmission mode","laboratory testing","half","Wuhan","data","Background Rapid spread of SARS","heightened surveillance","common symptoms","logistic regression analysis","Manifestation of expectoration","sensitivity of throat swab","Conclusions","increasing trend","China","males","quarantine period","Results","Methods","PCR test"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of viral diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Clinical Trials Registries, CNKI, Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and Preprint Servers through April 4, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ against viral infection. We analyzed pooled data on the overall efficacy, the relative risks over the placebo, and the prevalence of adverse events. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was also performed to evaluate the random errors in the meta-analysis. Potential moderators of drug-placebo efficacy differences were analyzed by meta-regression. Results: The analysis included 11 RCTs with 2613 adult patients. Both the plasma viral load (standard mean difference: 0.29, 95% CI: -1.19 - 1.76, P = 0.70) and the improvement of clinical symptoms (odds ratio: 2.36, 95% CI: 0.81 - 6.92, P = 0.11) were not different between the intervention and placebo arm. There was significant heterogeneity for the efficacy assessment, which was primarily explained by the age of patients and the sample size. Compared to the placebo, CQ and HCQ had increased risk of mild adverse events (risk ratio: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.35 - 1.70, P \u003C 0.05, TSA adjusted 95% CI: 1.31 - 2.19), which were statistically significant in nervous, integumentary, and gastrointestinal systems. The most common adverse events were observed in the nervous system, with the pooled prevalence of 31.4% (95% CI: 10.5% - 56.7%). Conclusions: Insufficient data were available to support the antiviral efficacy of CQ and HCQ due to the high heterogeneity caused by the age of patients. Mild side effects are expected for the current antiviral dose regimens of CQ and HCQ. Treatment outcomes may be enhanced by better-selected patients based on age and well-controlled adverse events.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Yu, L.; Li, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.13.20064295v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CQ","Preprint Servers","HCQ","TSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ","antiviral efficacy of CQ","safety of CQ","placebo efficacy differences","overall efficacy","efficacy assessment","age of patients","prevalence of adverse events","meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials","RCTs","risk of mild adverse events","common adverse events","well-controlled adverse events","pooled data","placebo arm","selected patients","adult patients","Clinical Trials Registries","randomized controlled trials","current antiviral dose regimens of CQ","Wanfang Data","risk ratio","Insufficient data","viral infection","meta-regression","Trial sequential analysis","treatment of viral diseases","significant heterogeneity","pooled prevalence","TSA","improvement of clinical symptoms","plasma viral load","odds ratio","nervous system","high heterogeneity","Treatment outcomes","Web of Science","CNKI","standard mean difference","Cochrane Central","EMBASE","CQVIP","Potential moderators of drug","PubMed","Preprint Servers","COVID","relative risks","derivative hydroxychloroquine","scramble","gastrointestinal systems","Conclusions","intervention","effects","sample size","random errors","Objective","drugs","Methods","study","Results","public attention","Background"],"language":"en"},

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p\u003C0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xiaowei; Yang, Juan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xiling; Zhou, Jiaxin; Chen, Zhiyuan; Li, Jing; Chen, Yinzi; Yan, Han; Zhang, Juanjuan; Zhang, Yongli; Wang, Yan; Qiu, Qi; Gong, Hui; Wei, Xianglin; Wang, Lili; Sun, Kaiyuan; Wu, Peng; Ajelli, Marco; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Viboud, Cecile; Yu, Hongjie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["China","Northeast","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["fatality risk of COVID","discharged cases","detected cases","critical patients","mortality risk factors","case fatality risk","hospitalized patients","Older age","mainland China","median age","estimates of CFR","age group","estimated CFR","severe acute respiratory syndrome","laboratory","Hubei","Middle East respiratory syndrome","ongoing epidemic","individual information","outbreak response","individual records","global epidemic threat","outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","H1N1 influenza pandemic","West","clinical category","vs","substantial health burden","severity assessment","years","developed economic regions","available official sources","Northeast","deceased","males","deaths","survival analyses","study","objectives","Conclusions","Results","methods"],"language":"en"},

It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR from the Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity and Childcare Hospital from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were enrolled. The epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from medical records. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to elucidate risk factors for patients with recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results 1087 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Of these, 20 (1.8%) died and 1067 (98.2%) were discharged from the hospital. Among the discharged cases, there were 81 (7.6%) patients found to develop a repeat positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA result. Older age was obviously associated with death. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to onset of complete RNA negative was 33.0 days (range, 6.0-82.0 days; IQR, 20.0-41.0 days), while that from illness onset to recurrence was 50.0 days (range, 21.0-95.0 days; IQR, 36.5-59.5 days). Multivariate regression analysis identified recurrence of positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA was associated with elevated IL-6 levels (P=0.004, OR=3.050; 95% CI, 1.432-6.499), increased lymphocyte count (P=0.038, OR=2.321; 95% CI, 1.048-5.138) and CT imaging features of lung consolidation (P=0.038, OR=1.641; 95% CI, 1.028-2.620) during hospitalization. Conclusion Elevated lymphocyte counts and IL-6 levels in blood, and consolidation features on CT imaging are useful risk factors for clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing recurrent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This is speculated to be caused by a balance in immune regulation when fighting virus toxicity. For patients with a high risk of recurrent positivity, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, J.; Xu, X.; Hu, J.; Chen, Q.; Xu, F.; Liang, H.; Liu, N.; Zhu, H.; Lan, J.; Zhou, L.; Xing, J.; Pu, N.; Cai, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27722c0a52e7cbe22703f976aa4a061d62bf4ac4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095018v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","consecutive patients","recurrent positivity of SARS","recurrent PCR positivity","recurrence of positive SARS-CoV","COVID","recurrent RT-PCR positivity","illness onset","high risk of recurrent positivity","repeat positive SARS-Cov","useful risk factors","onset of complete RNA negative","RNA result","consecutive negative RT-PCR results","consolidation features","levels","elevated IL","Childcare Hospital","hospital discharge","range","IQR","CT imaging features of lung consolidation","Conclusion Elevated lymphocyte","multivariable logistic regression methods","discharged cases","Multivariate regression analysis","retrospective cohort study","Background Coronavirus Disease","increased lymphocyte count","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity","prolonged observation","median duration","clinicians","laboratory","treatment","outcome data","blood","additional preventative measures","immune regulation","virus toxicity","future outbreaks","clinical course","balance","medical records","criteria","full-blown global pandemic","Older age","death","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 \u002B T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03B3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8\u002B T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jing; Li, Sumeng; Liu, Jia; Liang, Boyun; Wang, Xiaobei; Wang, Hua; Li, Wei; Tong, Qiaoxia; Yi, Jianhua; Zhao, Lei; Xiong, Lijuan; Guo, Chunxia; Tian, Jin; Luo, Jinzhuo; Yao, Jinghong; Pang, Ran; Shen, Hui; Peng, Cheng; Liu, Ting; Zhang, Qian; Wu, Jun; Xu, Ling; Lu, Sihong; Wang, Baoju; Weng, Zhihong; Han, Chunrong; Zhu, Huabing; Zhou, Ruxia; Zhou, Helong; Chen, Xiliu; Ye, Pian; Zhu, Bin; He, Shengsong; He, Yongwen; Jie, Shenghua; Wei, Ping; Zhang, Jianao; Lu, Yinping; Wang, Weixian; Zhang, Li; Li, Ling; Zhou, Fengqin; Wang, Jun; Dittmer, Ulf; Lu, Mengji; Hu, Yu; Yang, Dongliang; Zheng, Xin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7325363d061f0f4699e29bfa544438e14e7c207d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe cases","mild cases","confirmed COVID","early identification of severe COVID","counts of T cells","cytokine levels","disease severity","neutrophil counts","cytokines profiles of patients","cytokine profiles","T cell ratio","CD8","significant decreases","novel coronavirus disease","N8R","increases","dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets","proinflammatory cytokine storm","useful prognostic factor","powerful prognostic factor","IFN-\u03B3 levels","Peripheral blood samples","sustained decreases","flow cytometry","prognosis","later time points","degree of lymphopenia","specific immunoassays","correlation","Background","Method","analysis","Conclusion","Findings"],"language":"en"},

In Sao Paulo State, the first case of CoViD-19 was confirmed on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 was registered on 16 March, on 24 March the Sao Paulo State authorities implemented the isolation of persons in non-essential activities, which is programmed to end on June 1. The deterministic model used the data collected in Sao Paulo State to estimate the model parameters to describe the current epidemiological status in the State under isolation. We concluded that the proportion in isolation influenced the number of new cases in around 9 days ahead. We evaluate the suitability of lockdown in Sao Paulo State and concluded that this extreme measure should be efficient if lower transmission is occurring among isolated persons. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the release proportions of young and elder persons. We evaluated three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed 14 days between releases, and three strategies: the first release occurring on June 1, 15 and 23. We concluded that these three strategies are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of hospitalization due to severe CoViD-19 and deaths, due to presenting the effective reproduction number near one. However, if protection actions as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) could be massively disseminated in the population, we concluded there health care system may not collapse.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, H.

To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3\u00D710\u22124 substitutions/site/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C-\u003EU transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C-\u003EU and U-\u003EC substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C-\u003EU transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5\u2019U/A and 3\u2019U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U\u003E\u003EA\u003EG\u003E\u003EC) and low G\u002BC contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C-\u003EU hypermutation in their hosts. Importance The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simmonds, P.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa4b611459fea6a90924158afbf35ce258a5533a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.072330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","G C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["U transitions","U hypermutation","C substitutions","complete SARS-CoV","C contents","MERS-CoV","pandemic of SARS coronavirus","half of sequence changes","long term effects of prolonged C","non-pandemic human coronaviruses","emerged coronaviruses","different paradigm of virus sequence change","amino acid differences","Variants","flanking sequence contexts comparable","long term evolution","molecular epidemiology investigations","widespread occurrence of amino acid changes","motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins","base asymmetries","low G","nucleotide differences","fold base frequency","favoured mutational hotspots","Darwinian evolutionary frameworks","early evolutionary events","mid-range coronavirus substitution rate","reversion","directional asymmetry","emergence","adaptive value","dataset","HCoV-NL63","Repeated cycles of mutation","decreasing degree","process","profound implications","HKU1","OC43","host APOBEC","intensive analysis","worldwide spread","evidence","sequences","increasing divergence","site","year","Importance","hosts","Elevated ratios"],"language":"en"},

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection.

In most academic hospitals in the United States, inpatient rotations are designed to deliver optimal patient care by staggering rotations of attendings and house-staff, and much emphasis is placed on healthcare worker (HCW) burnout, yet during a pandemic preventing further infection is the single most important factor. Our purpose was to model various inpatient rotation schedules of physicians and nurses to determine patterns associated with optimal workforce preservation and lower nosocomial infections in settings in which personal protective equipment is imperfect or unavailable. Results: We employed Monte-Carlo simulations. Universal model parameters for COVID-19 included incubation period distribution and latent period distribution. Situation-dependent COVID-19 model parameters included pre-admission infection probability, team member infection probability, physician-to-patient, nurse-to-patient, patient-to-physician, patient-to-nurse, and HCW-to-HCW transmission probabilities, team member absence after symptom onset, daily SARS-CoV-2 exposure probability of team members (e.g. via exposure to other staff), length of admission after COVID-19 symptoms, and length of simulation time. Model parameters that varied by hospital setting and service type included average patient load per team, average patient hospitalization, and number of physicians and nurses on a team and on duty. The primary outcome measure was probability of team failure, defined as the likelihood that at some point there are insufficient attendings, house-staff or nurses to staff a fully functioning floor. In all our simulations, physician and nurse rotation lengths of 1-3 days led to higher team failure rates. Nursing shifts of 12 versus 8 hours and avoiding staggering of physician rotations decreased the chance of team failure. When the patient stay is short, the advantage of un-staggered rotations is consistent and universal. Conclusions: Simple changes in staff scheduling, such as longer nursing shifts, co-rotation of physicians and groups of nurses no more frequently than every 3 days results in improved workforce preservation. These workforce distancing changes are easy to implement.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kluger, D.

While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012\u002B/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy. Finally, I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bastolla, Ugo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60f9bdb06e4d0d721e3436eedbe6891594d2de46.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["John Hopkins University"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["apparent death rate","countries","extrapolated death rates","undetected cases","cumulative number","limit of infinite number of tests","country","intensity tests","ratio","Italy","epidemics","estimating","instantaneous apparent lethality rates","minimum number of parameters","extent of undetected infections","regularized regression","infinite time","cumulative data","rescaled ridge regression","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 outbreak","John Hopkins University database","worldwide reference","deceased persons","inverse relationship","indicator","orthogonal approach","beginning","pandemics","halting","big concern","days","variation","epidemiological models","agreement","estimates","Germany"],"language":"en"},

Various anticoagulation regimens are now being considered for these patients. Anticoagulation is known to increase the risk for adverse bleeding events, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most feared. We present a retrospective study of 33 patients positive for COVID-19 with neuroimaging-documented ICH and examine anticoagulation use in this population. Methods : Patients over the age of 18 with confirmed COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of ICH were included in this study. Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist. Electronic health records were analyzed for patient information including demographic data, medical history, hospital course, laboratory values, and medications. Results : We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37 to 83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small- moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery.

Objective: To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with Covid-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously linked to stroke. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: Two academic hospitals in New York City. Participants: We included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 from March 4, 2020 through May 2, 2020. Our comparison cohort included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A or B from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018 (calendar years spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). Exposures: Covid-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction, and laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B. Main Outcomes and Measures: A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, etiological mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of Covid-19 patients with ischemic stroke versus the proportion among patients with influenza. Results: Among 2,132 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19, 31 patients (1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0%-2.1%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78) and 58% were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 (26%) cases. For our comparison cohort, we identified 1,516 patients with influenza, of whom 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was significantly higher with Covid-19 than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.3-24.9). Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. Future studies should investigate the thrombotic mechanisms in Covid-19 in order to determine optimal strategies to prevent disabling complications like ischemic stroke.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merkler, A.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n=16) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n=6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was \u226596% for all assays and the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kasteren, Puck B.; van der Veer, Bas; van den Brink, Sharon; Wijsman, Lisa; de Jonge, J\u00F8rgen; van den Brandt, Annemarie; Molenkamp, Richard; Reusken, Chantal B.E.M.; Meijer, Adam","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec17e5f3c5a412d7716b0ae356de61e4bafb0cf9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Altona Diagnostics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR efficiency","clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits","positive clinical samples","clinical samples positive","SARS-CoV","commercial kits","panel of SARS","real-time reverse transcriptase PCR","non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections","novel coronavirus","panel of RNA","preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity","study","assays","spread","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Altona Diagnostics","serial dilutions of viral RNA","human population","detection rate","limit of detection","estimated LOD95","specific method available","related human coronaviruses","routine diagnostics of COVID","BGI","PrimerDesign","CerTest Biotec","KH Medical","different manufacturers","patients","infected individuals","accurate identification of virus","R-Biopharm AG","variations","experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories","assay specificity","emergence","cross-reactivity","major burden","Seegene","E-gene","globe","society","final months","fold range","Measures","aim"],"language":"en"},

In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (\u0022swab-to-RT-LAMP\u0022). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel. We propose decentralised COVID-19 testing as a routine to allow facilities and institutions to return to near-to-full functionality.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dao Thi, V.

Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries. Design: A cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified. Participants: In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week. Results: Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time. Conclusions: In European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels. In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meier, Karien; Glatz, Toivo; Guijt, Mathijs C; Piccininni, Marco; van der Meulen, Merel; Atmar, Khaled; Jolink, Anne-Tess C; Kurth, Tobias; Rohmann, Jessica L; Zamanipoor Najafabadi, Amir H","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20049676","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Germany","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["range","governmental measures","respiratory measures","effectiveness of protective measures","enforced social distancing measures","elaborate measures of social lockdown","self-initiated measures","social media","social gatherings","Italian respondents","categorized community containment measures","social distancing behaviors","European countries","Italian residents","reported implementation","Dutch residents","stage IV","complete social lockdown effective","greatest COVID","Information channels","degree of public belief","Participants","various communication channels","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","selective closure of public places","relevant information","containment strategies","following week","coronavirus disease","coronavirus SARS-CoV","cross-sectional online survey available","multiple languages","hand hygiene","people","country","daily life","Design","possible dynamics","burden","support","included television","stringency","infection","major changes","answers","time","extent","Results","descriptive statistics","official health websites","outbreak","days","Objectives","total","adults","Response collection","study","Conclusions","newspapers"],"language":"en"},

Preferably, the performance of serological tests for a novel virus should be determined with clinical specimens against a gold standard, i.e. virus neutralisation. We evaluated specificity and sensitivity of six commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, including four automated assays [Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG (CE marked), Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (research use only), and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (CE marked)], and two rapid lateral flow (immunocromatographic) tests [Acro Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM (CE marked) and Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (CE marked)] in comparison with a microneutralisation test (MNT). Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies with median of 11 days (range 3-51) after onset of symptoms. The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1%/80.5% (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9%/43.8% (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 68.3%/87.8% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6%/70.7% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4%/56.1% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5%/46.3% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5%/71.9% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8%/81.3% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgM).

The pandemic has also increased the use of hypo-fractionated treatment schedules where MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation. This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, thus requiring novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care. Materials and Methods A remote physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products. Our remote physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour, and review images and plans. The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote physician ART coverage. Visual quality was calculated using cross correlation between the treatment delivery computer screen and the remote physician screen. Results For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24.9\u00B16.1min. In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29.2\u00B19.8min. The correlation between the console screen and the remote physician screen was R = 0.95. Conclusion Our novel remote physician ART coverage practice is secure, interactive, timely, and of high visual quality. When utilizing remote physicians for ART, our department was able to increase physical distancing to lower the risk of virus transmission while providing specialty care to our patients in need.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Price, Alex; Kim, Hyun; Henke, Lauren E.; Knutson, Nels C.; Spraker, Matthew B.; Michalski, Jeff; Hugo, Geoffrey D.; Robinson, Clifford G.; Green, Olga","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2af1e28ac77f587aeae0b8ef6ce330d4af6c1666.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S245210942030138X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245210942030138X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["remote coverage","remote physician screen","remote physician coverage practice","implementation of remote physician ART coverage","novel remote physician ART coverage practice","remote physicians","fractions","novel coverage practices","physical distancing","beginning of treatment","treatment delivery computer screen","console screen","average time","risk of transmission","fractionated treatment schedules","specialty care","increased staffing","increased importance","pandemic","risk of virus transmission","completion of image registration","high visual quality","cross correlation","close proximity","MR","Methods","use of hypo","Conclusion","control","specialized technique","Purposes","COVID","radiation oncology departments","Materials","adaptive radiotherapy","Abstract Background","patients","need","review images","available software products","plans","dose escalation","Results","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Transmission rates can be explained by seasonal weather conditions, but this does not account for observed variations in fatality rates. Many factors point to Vitamin D as a candidate explanation but historical controversy surrounding Vitamin D studies and the lack of a coherent framework for causal inference has hampered acceptance of this explanation despite a wealth of evidence in its favour. We analyse global COVID-19 data using Causal Inference, constructing two contrasting directed acyclic graph (DAG) models, one causal and one acausal, and set out clearly multiple predictions made by each model. We show that observed data strongly match predictions made by the causal model but largely contradict those of the acausal model. We explore historic evidence further supporting the causal model. We review biochemical mechanisms that may explain the various ways in which vitamin D acts. We detail the mechanisms by which the SARS-Cov-2 virus causes the disease and known pathways that involve Vitamin D and show how these both protect against viral infection, as well as ameliorating disease symptoms in COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We examine the factors that govern confidence in causal inference models and conclude that a high level of confidence in a causal beneficial role for Vitamin D is justified.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, G.; Garami, A.

Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients have varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with 3-4% mortality rate. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome can be caused by tissue damage mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of such responses remain elusive, with an incomplete understanding of how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Here, we use a dynamical systems approach to dissect the emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics among virally infected cells, the immune response to it and the consequent immunopathology. By mechanistic analysis of cell-cell interactions, we have identified key parameters affecting the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19. This minimalistic yet rigorous model can explain the various phenotypes observed across the clinical spectrum of COVID-19, various co-morbidity risk factors such as age and obesity, and the effect of antiviral drugs on different phenotypes. It also reveals how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results will help further the case of rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage simultaneously. Significance Statement The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected millions of people, and thousands of lives have been lost to it. The pandemic has already tested the limits of our public healthcare systems with a wide spectrum of clinicopathological symptoms and outcomes. The mechanistic underpinnings of the resultant immunopathology caused by the viral infection still remains to be elucidated. Here we propose a minimalistic but rigorous description of the interactions of the virus infected cells and the core components of the immune system that can potentially explain such diversity in the observed clinical outcomes. Our proposed framework could enable a platform to determine the efficacy of various treatment combinations and can contributes a conceptual understanding of dynamics of disease pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahoo, Sarthak; Hari, Kishore; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Jolly, Mohit Kumar","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c5c0ce8b46059f118268408d45b701655f7381d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.097238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Distress"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected patients","virus infected cells","various phenotypes","cells of innate","fine-tuned balance of infected cell","diverse clinical phenotypes","different phenotypes","SARS-CoV","Severe symptoms","infected millions of people","adaptive immune system","adaptive immune response","different severe phenotypes","observed clinical outcomes","cell interactions","mild symptoms","mechanistic underpinnings","clinical spectrum of COVID","mechanistic analysis of cell","diverse clinicopathological outcomes","wide spectrum of clinicopathological symptoms","viral clearance","viral infection","infection clearance","global pandemic","tissue damage","efficacy of various treatment combinations","conceptual understanding of dynamics","incomplete understanding","disease pathogenesis","resultant immunopathology","rigorous description","rigorous model","consequent immunopathology","various co-morbidity risk factors","public healthcare systems","dynamical systems approach","emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics","case of rational selection of drug combinations","pneumonia","intricate interplay","core components","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","key parameters","obesity","rest","cough","effect of antiviral drugs","disruptions","resolution of inflammation","varying degrees of severity","platform","fever","responses","limits","diversity","thousands of lives","Significance Statement","long-term changes","proposed framework","infections","cytokine storm","mortality rate","results"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM \u0026 IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Wei Yee; Lim, Siew Hoon; Seng, Eng Hong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc4410fe641e692dddea2a54aa2732c3032bdae2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20034454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IgM \u0026 IgG","IIFA","IIFA IgM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","SARS-CoV test assays","presence of antibodies","total antibodies","detectable antibodies","COVID","IIFA IgM test","serial sera","Existing diagnostic assays","illness","IIFA method","Methods","ELISA assay","availability of specific serology tests","contact tracing","new emerging virus","indirect immunofluorescence","epidemiological investigations","interim measure","early phase","IgG","shares","genome identity","extent of community","Conclusions","poor sensitivity","days","week","evidence of seroconversion","Cross-reactivity","onset of symptoms","timing of appearance","Results","conserved structure","Background","infection"],"language":"en"},

However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. Methods Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18\u201325, 2020 with 1,630 Chinese participants (aged 18\u201368 years). Results Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. Conclusions These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaolin; Lan, Mengxue; Li, Huixiang; Yang, Juan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9d55e2c48c4c8d21abd3ac16cadb3be8adf97b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1389945720302240; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945720302240?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["perceived stress levels","decreased sleep quality","better sleep quality","lower sleep quality","higher perceived stress","influence of perceived stress","indirect effect of perceived stress","COVID","low levels of self-esteem","higher anxiety levels","high levels of self-esteem","pandemic","mediation effect of anxiety","non-diseased general public required attention","important role of self-esteem","front-line workers","findings","associated stressors","moderated mediation model","Chinese participants","moderation","psychological problems","personality characteristics","coronavirus disease","environmental adaptation","turn","Abstract Background","poor sleepers","Methods Questionnaire-based surveys","relationship","China","years","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (~19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ~2kb long) gene.

NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states. We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs. Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus. We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khailaie, Sahamoddin; Mitra, Tanmay; Bandyopadhyay, Arnab; Schips, Marta; Mascheroni, Pietro; Vanella, Patrizio; Lange, Berit; Binder, Sebastian; Meyer-Hermann, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c3c810250221b9947a2848a87a2b9126c545939.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053637","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Robert"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["latest reproduction number","number of patients","necessity of NPIs","peak number of infected individuals","viral spreading","place","Germany","federal states","control","initial phase of CoV","novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV","simulation of epidemic progression","health care system","intensive care units","data-driven estimation","extended infection-epidemic model","subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions","starting point","world-wide pandemic","evolution","scenarios of major immunisation","risk","population","hospitals","economic recession","diseases","fit","different regions of Italy","eradication","unforeseeable implications","collateral damage","Robert Koch-Institute","frequency of suicide","ICUs","time","mortality","range","border line","release","progress of containment","parameters","concern","measures"],"language":"en"},

This differs from the case-fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy-makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19. Methods: Pubmed and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25/04/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports. Results: After exclusions, there were 13 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and April 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point-estimate of IFR of 0.75% (0.49-1.01%) with significant heterogeneity (p\u003C0.001). Conclusion: Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until the end of April, 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.75% (0.49-1.01%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents the \u0022true\u0022 point estimate. It is likely that different places will experience different IFRs. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policy-making on this front.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyerowitz-Katz, G.; Merone, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa17548def132bf7ee6344c4439544905febcdc6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.20089854v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR","IFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["estimates of IFR","final meta-analysis","meta-analysis of published evidence","COVID","age-stratified IFR","point estimate","CFR","infection-fatality rate","case-fatality rate","different places","different IFRs","number of deaths","high heterogeneity","policy-makers","Google Scholar","significant heterogeneity","total number of cases","systematic review","proportion","lay public","pandemic","Stata","wide range of countries","set of terms","grey literature","important unknown","confidence intervals","metan command","overall mortality","Medrxiv","Boolean operators","government reports","research","experts","inclusion","exclusions","Methods","Pubmed","Introduction","study","Conclusion","disease","populations","Articles","authors","Results","end"],"language":"en"},

Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in congregate shelters is high, but shelter characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission are currently unknown. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study across five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. We tested people 18 years of age and older staying in Rhode Island congregate shelters in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey instrument was designed and implemented based on an a priori sample size. All consented participants reported basic demographics, recent travel, duration of time at the shelter, any symptomatology, and had their temperature and pulse oximetry measured. Each participant was tested for COVID-19 using nasopharyngeal swabbing. Shelter characteristics about location, occupancy, resident length of stay, and COVID-19 mitigation strategies were collected through structured phone questionnaire with shelter staff. Results: A total of 302 individuals were screened and 299 participated across five homeless shelters. The median age was 47.9 (range 18-85) and 20% were female. Of the 299 participants, 35 (11.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2; rates varied among shelters, ranging from 0% to 35%. Among the participants in the study, 5% had a new cough, 4% shortness of breath, and 3% reported loss of taste or smell. Symptom prevalence did not vary significantly between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 groups. Regular symptom screening was not associated with lower infection rates. Shelters with higher rates of positivity were in more densely populated areas, cared for a more transient populations, and instituted fewer social distancing practices for sleeping arrangements or mealtimes. Conclusions and Relevance: Residents of congregate shelters are at increased risk for asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To reduce transmission and enable continuation of low-threshold shelter services, there is a need for universal testing, implementation of infection control and physical distancing measures within congregate shelters, and expansion of non-congregate supportive housing.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samuels, E.

Tetherin is an important restriction factor which inhibits the release of a diverse range of viruses from host cells, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, some of which are deadly to humans and transmitted by bats. Here we characterise the tetherin genes from 27 species of bats, revealing that they are under strong selective pressure, and that fruit bats and vesper bats express unique structural variants of the tetherin protein. The expression of two computationally predicted splice isoforms of fruit bat tetherin is verified here, and we identify an additional third unique splice isoform which includes a C-terminal region that is not homologous to known mammalian tetherin variants. We also report that vesper bats possess and express at least five tetherin genes, including structural variants, a greater number than any other mammal reported to date. These findings support the hypothesis of differential antiviral gene evolution in bats relative to other mammals.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayward, Joshua A.; Tachedjian, Mary; Johnson, Adam; Gordon, Tamsin B.; Cui, Jie; Marsh, Glenn A.; Baker, Michelle L.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Tachedjian, Gilda","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8cd670416c9e0e4d52ceb23916979a4736f91d3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fruit bats","vesper bats","bats relative","species of bats","tetherin genes","tetherin protein","mammalian tetherin variants","mammals","unique structural variants","predicted splice isoforms of fruit bat tetherin","humans","important reservoirs of viruses deadly","unique splice isoform","diverse range of viruses","important restriction factor","hypothesis of differential antiviral gene evolution","host cells","release","coronaviruses","retroviruses","C-terminal region","questions","greater number","immune differences","strong selective pressure","filoviruses","findings","paramyxoviruses","expression","infections","date"],"language":"en"},

Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k, and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods.

The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3-11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher\u0027s exact tests, and t-tests. Results 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about coronavirus infection (p\u003C0.0001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p=0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p=0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. Conclusions Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of the coronavirus.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lou, E.; Teoh, D.; Brown, K.; Blaes, A.; Holtan, S.

The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein.

Here, we pseudotyped the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SPG) on a retroviral (MMLV) as well as a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the transduction efficiency in several mammalian cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2. While MMLV pseudotyped the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) efficiently, it could not pseudotype SPG. In contrast, pLV pseudotyped both glycoproteins efficiently; however, much higher titers of pLV-G particles were produced. Among all the tested mammalian cells, 293Ts expressing hACE2 were most efficiently transduced using the pLV-S system. The pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by diluted serum (\u003E:640) from a recently recovered COVID-19 patient who showed high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG levels.

Our findings show that a early lockdowns barely shift the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics developed independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity accounts for the observed delays across different regions. Analogous arguments would apply to the international borders. We also show how disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based mechanisms can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies.

Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto \u201Cthrow away the physics, keep the organisation\u201D. Rosen\u0027s strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen\u0027s presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen\u0027s work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen\u0027s relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen\u0027s definition of life, \u201Corganisms are closed to efficient causation\u201D, should be considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be implemented in mathematical models are presented.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siekmann, Ivo","journal":"Ecological Complexity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4819906599388bff52fea2b4c05f3414a1656242.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476945X17300624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X17300624","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Robert Rosen","Rosen"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rosen\u0027s relational models","mathematical models","weaknesses of relational models","Rosen\u0027s strong rejection of mechanistic models","hand Rosen\u0027s presentation","Rosen\u0027s definition of life","aspects of Rosen\u0027s work","philosophical ideas","original approach","different approach","mathematical modellers","particular type of mechanistic model","theoretical biologist Robert Rosen","biological system","specific underlying assumptions","underlying structural details","extensive use of mathematics","strong form of reductionism","concrete biological problems","fundamental problem of biology","current network biology literature","comparison","organisms","modelling framework","components","motto","elements","relationships","question","strengths","postulate","physics","efficient causation","systems","organisation","article","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Background and objectives Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population. The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases.

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults (OR/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, X.; Lv, M.; Wang, X.; Long, X.; Ren, M.; Zhang, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, W.; Zhou, Q.; Ma, Y.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline. We suggest that awareness of the severity of the short- and long-term epidemic is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weitz, J.

Design: Observational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Exposure: A data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS). Results: Hourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%.

We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship\u0027s 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Methods To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry. Results Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy. Conclusions A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

Design: Community survey Setting: The COVID Symptom Tracker mobile application co-developed by physicians and scientists at Kings College London, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK and US on 24th and 29th March 2020 respectively. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms and testing. Participants: 2,618,948 users of the COVID Symptom Tracker App. UK (95.7%) and US (4.3%) population. Data cut-off for this analysis was 21st April 2020. Main outcome measures: Visit to hospital and for those who attended hospital, the need for respiratory support in three subgroups (i) self-reported COVID-19 infection with classical symptoms (SR-COVID-19), (ii) self-reported positive COVID-19 test results (T-COVID-19), and (iii) imputed/predicted COVID-19 infection based on symptomatology (I-COVID-19). Multivariate logistic regressions for each outcome and each subgroup were adjusted for age and gender, with sensitivity analyses adjusted for comorbidities. Classical symptoms were defined as high fever and persistent cough for several days. Results: Older age and all comorbidities tested were found to be associated with increased odds of requiring hospital care for COVID-19. Obesity (BMI \u003E30) predicted hospital care in all models, with odds ratios (OR) varying from 1.20 [1.11; 1.31] to 1.40 [1.23; 1.60] across population groups. Pre-existing lung disease and diabetes were consistently found to be associated with hospital visit with a maximum OR of 1.79 [1.64,1.95] and 1.72 [1.27; 2.31]) respectively. Findings were similar when assessing the need for respiratory support, for which age and male gender played an additional role. Conclusions: Being older, obese, diabetic or suffering from pre-existing lung, heart or renal disease placed participants at increased risk of visiting hospital with COVID-19. It is of utmost importance for governments and the scientific and medical communities to work together to find evidence-based means of protecting those deemed most vulnerable from COVID-19.

The definition of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames is a key step in delineating targets for vaccination and treatment for COVID-19. Here, we report an integrative analysis of three independent direct RNA sequencing datasets of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We find strong evidence for variant open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A variant transcript for the matrix protein (M) lacking its N-terminal transmembrane domain, initiated by a TTG start codon, is produced by a strong transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS)-mediated junction within the M ORF and represents up to 19% of all M ORFs. Sporadic non-canonical junctions in the spike (S) ORF lead to N-terminal truncations that remove the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains from up to 25% of S ORFs. Surprisingly, nearly all ORFs from ORF1a identified in these transcriptome sequences were variant. These ORFs contain the first 200-800 amino acids of ORF1a and may represent a mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of ORF1a nonstructural proteins. We show there is strong transcriptome and junctional support for variant ORF1a ORFs in independent direct RNA sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing datasets, and further show that up to 1/3 of these ORFs are expected to have C-terminal fusions with downstream genes. Finally, we show that currently unannotated ORFs are abundant in the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. Together, these analyses help to elucidate the diverse coding potential of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nomburg, Jason; Meyerson, Matthew; DeCaprio, James A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2a6c85690afeefa120bf5c74da1f2e442b3ba8f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.066951","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TTG","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","variant ORF1a ORFs","S ORFs","unannotated ORFs","strong transcriptome","definition of SARS","independent direct RNA sequencing datasets","N-terminal truncations","variant open reading frames","variant transcript","transcriptome sequences","N-terminal transmembrane domain","diverse coding potential of SARS","positive-sense RNA virus","strong evidence","C-terminal fusions","amino acids of ORF1a","COVID","relative abundance of ORF1a nonstructural proteins","strong transcriptional regulatory sequence","ORF lead","spike","key step","junctional support","vaccination","delineating targets","TRS","family Coronaviridae","current worldwide pandemic","Sporadic non-canonical junctions","coronavirus disease","mediated junction","integrative analysis","treatment","downstream genes","receptor-binding domains","matrix protein","TTG","mechanism","analyses","codon"],"language":"en"},

Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions.

As of now no valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing lockdowns. Aim of this Study: This study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease. Material \u0026 Methods Data relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones. Results: COVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25 patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and number of treating physicians/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome. However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12] , new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing, suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of testing.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"GHOSAL, SAMIT; Sinha, Binayak; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","Material \u0026 Methods Data","World Bank"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","rates of infection","infection rates","number of cases","total deaths","rates of testing","related deaths","new deaths","number of beds available","lesser number of beds","number of tests","patients","Study","hospital beds","new cases","rates of active infections","GDP share","physicians","GDP growth","patient population","related outcome","Methods Data","inverse correlation","negative correlation","Additional data","novel coronavirus epidemic","available bed numbers","predicted death rate","World Bank database","respective countries","preventative strategy","analytical strategy","date of analysis","XL-Stat statistical software","comparison","increased risk of worsening outcomes","communities","illness","strength of association","draconian step of social isolation","primary output variable","sex","robust dataset","Python","havoc","millions","Jupyter notebook","hour","country","severity","inferential overtones","socioeconomic recession","China","lockdowns","valid treatment","file","parameters","age","Introduction","governments","Material","model","impact","tools","CSV format","need","situation report","Results","daily basis","bid","disease","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

As of this writing, hydroxychloroquine is a leading candidate in the treatment of COVID-19. By combining AI with human analysis, our RMA identified 11 studies looking at ocular toxicity as a side effect and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI: 1.11-9.96%). The heterogeneity across the individual study findings was high, and interpretation of the result should take this into account.

Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results.

With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age.

We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France). Methods: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Results: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (\u003E70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death. Conclusions: This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in breast cancer patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vuagnat, P.; Frelaut, M.; Ramtohul, T.; Basse, C.; Diakite, S.; Noret, A.; Bellesoeur, A.; Servois, V.; Hequet, D.; Laas, E.; Kirova, Y.; Cabel, L.; Pierga, J.-Y.; Institut Curie Breast Cancer and COVID Group,; Bozec, L.; Paoletti, X.; Cottu, P.; Bidard, F.-C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b1669e1e7d1e9da88ea31356fd73817b1b6e93e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20085928v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["breast cancer patients","outcome of patients","breast cancer treatment","metastatic breast cancer","extent of COVID","suspected COVID","higher risk of COVID","significant non-cancer comorbidities","current anti-cancer treatment","ICH","prospective registry analysis","extent of radiation therapy sequelae","prior radiation therapy fields","infection","typical radiologic signs","common radiologic sign","higher risk of intensive care unit admission","univariate analysis","time of analysis","risk of severe SARS-CoV","Common clinical features","Institut Curie hospitals","viral RNA testing","Paris area","ground-glass opacities","mortality rate","symptoms","cough","fever","association","complications","months","hypertension","age","France","IRB","diagnosis","lung lesions","Conclusions","Methods","Special attention","factors","deaths","characteristics","Background","Results","corticosteroids"],"language":"en"},

It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before. Comments and conclusions: This model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"MONLEON-GETINO, TONI; Canela-Soler, Jaume","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46e37af1e1b4812cf748198b969b105ae93ee50e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059881","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["Spain","maximum number of cases","evolution of accumulated cases","different scenarios of accumulated cases","SARS-CoV","new model of SARS","evolution of SARS","parametric model Weibull","asymptote","progress","end","worst case","respiratory disease","vertical lines","new type of coronavirus","people","order","work","spread","library BDSbiost3","short report","analyses","future outbreaks of diseases","methods","predictive models","COVID","time scale","brake","Background","objectives","projective curves","general goal","Material","actions","policies","recent weeks","Comments","conclusions","entire planet","summer","days","worst-case scenario","resources","Results","year","value"],"language":"en"},

Genomic studies are in process to identify differences in host susceptibility to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Open source research publications are accessible to pre-genotyped individuals. Males are more at risk from severe COVID-19. METHODS: To facilitate development of Clinical Genetics support to the public and healthcare professionals, genomic structure and variants in 213,158 exomes/genomes were integrated for ACE2 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACMG/AMP-based pathogenicity criteria were applied. RESULTS: Across the 19 ACE2 exons on the X chromosome, 9 of 3596 (0.25%) nucleotides were homozygous variant in females compared to 262/3596 (7.3%) hemizygous variant in males (p\u003C 0.0001). 90% of variants were very rare, although K26R affecting a SARS-CoV-2-interacting amino acid is present in ~1/239 people. Modelling the \u0027\u0027COVID-resistant \u0027\u0027 state where pathogenic alleles would be beneficial, nine null alleles met PVS1. Thirty-seven variants met PM1 based on critical location \u002B/-PP3 based on computational modelling. Modelling a \u0027\u0027COVID-susceptible \u0027\u0027 state, 31 variants in four upstream open reading frames and 5\u0027 untranslated regions could meet PM1, and may have differential effects if aminoglycoside antibiotics were prescribed for pneumonia and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Males are more likely to exhibit consequences from a single variant ACE2 allele. Differential allele frequencies in COVID-19 susceptible and resistant individuals are likely to emerge before variants meet ACMG/AMP criteria for actionable results in patients. Prioritising genomic regions for functional study and ACMG/AMP-structured approaches to research-based presentation of COVID-19 susceptibility variant results are encouraged.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shovlin, C.

Design Retrospective case series. Setting Spain, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Norway. Participants All laboratory-confirmed infection cases (n=168,089) collected from February 21st to April 14th 2020. Main outcome measures Infection spreading velocity according to viral mutation load and to climate region. Results The mean doubling time of COVID-19 was 6.63 days in northern Italy, 5.87 days in central areas, and 5.38 days in southern Italy, with shorter COVID-19 doubling time in warmer regions. Spain extended this trend, with a mean COVID-19 doubling time of 4.2 days. At the other end of the spectrum, slower diffusion across progressively colder regions was observed in Scandinavia, with 9.4 days COVID-19 doubling time in Sweden, 10.8 days in Finland and 12.95 days in Norway. Mutations and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 versus COVID-19 spreading were analyzed worldwide. Models of increased aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 upon progressive acquisition of genetic changes were not supported by regional mutation data. Conclusion Current propagation models suggest dependence of COVID-19 pandemic spreading on wintertime conditions, with expected waning over the summer. Our findings indicate association of COVID-19 to a sharp North/South climate gradient, with faster spreading in southern regions. Thus, warmer climate conditions may not limit SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Very cold regions may be better spared by recurrent courses of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alberti, S.; Di Pietro, R.; Basile, M.; Antolini, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca3d714ebbfdd91582924470e78a50ac10fbeed3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095448v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden","Norway","Finland"],"keyphrases":["days COVID","mean COVID","dependence of COVID","shorter COVID","association of COVID","mean doubling time of COVID","environmental determinants of COVID","SARS-CoV","southern regions","warmer regions","faster spreading","southern Italy","colder regions","cold regions","mutation rates of SARS","warmer climate conditions","Sweden","climate region","northern Italy","infection cases","Finland","Norway","Spain","Models of increased aggressiveness of SARS","South climate gradient","viral mutation load","regional mutation data","recurrent courses of infection","wintertime conditions","Main outcome measures Infection","slower diffusion","progressive acquisition of genetic changes","Conclusion Current propagation models","velocity","sharp North","central areas","expected waning","spectrum","laboratory","pandemic","Scandinavia","Design Retrospective case series","Participants","Mutations","trend","summer","Objective","findings"],"language":"en"},

The infection shows the primary symptoms of pneumonia and has an incubation period, with the majority of people showing symptoms within 14 days. Online Social Networks are the closest simulations of real-world networks and have similar topology characteristics. This article simulates the spread and control of the nCoV-19 using the SIQR-t model to highlight the importance of self-quarantine and exercise of proper health care as a method to prevent the spread of the virus. Method The article uses the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered model with modification, introducing 14 different Infected states depending on the number of days the host has been carrying the infection. We simulate the spread of 2019-nCoV on human interaction similar graph taken from Online Social Network Epinions, of about 75000 nodes, similar to a small town or settlement. The infection rates depend on the sanitation and cleanliness these people exercise. Results When people practice self-quarantine and hygiene, aided by the governmental efforts of testing and quarantine, the cumulative number of affected people fall drastically. The decrease is apparent in time-based simulations of the spread received from the study. Conclusion The 2019-nCoV is a highly infectious zoonotic virus. It has spread like a pandemic, and governments across the world have launched quarantines. The results of the SIQR-t model indicate that hygiene and social-distancing can reduce its impact and sharply decrease the infection scale.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution March 1-April 19 2020 for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance (N = 13,934). Results: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p \u003C.001).

This study explored the characteristics and identified that China\u0027s control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of COVID-19. This study also seeks to expand the experiences and lessons from this outbreak. Methods: We collected public health interventions measures from Jan 20, 2020, to 5 March 2020, and data from COVID-19 daily newly confirmed cases and daily cumulates cases to compare the control effects and changing trends. We performed a retrospective description of these intervention strategies from three stages. Besides, from the perspective of public health, the experiences and lessons exposed by this outbreak were roughly summarized. Results: These non-pharmacology interventions measures adopted by the Chinese government by the instruction and spirit of President Xi Jinping were timely and efficient. Conclusions: The present study was conducted to comprehensively analyze from a social epidemiology context. The results confirmed that these radical interventions taken by the Chinese government were effective, ambitious, and agile. However, we must be aware that the epidemic situation in Wuhan is still challenging.

A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing understanding of the benefit-risk balance for remdesivir in COVID-19 treatment by using a structured method which uses all available data. Methods: The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework was used to assess the overall benefit-risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. We searched PubMed,Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. Results: Several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in COVID-19 compared to placebo have been identified. In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.75), although the study was underpowered. In another trial, a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed (11 vs 15 days), with non-significant reduced mortality risk (8% vs 12%). Risk data were only available from one trial. This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) comparted to the placebo group (26%), however more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared to those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%). Conclusions: Preliminary clinical trial results suggest a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared to placebo, however there is limited safety data available at the current time. The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed. Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, M.; Osborne, V.; Lane, S.; Roy, D.; Dhanda, S.; Evans, A.; Shakir, S.

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. In order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2\u2019 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bestle, Dorothea; Heindl, Miriam Ruth; Limburg, Hannah; van, Thuy Van Lam; Pilgram, Oliver; Moulton, Hong; Stein, David A.; Hardes, Kornelia; Eickmann, Markus; Dolnik, Olga; Rohde, Cornelius; Becker, Stephan; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang; Steinmetzer, Torsten; B\u00F6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00E4user, Eva","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a3ade5d2994efd9b2b29e94e874b822d560144.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.042085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","activation of SARS","synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2","various TMPRSS2 inhibitors","treatment of COVID","synthetic furin inhibitor MI","human airway cells","single serine protease inhibitor","combination of furin","S protein","transmembrane serine protease","host cell proteases","potential drug targets","approved antiviral drug","human airway epithelial cells","antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression","Calu","broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin","promising drug targets","S2 site","proprotein convertase furin","virus replication","specific antiviral therapies","potent antiviral activity","high therapeutic potential","S1","urgent need","E64d","acute infection","inhibition of endosomal cathepsins","vaccines","respiratory tract","patients","different sites","surface glycoprotein spike","present study","countries","contrast","approach","novel coronavirus","severe disease","lethality","current pandemic","Wuhan","data","order","China"],"language":"en"},

(1,2) Although testing was initially focused on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, this effort has now expanded to include surveillance of asymptomatic patients in order to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial infections. There is an urgent need to understand best practices for the delivery of routine medical care during an ongoing outbreak. (3) Here we report the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients screened prior to admission or a surgical or aerosolizing procedure. Methods Beginning March 30, 2020, our hospital began screening all asymptomatic patients prior to needed surgeries and aerosolizing procedures (n=350). On April 13, 2020, we expanded this practice to universal surveillance screening of all patients prior to admission (n=349). Testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the Washington state emergency use authorized University of Washington CDC-based laboratory-developed test or FDA authorized DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2, Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, or Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Washington Medical Center (STUDY00009734). Informed consent was not required. Results For patients undergoing surgical or aerosolizing procedures, 3 of 350 patients (0.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. For patients who were asymptomatic and tested at the time of admission, 3 of 349 patients (0.9%) were positive and 2 of 349 (0.6%) were inconclusive; inconclusive results were treated as low-level positives. For asymptomatic patients tested for any other reason (e.g. exposure risk), 12 of 157 patients (7.6%) were positive and 1 of 157 (0.6%) were inconclusive. Meanwhile, of the 473 inpatients in this period who had any symptom concerning for COVID-19, 68 of 473 patients (14.3%) were positive. There was a variety of ordering services and locations in all indication categories, with no particular predominating medical service or location. During this time period the outpatient prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 active infection in our region was 3-5% (manuscript in review). Discussion The application of universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to surgery or aerosolizing procedure shows that the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 is low (\u003C1%) in asymptomatic patients without known exposure risk factors. The positivity rate for asymptomatic patients on admission screen was similar; both measures were notably lower than recently reported measurements during an outbreak in New York City that found a positivity rate of 13.7% in asymptomatic pregnant women. (4) The rate of sub-clinical infection likely varies with the scale of the community outbreak. Even in the context of a community-wide outbreak, our data show a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the urgent pre-procedural setting. These data reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of individuals who use medical services and provide an assessment of exposure risk to other patients and healthcare workers around the time of admission. The Greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) also recently published results from the first 18 days of home-based testing and reported no positive tests in 1392 patients reporting no COVID-19-like illness. (5) Although other studies support a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, the data from this metropolitan outbreak do not support a similar pattern. Clinical providers, especially those involved in performing procedures that have a risk of aerosolization, are asking for methods to risk-assess patients prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure testing is one option to accomplish this goal. Importantly, in the midst of an outbreak, testing prior to procedures can decrease the use of PPE, identify appropriate precautions for patients, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mays, J.

However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community. Social distancing and vigilant epidemiological control are crucial to the containment of COVID-19 transmission","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Kenneth Siu-Sing; Ng, Timothy Ting-Leung; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Yau, Miranda Chong-Yee; Lao, Hiu-Yin; Choi, Ming-Pan; Tam, Kingsley King-Gee; Lee, Lam-Kwong; Wong, Barry Kin-Chung; Ho, Alex Yat-Man; Yip, Kam-Tong; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Liu, Raymond Wai-To; Tso, Eugene Yuk-Keung; Leung, Wai-Shing; Chan, Man-Chun; Ng, Yuk-Yung; Sin, Kit-Man; Fung, Kitty Sau-Chun; Chau, Sandy Ka-Yee; To, Wing-Kin; Que, Tak-Lun; Shum, David Ho-Keung; Yip, Shea Ping; Yam, Wing-Cheong; Siu, Gilman Kit Hang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f8fb557a6ac5b05a6dd3c0f8b7295a136d4e63a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20045740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina","ICU"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["local cases of COVID","reported cases","Hong Kong","imported cases","patients","containment of COVID","Initial cases of coronavirus disease","local community transmissions","epidemiological data","local infections","epidemiological investigation","transmission clusters","divergence time of transmission","territory-wide overview of COVID","vigilant epidemiological control","hospital admission","common signs","recent common ancestor","SARS-CoV","ICU admission","evolutionary rate","Global phylogeny of SARS","reproduction number value","Mainland China","ongoing outbreak","common mutation Orf3a G251V","estimated time","Phylogenetic analysis","Phylogenetic relatedness","recent travel records","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","family","unknown source","symptom onset","phylogenomic characteristics","WGS","hallmark","tMRCA","religious gatherings","average interval","closed settings","Social distancing","genome sequencing","cough","04x10","demographic","symptoms","Background","subclades","placement","Illumina platforms","substitutions","site","days","end","year","Nanopore","strains","countries","Radiographic abnormality","fever","Interpretation","Methods","study","Findings","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a highly dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding.

The outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 2019) has caused a global health emergency. Identification of regions with high risk for COVID 19 outbreak is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak and identify areas with a high risk of human infection with virus in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS) based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID 19 in Fars Province, Iran. The daily observations of infected cases was tested in the third-degree polynomial and the autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors including minimum temperature of coldest month (MTCM), maximum temperature of warmest month (MTWM), precipitation in wettest month (PWM), precipitation of driest month (PDM), distance from roads, distance from mosques, distance from hospitals, distance from fuel stations, human footprint, density of cities, distance from bus stations, distance from banks, distance from bakeries, distance from attraction sites, distance from automated teller machines (ATMs), and density of villages were selected for spatial modelling. The predictive ability of an SVM model was assessed using the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) validation technique. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) a good prediction of change detection. The growth rate (GR) average for active cases in Fars for a period of 41 days was 1.26, whilst it was 1.13 in country and the world. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARMA models revealed an increasing trend for GR with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although an explosive growth of the infected cases is expected in the country. The results of this study might assist better programming COVID 19 disease prevention and control and gaining sorts of predictive capability would have wide ranging benefits.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pourghasemi, H.

Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays. Results Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. Conclusions Here we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holland, Mitchell; Negr\u00F3n, Daniel; Mitchell, Shane; Dellinger, Nate; Ivancich, Mychal; Barrus, Tyler; Thomas, Sterling; Jennings, Katharine W.; Goodwin, Bruce; Sozhamannan, Shanmuga","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef8d7fc2fbc21c567502d5dbedc78d2e1b80d990.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bombali Ebolavirus"],"organizations":["PCR","BOMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["designed assays","new assays","design PCR assays","BioLaboro","efficacy of existing PCR assays","BOMV genomes","failure of molecular detection assays","BOMV signatures","available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays","available complete genome sequences of BOMV","silico detection accuracy","silico criteria","silico approaches","signature regions","new primer","given pathogen genome","rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data","successful detection","hours","therapeutics","specific primer","SARS-CoV","false positive hits","true positive hits","novel Coronavirus disease","real-world use cases","effectiveness of existing diagnostics","perfect matches","bioinformatics system","effective diagnostics","probe sequences","nucleoprotein gene","glycoprotein gene","generation sequencing technologies","limited bioinformatics experience","biologists","global society","user-friendly graphical user interface","need","infectious diseases","Bombali Ebolavirus","public health community\u2019s preparedness","significant threat","Recent advances","outbreak","COVID","capability","pathogens","Background Emerging","sensitivity","viruses","mutations","sample","development","deployment","Results","specificity","near neighbors","propensity","instances","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Preliminary data from China indicated a substantial impact on mental health by the pandemic and its associated lockdown measures. Such measures are unprecedented for the majority of people and may affect their lives tremendously. The current survey was developed to assess mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany. Methods We conducted a web-based self-report survey including various aspects of mental health (e.g. PHQ-D, PHQ-4, WHO-5 and comparative questions on a 5-point Likert scale concerning sleep, irritability \u0026 interpersonal violence). First wave data were taken during the height of lockdown measures in Germany from 1 April to 15 April 2020. Results A total of 3,545 volunteers took part in this cross-sectional survey. Mean age was 40.36 years (SD = 11.70; 83.1% female, 15.2% male). Acute or chronic disease was reported by 36.7% (physical) and 24.7% (mental) of subjects. Participants scored mild severity distress in the PHQ stress module. Depression and anxiety as assessed by PHQ-4 was significantly higher than in reference samples. The mean well-being score (WHO-5) was 50.7, thus pointing towards possible signs of depression. Furthermore, we found significant gender differences for anxiety and depression with women showing higher levels. 45.3% of participants reported worsened sleep, increased levels of irritation, anger and aggression compared to pre-pandemic times. Most importantly, 5% of all participants reported experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV). Discussion This is one of the first and largest surveys on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in a European society reflecting a relatively well educated and financially secure sample. Yet, there is evidence for a substantial mental burden with increased levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and irritability.

Little is known about such ancient epidemics and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the Great Plague. Host genomes however offer an indirect way to detect ancient epidemics beyond the current temporal and physical limits. Arms races with pathogens have shaped the genomes of the hosts by driving a large number of adaptations at many genes, and these signals can be used to detect and further characterize ancient epidemics. Here, we detect the genomic footprints left by ancient viral epidemics that took place in the past ~50,000 years in the 26 human populations represented in the 1,000 Genomes Project. By using the enrichment in signals of adaptation at ~4,500 host loci that interact with specific types of viruses, we provide evidence that RNA viruses have driven a particularly large number of adaptive events across diverse human populations. These results suggest that different types of viruses may have exerted different selective pressures during human evolution.

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest.

Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 \u00B0C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (\u003C10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign sustainable products.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Oisik; Neisiany, Rasoul Esmaeely; Capezza, Antonio Jose; Hedenqvist, Mikael S.; F\u00F6rsth, Michael; Xu, Qiang; Jiang, Lin; Ji, Dongxiao; Ramakrishna, Seeram","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/006fc3c1e13bd5cfc309dd990fa45e874db6aa11.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720331314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720331314?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gluten-based masks","gluten material","gluten plastics","films of flexible gluten","wheat gluten biopolymer","injection moulded gluten","shortage of facemasks","billions of facemasks","raw materials","sustainable way","carbonised mat","benign sustainable products","essential workers","essential commodity","stream products of local industries","filter media","carbon mat","future pandemic preparedness","low amounts of lanosol","onset of coronavirus pandemic","co-product of cereal industries","healthcare providers","by-product","single use","microbe resistance","vertical burn test","personal protective equipment","better efficiency","reinforcement","environmental pollution","rating","disposal","electrospun","plasticiser","general public","petrochemicals","conventional ones","hot press","transmittance of infectious diseases","supply","demand","regard","nanofibre membranes","network structure","risk of infection","damage","substance","wt","nations","light","adapters","creation","COVID"],"language":"en"},

We applied high-throughput genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to 75% of cases in the State of Victoria (population 6.24 million) in Australia. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected through active case finding and contact tracing. A dedicated SARS-CoV-2 multidisciplinary genomic response team was formed to enable rapid integration of epidemiological and genomic data. Phylodynamic analysis was performed to assess the putative impact of social restrictions. RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships. Sequencing of sequential samples from 98 patients revealed minimal intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Phylodynamic modelling indicated a significant reduction in the effective viral reproductive number (Re) from 1.63 to 0.48 after the implementation of travel restrictions and population-level physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive framework for the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomics in public health responses.

We projected that mortality would have been 4.6-fold what was observed had physical distancing measures not been implemented in the province. Relaxation of physical distancing measures without compensatory increases in case detection, isolation, and/or contact tracing was projected to result in resurgence of disease activity. Return to normal or near-normal levels of contact would rapidly result in cases exceeding ICU capacity. Maintaining physical distancing for a longer period of time, allowing for the initial wave of infections to subside, delayed this resurgence, but the level of contacts post-restrictive distancing was the major factor determining how quickly ICU capacity was expected to be overwhelmed. Using a model, we demonstrate the marked impact strong public health measures had in reducing ICU admissions and mortality in Ontario. We also show that this hard-earned success is tenuous: relaxation of physical distancing measures in the near-term is projected to result in a rapid resurgence of disease activity.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuite, A.; Greer, A.

Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Objective. To determine the demographic and pre-existing clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. Design. Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Setting. A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. Participants. All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N=442). Results. Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P\u003C0.001), male (OR 2.0, P=0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P=0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P=0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P=0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P\u003C0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction\u003C0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P=0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusion. In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ebinger, J. E.; Achamallah, N.; Ji, H.; Claggett, B.

Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity.

To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs, plus a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, bacterial, and viral profiling. We applied both technologies across 857 SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and 86 NYC subway samples, providing a broad molecular portrait of the COVID-19 NYC outbreak. Our results define new features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, nominate a novel, NYC-enriched viral subclade, reveal specific host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways, and examine risks associated with use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits.

This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xi, Jin; Xu, Kangli; Jiang, Penglei; Lian, Jiangshan; Hao, Shaorui; Jia, Hongyu; Yao, Hangping; Zhang, Yimin; Zheng, Ruoheng; Chen, Dong; Yao, Jinmei; Hu, Jianhua; Gao, Jianguo; Shen, Jian; Wen, Liang; Ren, Yue; Yu, Guodong; Wang, Xiaoyan; Lu, Yingfeng; Yu, Xiaopeng; Yu, Liang; Xiang, Dairong; Zheng, Lin; Wu, Nanping; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Liu, Fumin; Wu, Haibo; Jin, Changzhong; Yang, Xiaofeng; Qian, Pengxu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Yida","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14c2c535373fe6727127b820fb86f55d0f91a41d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSCU","FCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZJ01","SARS-CoV","FCS formation","Furin level","source of FCS sequence-PRRA","strain of SARS","mild COVID","confirmed COVID","evolutionary pattern of SARS","potential evolutionary branch of SARS","critical type","prediction of Furin cleavage site","TT type","binding capacity of Furin","gene alignment","ACE2-Furin co-expression results","sequence alignment of virus family","increased liver","kidney damage","virus dissemination","specific gene mutation","RSCU heat map results","important site of coronavirus evolution","prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity","decreased rate of severe","electrostatic distribution","S protein surface","phylogenetic analysis","Single cell sequencing","patients","OC43","differentiating","influenza","colon","clinical symptom","HKU","existence","body","glands","base","structure","strains of viruses","subtypes","sites","mutations","F1","underlining mechanism","changes","Wuhan","world","positions","organs"],"language":"en"},

In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc... The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions.

However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be less than 13%. If only 1/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 sought care, the ILI surge would correspond to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silverman, Justin D; Hupert, Nathaniel; Washburne, Alex D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9af82ab15c96ec049b8766fa2d5db9d3d27c3461.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050542","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of SARS","ILI surge","new SARS-CoV","excess ILI counts","detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV","early detection","syndromic case detection rate of SARS","number of excess ILI patients","surge of non-influenza ILI","COVID case counts","true prevalence of SARS","early epidemic","existence of infections","COVID epidemic","RT-PCR testing","early cases","large population of infected patients","date of onset","seroprevalence data","syndromic time series","outpatient surveillance data","available CDC influenza","moderate clinical symptoms","illness","broader potential","previous years","fever","alternative presentation","bottlenecks","country","seasonal average","sought care","under-counting","standard cough","conceptual model","community transmission","emerging infectious diseases","rapid spread","findings","importance","results","failure","week period","states","days"],"language":"en"},

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1\u00B0C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carleton, Tamma; Meng, Kyle C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78004aeae61aa940bc2f090a560556d5601358ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northern Hemisphere","Southern Hemisphere"],"keyphrases":["average COVID","transmission patterns","northern countries","southern countries","wave of COVID","greater transmission","Northern Hemisphere countries","Southern Hemisphere countries","confirmed new COVID","precipitation influence transmission","local temperature","role of temperature","coming months","constructions of expected seasonal temperatures","cases","relationship","public health responses","public health capacity","approaching warmer months","confounding factors","global sample","correlated factors","global scale","boreal winter approaches","robust statistical evidence","statistical approach separates effects of climate variation","differences","crucial window of opportunity","C increase","contagion","heterogeneous population densities","aid","specific humidity","causal estimates","policy interventions","exhibits seasonality","findings","novel coronavirus","paper","world","country","projections","contrast"],"language":"en"},

However, in human monocytic ehrlichiosis, respiratory signs are common and signs of interstitial pneumonia are well known. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is classified based on the underlying disease and its treatment is aimed at reducing the clinical signs and, if possible, addressing the primary disease process. PH is often irreversible, but can be reversible if it is secondary to a treatable underlying etiology. CME is currently not generally recognized as one of the possible diseases leading to interstitial pneumonia and secondary PH in dogs. Only one case of PH associated with CME has been reported worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION: A seven-year-old, male intact, mixed breed dog was presented with 2 weeks history of lethargy and dyspnea. The dog previously lived in the Cape Verdean islands. Physical examination showed signs of right-sided congestive heart failure and poor peripheral perfusion. Thoracic radiography showed moderate right-sided cardiomegaly with dilation of the main pulmonary artery and a mild diffuse interstitial lung pattern with peribronchial cuffing. Echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated pressure gradient of 136 mm Hg. On arterial blood gas analysis, severe hypoxemia was found and complete blood count revealed moderate regenerative anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. A severe gamma hyperglobulinemia was also documented. Serology for Ehrlichia canis was highly positive. Treatment with oxygen supplementation, a typed packed red blood cell transfusion and medical therapy with doxycycline, pimobendan and sildenafil was initiated and the dog improved clinically. Approximately 2 weeks later, there was complete resolution of all clinical signs and marked improvement of the PH. CONCLUSION: This report illustrates that CME might be associated with significant pulmonary disease and should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in dogs presenting with dyspnea and secondary pulmonary hypertension, especially in dogs that have been in endemic areas. This is important because CME is a treatable disease and its secondary lung and cardiac manifestations may be completely reversible.","publish_time":"2016-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toom, Marjolein Lisette den; Dobak, Tetyda Paulina; Broens, Els Marion; Valtolina, Chiara","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb87c25391cf7493b664f98408bc230ce97198fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4937533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937533/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CME"],"locations":["Cape Verdean"],"keyphrases":["clinical signs","CME","signs of right","respiratory signs","dogs","severe pulmonary hypertension","secondary pulmonary hypertension","secondary PH","radiographic signs of interstitial pneumonia","significant pulmonary disease","secondary lung","treatable disease","underlying disease","case of PH","severe hypoxemia","severe thrombocytopenia","main pulmonary artery","complete blood count","dyspnea","severe gamma hyperglobulinemia","possible diseases","primary disease process","treatment","mild diffuse interstitial lung pattern","moderate right-sided cardiomegaly","canine monocytic ehrlichiosis","human monocytic ehrlichiosis","mixed breed dog","possible differential diagnosis","treatable underlying etiology","arterial blood gas analysis","complete resolution","CASE PRESENTATION","typed packed red blood cell transfusion","moderate regenerative anemia","weeks history of lethargy","sided congestive heart failure","medical therapy","dilation","doxycycline","poor peripheral perfusion","estimated pressure gradient","oxygen supplementation","peribronchial cuffing","year-old","Thoracic radiography","marked improvement","cardiac manifestations","pimobendan","sildenafil","CONCLUSION","Physical examination","Serology","Ehrlichia canis","Hg","BACKGROUND","Echocardiography","Cape Verdean islands","endemic areas","report"],"language":"en"},

A strategy for influenza A virus\u2010induction of a reporter gene was recently described. In this report, we describe the extension of this strategy to influenza B virus, the generation of stable cell lines with influenza A and B virus\u2010inducible reporter genes, and the use of these cells in various clinically relevant viral assays. Each of the cell lines described herein constitutively express an RNA transcript that contains a reporter gene coding region flanked by viral 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010untranslated regions (UTR) and therefore mimics an influenza virus genomic segment. Upon infection of the cells with influenza virus the virus\u2010inducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS) is replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex resulting in reporter gene expression. Findings Reporter gene induction occurs after infection with a number of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus including several H5N1 strains. The induction is dose\u2010dependent and highly specific for influenza A or influenza B viruses. Conclusions These cell lines provide the basis of simple, rapid, and objective assays that involve virus quantitation such as determination of viral titer, assessment of antiviral susceptibility, and determination of antibody neutralization titer.

(2011) Annual influenza vaccination: coverage and attitudes of primary care staff in Australia. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(2), 135\u2013141. Background Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all Australian health care workers (HCWs) including those working in primary health care. There is limited published data on coverage, workplace provision, attitudes and personal barriers to influenza vaccination amongst primary health care staff. The aim of this study was to contribute to the limited literature base in this important area by investigating these issues in the primary health care setting in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods A postal survey was sent to general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs) from inner city, semi\u2010urban and rural areas of NSW, Australia. There were 139 responses in total (response rate 36%) from 79 GPs (response rate 30%) and 60 PNs (response rate 46%). Results Reported influenza vaccination coverage in both 2007 and 2008 was greater than 70%, with GPs reporting higher coverage than PNs in both years. The main barriers identified were lack of awareness of vaccination recommendations for general practice staff and concern about adverse effects from the vaccine. Conclusions Rates of influenza vaccination coverage reported in this study were higher than in previous studies of hospital and institutional HCWs, though it is possible that the study design may have contributed to these higher results. Nevertheless, these findings highlight that more needs to be done to understand barriers to vaccination in this group, to inform the development of appropriate strategies to increase vaccination coverage in primary health care staff, with a special focus on PNs.","publish_time":"2010-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, Kirsten; Seale, Holly; Zwar, Nicholas; Leask, Julie; MacIntyre, C.

Under- or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.","publish_time":"2016-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pe\u00F1a, Jos\u00E9; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Allen, Jonathan E.; Hwang, Mona; Elsheikh, Maher; Mabery, Shalini; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle; Zemla, Adam T.; Bowen, Richard A.; Borucki, Monica K.","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d2201d0059d6b9e0702278a74cb46e036434053.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4989884.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased viral virulence","development of viral virulence","viral titer","viral factors","Viral population dynamics","increased virulence","serial passage of","viral mutant spectrum diversity","host species","role of viral mutant spectra dynamics","host immunocompetence","increased pathogenicity","nutritional status of mice","differing nutritional status","global population","development of pathogenicity","passaged virus","majority","consensus sequences","groups of mice","polymerase genes","D plaque","virulent phenotype","Sendai virus","deep sequence analysis","presence of persistent high frequency variants","diet of animal model","cytokine assays","non-synonymous changes","dysregulated immune response","transmission","extremes of diets","clone","N1124D change","computational modeling","Histopathology","precise mechanism","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","overnutrition","N genotype","malnutrition","obesity","guinea pigs","study","comparison","Sequencing","viruses","objective","animals"],"language":"en"},

Some lymphomas have a very rapid fulminant course. HHV-8 has also been reported to be a cause of lymphoma. The role of CMV in the development of lymphoma is not clear, though both CMV and HHV-8 have been reported in tissues adjacent to the tumour in Burkitt lymphoma patients. Here we present a patient with asymptomatic HIV infection, that contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. Three weeks before onset of symptoms the patient had unprotected sex which could be possible source of his CMV and also HHV-8 infection He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). METHODS: A Caucasian homosexual male with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Clinical and laboratory records were compiled. Immunohistochemistry was performed on lymphoid tissues, a liver biopsy, a bone marrow aspirate and the spleen during the illness and at autopsy. Serology and PCR for HIV, CMV, EBV, HHV-1\u20133 and 6\u20138 was performed on blood drawn during the course of disease. RESULTS: The patient presented with an acute primary CMV infection. Biopsies taken 2 weeks before death showed a small focus of ALCL in one lymph node of the neck. Autopsy demonstrated a massive infiltration of ALCL in lymph nodes, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Blood samples confirmed primary CMV- infection, a HHV-8 infection together with reactivation of Epstein- Barr-virus (EBV). CONCLUSION: Primary CMV-infection and concomitant HHV-8 infection correlated with reactivation of EBV. We propose that these two viruses influenced the development and progression of the lymphoma. Quantitative PCR blood analysis for EBV, CMV and HHV-8 could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of this type of very rapidly developing lymphoma. It is also a reminder of the importance of prevention and prophylaxis of several infections by having protected sex.","publish_time":"2016-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gr\u00FCtzmeier, Sven; Porwit, Anna; Schmitt, Corinna; Sandstr\u00F6m, Eric; \u00C5kerlund, B\u00F6rje; Ernberg, Ingemar","journal":"Infect Agent Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d87b9206395dd973e9c17b32af6962ce13acf977.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4992999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4992999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein- Barr-virus"],"organizations":["CMV","PCR","EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary CMV- infection","Primary CMV-infection","acute primary CMV infection","asymptomatic HIV infection","role of CMV","concomitant HHV","development of lymphoma","reactivation of EBV","developing lymphoma","cause of lymphoma","primary cytomegalovirus","Burkitt lymphoma patients","human herpes virus","HIV-patients","generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma","asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus","Barr-virus","small focus of ALCL","massive infiltration of ALCL","spleen","reactivation of Epstein","Blood samples","weeks","autopsy","Quantitative PCR blood analysis","bone marrow aspirate","lymph nodes","liver biopsy","unprotected sex","lymphoid tissues","tissues adjacent","malignant lymphomas","course of disease","rapid fulminant course","Caucasian homosexual male","death","tumour","onset of symptoms","possible source","prophylaxis","infections","type","importance of prevention","diagnosis","treatment","METHODS","illness","BACKGROUND","progression","Serology","CONCLUSION","laboratory records","reminder","Immunohistochemistry","viruses","Biopsies","neck","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads, and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.","publish_time":"2015-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaqing; Bergland, Alan O.; Behrman, Emily L.; Gregory, Brian D.; Petrov, Dmitri A.; Schmidt, Paul S.","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/173558a2a7b31fd73e4d89593bde8896efd30a93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5009998.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/33/3/707/17471430/msv263.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozky0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diapause expression","diapause propensity","diapause response","transcriptional regulation of diapause","regulated phenotype","hypothesis","complex phenotype","driving phenotype of climatic adaptation","primary adaptation","ovaries","genes","heads of diapausing flies","oscillating SNPs","natural variation","transcriptional level","multiple tissues","specific tissues","model organism Drosophila melanogaster experience","varying selective pressures","clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism","chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression","heterogeneous environments","short day photoperiod","low temperature","broad geographical ranges","tissue types","endocrine","Wild populations","environmental heterogeneity","global transcriptomic profiling","reproductive quiescence","functional modules","pathways","annual timescales","latitude","season","results","soma"],"language":"en"},

A modified Mantel permutation test showed that the patristic distances of virus and host phylogenies are significantly correlated, especially when the three anomalously placed viruses are removed. When the internal branches of the virus phylogeny were collapsed the congruence decreased. The simplest explanation of this congruence of the virus and host phylogenies is that most tobamovirus lineages have co-diverged with their primary plant hosts for more than 110 million years, and only the brassica-infecting lineage originated from a major host switch from asterids to rosids. Their co-divergence seems to have been \u2018fuzzy\u2019 rather than \u2018strict\u2019, permitting viruses to switch hosts within major host clades.

We undertook a clinical study at the National Paediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh to evaluate clinical diagnostic parameters for dengue and predictors of disease outcome. METHODS: Between September 2011 and January 2013, all consecutive inpatients aged between 1 and 15 years and presenting with suspected dengue were enrolled. They were clinically assessed using both the 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue classifications. Specimens were collected upon admission and discharge and tested for dengue at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. RESULTS: A total of 701 patients were screened. Of these, 79 % were dengue-confirmed by laboratory testing, and 21 % tested dengue-negative. A positive tourniquet test, absence of upper respiratory symptoms, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases were independent predictors for laboratory-confirmed dengue among the children. The presence of several warning signs on hospital admission was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of two or more warning signs was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe dengue at hospital admission. Thus, a cumulative score combining simple clinical parameters and first-line laboratory findings could be used to accurately predict dengue virus infection in pediatric populations, optimizing triage in settings with limited laboratory resources.

Antibody detection (serology) can reveal both past and recent infections. There is a great need for development of rational ways of detecting and quantifying antibodies, both for humans and animals. Traditionally, serology using synthetic antigens covers linear epitopes using up to 30 amino acid peptides. Methods: We here report that peptides of 100 amino acids or longer (\u201Cmegapeptides\u201D), designed and synthesized for optimal serological performance, can successfully be used as detection antigens in a suspension multiplex immunoassay (SMIA). Megapeptides can quickly be created just from pathogen sequences. A combination of rational sequencing and bioinformatic routines for definition of diagnostically-relevant antigens can, thus, rapidly yield efficient serological diagnostic tools for an emerging infectious pathogen. Results: We designed megapeptides using bioinformatics and viral genome sequences. These long peptides were tested as antigens for the presence of antibodies in human serum to the filo-, herpes-, and polyoma virus families in a multiplex microarray system. All of these virus families contain recently discovered or emerging infectious viruses.

Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. We find a highly refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the \u201CL-A\u201D totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon. Thus, Xrn1p appears to co-evolve with totiviruses to maintain its potent antiviral activity and limit viral propagation in Saccharomyces yeasts. We demonstrate that Xrn1p physically interacts with the Gag protein encoded by the L-A virus, suggesting a host-virus interaction that is more complicated than just Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs.","publish_time":"2016-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rowley, Paul A.; Ho, Brandon; Bushong, Sarah; Johnson, Arlen; Sawyer, Sara L.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ee1c7181e45a196ce3e91a128cc64426fa6de5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5053509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. kudriavzevii"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Xrn1p orthologs","host-virus interaction","Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs","high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence","totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species","viral propagation","RNA degradation","Saccharomyces yeasts","cerevisiae","kudriavzevii","Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate","degradation of cellular mRNAs","sequence differences","Gag protein","host exonucleases","gene XRN1","potent antiviral activity","antiviral defense mechanism","adaptive immunity","canonical caps","tails","poly","parasite","differential interactions","eukaryotes","species-specific relationship","Ty1 retrotransposon","cytoplasmic exosome"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear.

In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood.

Current diagnostic methods to support HBoV detection include polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay using recombinant VP2 or virus-like particle capsid proteins, although sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms promise rapid and simultaneous detection of the pathogens in the future. This review presents the current knowledge on HBoV genotypes with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship and genomic analysis, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods. The emerging discussion on HBoVs as true pathogen or innocent bystander is also emphasized.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guido, Marcello; Tumolo, Maria Rosaria; Verri, Tiziano; Romano, Alessandro; Serio, Francesca; De Giorgi, Mattia; De Donno, Antonella; Bagordo, Francesco; Zizza, Antonella","journal":"World J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/046b480f92a27f809d67c98c77752037f3342d2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5075545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV infection","HBoV detection","HBoV genotypes","HBoV isolate","HBoV pathogenicity","respiratory samples","acute respiratory infection","HBoVs","gastroenteric pathogen infection","Current diagnostic methods","viral capsid proteins","particle capsid proteins","enzyme immunoassay","simultaneous detection","true pathogen","recombinant VP2","stool samples","current knowledge","Human bocavirus","human faeces","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses","real-time PCR","biology","taxonomy","emphasis","polymerase chain reaction","genomic analysis","phylogenetic relationship","epidemiology","generation sequencing platforms","sequence-independent amplification techniques","NS1","nucleotides","pathogenesis","mo of age","HBoV2","difficulties","NP1","pathogens","emerging discussion","innocent bystander","HBoV1","early life","fact","nuclear phosphoprotein","cell cultures","lack of animal models","open reading frames","HBoV3","non-structural protein","children","patients","gastroenteritis","parvovirus","VP1","review","HBoV4"],"language":"en"},

Likewise, its potential value as a marker of severity, which is well established in patients with pneumonia, remains unproven in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. METHODS: A cohort study of 118 patients with severe COPD and acute infectious exacerbations were included and followed up over 1 year. Episodes of exacerbations meeting Anthonisen\u2019s criteria type I\u2013II were evaluated, analyzing the etiology and inflammatory response as measured by CRP in blood. RESULTS: A total of 380 episodes were recorded. Full microbiological analysis was available in 265 samples. Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly isolated bacteria and rhinovirus the most common virus. Median CRP levels from the 265 episodes were higher in the cases with positive cultures for bacteria (58.30 mg/L, interquartile range [IQR] 21.0\u201328.2) than in episodes only positive for viruses (37.3 mg/L, IQR 18.6\u201379.1) and cases negative for any microorganism (36.4 mg/L, IQR 10.8\u201393.7) (P\u003C0.014). H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae reached the highest CRP levels of 74.5 mg/L (IQR 23.9\u2013167.9) and 74.1 mg/L (IQR 42.0\u2013220.7), respectively. In the 380 exacerbations studied, 227 (~60%) were community-managed, while 153 (~40%) required hospital admission. In the multivariate analysis to assess the influence of inflammatory response on exacerbation severity, baseline hypercapnia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46\u20134.9) and CRP levels \u003E100 mg/L (OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 2.12\u20138.44) were independent predictors after adjustment for baseline characteristics. CONCLUSION: CRP level was higher in bacterial infections, especially when H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were isolated. CRP values \u003E100 mg/L were associated with a fourfold increased risk of hospital admission. Therefore, CRP blood levels may be a useful biomarker in the management of exacerbations appearing in patients with severe disease.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallego, Miguel; Pomares, Xavier; Capilla, Silvia; Marcos, Maria Angeles; Su\u00E1rez, David; Mons\u00F3, Eduard; Mont\u00F3n, Concepci\u00F3n","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb65c5259727bce9f1623452a0af39aa57f9b1bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5085274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IQR","CRP blood levels","CRP values","highest CRP levels","Median CRP levels","management of exacerbations","patients","acute infectious exacerbations","Episodes of exacerbations meeting Anthonisen\u2019s criteria","severe COPD","severe disease","isolated bacteria","cases","Haemophilus influenzae","CI","influence of inflammatory response","exacerbation severity","baseline hypercapnia","baseline characteristics","marker of severity","Streptococcus pneumoniae","positive cultures","microbiological analysis","predicting etiology","multivariate analysis","fourfold increased risk of hospital admission","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","useful biomarker","measurement","bacterial infections","C-reactive protein","odds ratio","cohort study","independent predictors","adjustment","rhinovirus","usefulness","common virus","BACKGROUND","samples","potential value","CONCLUSION","METHODS","confidence interval","RESULTS","total","interquartile range","viruses","microorganism","year","community"],"language":"en"},

The administration of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM), which has both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities, improves outcomes and respiratory function in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, we conducted a prospective clinical study to examine the effects of rhTM on respiratory function, coagulation markers, and outcomes for patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: After registration of the protocol, the patients with AE-IPF who satisfied the study inclusion criteria were treated daily with 380 U/kg of rhTM for 7 days and steroid pulse therapy. The concomitant administration of immunosuppressants and polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column treatment was prohibited. The sample size was 10 subjects. The primary study outcome was the improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio a week after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were change in D-dimer level over time and 28-day survival rate in patients without intubation. Study data were compared with historical untreated comparison group, including 13 patients with AE-IPF who were treated without rhTM before the registration. RESULTS: The mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for the rhTM treatment group (n = 10) on day 8 significantly improved compared with that on day one (two-way analysis of variance, p = 0.01). The mean D-dimer level tended to decrease in the rhTM group on day 8, but the change was not significant. The 28-day survival rate was 50 % higher in the rhTM group than in the historical untreated comparison group, but the difference was not significant. A post hoc analysis showed that overall survival time was significantly longer in the treated group compared with that of the historical untreated comparison group (p = 0.04, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: rhTM plus steroid pulse therapy improves respiratory functions in patients with AE-IPF and is expected to improve overall patient survival without using other combination therapies.

E. chaffeensis has a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism and thus depends mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for growth. Although the host cell cytoplasm is rich with these nutrients, as E. chaffeensis is confined within the early endosome-like membrane-bound compartment, only host nutrients that enter the compartment can be used by this bacterium. How this occurs is unknown. We found that ehrlichial replication depended on autophagy induction involving class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) activity, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG5 (autophagy-related 5). Ehrlichia acquired host cell preincorporated amino acids in a class III PtdIns3K-dependent manner and ehrlichial growth was enhanced by treatment with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. Moreover, ATG5 and RAB5A/B/C were routed to ehrlichial inclusions. RAB5A/B/C siRNA knockdown, or overexpression of a RAB5-specific GTPase-activating protein or dominant-negative RAB5A inhibited ehrlichial infection, indicating the critical role of GTP-bound RAB5 during infection. Both native and ectopically expressed ehrlichial type IV secretion effector protein, Etf-1, bound RAB5 and the autophagy-initiating class III PtdIns3K complex, PIK3C3/VPS34, and BECN1, and homed to ehrlichial inclusions. Ectopically expressed Etf-1 activated class III PtdIns3K as in E. chaffeensis infection and induced autophagosome formation, cleared an aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin protein in a class III PtdIns3K-dependent manner, and enhanced ehrlichial proliferation. These data support the notion that E. chaffeensis secretes Etf-1 to induce autophagy to repurpose the host cytoplasm and capture nutrients for its growth through RAB5 and class III PtdIns3K, while avoiding autolysosomal killing.","publish_time":"2016-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Mingqun; Liu, Hongyan; Xiong, Qingming; Niu, Hua; Cheng, Zhihui; Yamamoto, Akitsugu; Rikihisa, Yasuko","journal":"Autophagy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/284541395ddc07d44ccd2d3da2ba060505a01407.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5103349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5103349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ehrlichia","Ectopically"],"organizations":["III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ehrlichial growth","host nutrients","ehrlichial inclusions","autophagy-initiating class","ehrlichial type","chaffeensis infection","ehrlichial replication","PtdIns3K complex","bound RAB5","activated class","host cytoplasm","Ehrlichia chaffeensis","PtdIns3K-dependent manner","host-synthesized nutrients","enhanced ehrlichial proliferation","host cell cytoplasm","Etf","autophagy induction","autophagy inducer","dominant-negative RAB5A inhibited ehrlichial infection","capture nutrients","RAB5-specific GTPase","membrane-bound compartment","BECN1","ATG5","secretion effector protein","aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin protein","C siRNA knockdown","obligatory intracellular bacterium","fatal emerging zoonosis","overexpression","PIK3C3","critical role of GTP","amino acids","induced autophagosome formation","human monocytic ehrlichiosis","kinase","treatment","phosphatidylinositol","early endosome","limited capacity","biosynthesis","metabolism","activity","VPS34","rapamycin","Beclin","notion","data","autolysosomal"],"language":"en"},

The first line of defense against pathogens is the innate immune response. In the case of a viral infection, it induces the interferon (IFN) signaling cascade and eventually the expression of type I IFN, which then causes an antiviral state in the cells. However, many viruses have developed strategies to counteract this mechanism and prevent the production of IFN. In order to modulate or inhibit the IFN signaling cascade in their favor, viruses have found ways to interfere at every single step of the cascade, for example, by inducing protein degradation or cleavage, or by mediate protein polyubiquitination.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang \uFEFF\uFEFF(1-7)) and counter-regulates the classical axis of RAS. We have investigated the expression and distribution of ACE-2 in post-mortem human brain tissue in relation to AD pathology and classical RAS axis activity. METHODS: We measured ACE-2 activity by fluorogenic peptide substrate assay in mid-frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) in a cohort of AD (n = 90) and age-matched non-demented controls (n = 59) for which we have previous data on ACE-1 activity, amyloid \u03B2 (A\u03B2) level and tau pathology, as well as known ACE1 (rs1799752) indel polymorphism, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity scores. RESULTS: ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in AD compared with age-matched controls (P \u003C 0.0001) and correlated inversely with levels of A\u03B2 (r = \u22120.267, P \u003C 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology (r = \u22120.327, P \u003C 0.01). ACE-2 was reduced in individuals possessing an APOE \u03B54 allele (P \u003C 0.05) and was associated with ACE1 indel polymorphism (P \u003C 0.05), with lower ACE-2 activity in individuals homozygous for the ACE1 insertion AD risk allele. ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with ACE-1 activity (r = \u22120.453, P \u003C 0.0001), and the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 was significantly elevated in AD (P \u003C 0.0001). Finally, we show that the ratio of Ang II to Ang (1\u20137) (a proxy measure of ACE-2 activity indicating conversion of Ang II to Ang (1\u20137)) is reduced in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings indicate that ACE-2 activity is reduced in AD and is an important regulator of the central classical ACE-1/Ang II/AT1R axis of RAS, and also that dysregulation of this pathway likely plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.

The country is known as endemic for malaria and respiratory infections. The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SCD; the secondary objective was to evaluate its association with malaria and respiratory infections. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study which was carried out in a rural village in the south east coast of Madagascar between May 2011 and November 2013. Participants were children aged between 2\u201359 months presenting with fever measured by axillary temperature \u226537.5 \u00B0C at inclusion. Genotyping of haemoglobin S was done by PCR and malaria was diagnosed by Rapid Diagnostic Test. Research for viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Uni-and multivariate polytomous logistic regression was done to assess associations between microbiological results and SCD status, with HbAA phenotype as reference. RESULTS: A total of 807 children were analysed. Prevalence of SCD among febrile children was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.5\u20133.7%) and that of SCT was 23.8% (95% CI, 20.9\u201326.9%). There was no difference in the prevalence of malaria infection according to haemoglobin status (p = 0.3). Rhinovirus (22.5%), adenovirus (14.1%), and bocavirus (11.6%) were the most common respiratory pathogens detected. After univariate analysis, patients with SCD were more frequently infected by parechovirus (p = 0.01), while patients with SCT were more prone to RSV A or B infection (p = 0.01). After multivariate analysis, HbAS phenotype was associated with higher risk of RSV A and B infection compared to HbAA (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2\u20133.1, p = 0.009), while HbSS phenotype was associated with higher risk of parechovirus infection (adjusted OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 1.1\u201331.3, p = 0.03) compared to HbAA, independently of age, gender, period per quarter, and the other viruses. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SCD among under-five children presenting with fever was high in the study population. No association was found between SCT and malaria but few viruses, especially parechovirus, seem to play an important role in the occurrence of pneumoniae among SCD patients.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maeder, Muriel N.; Rabezanahary, Henintsoa M.; Zafindraibe, Norosoa J.; Randriatiana, Martin Raoelina; Rasamoelina, Tahinamandranto; Rakotoarivo, Andry T.; Vanhems, Philippe; Hoffmann, Jonathan; B\u00E9net, Thomas; Rakoto Andrianarivelo, Mala; Rakoto-Alson, Olivat A.","journal":"BMC Hematol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c6ca63f974a55bcab6f773fc9cda85c938b93eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5134128.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCD","Rapid Diagnostic","SCT","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of SCD","SCD patients","SCD status","prevalence of malaria infection","B infection","HbAA phenotype","respiratory infections","SCT","higher risk of parechovirus infection","under-five children","study population","cross-sectional study","febrile children","common respiratory pathogens","higher risk of RSV","haemoglobin status","fever","atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens","HbAS phenotype","HbSS phenotype","multivariate analysis","viruses","microbiological results","secondary objective","univariate analysis","main objective","Genotyping of haemoglobin S","south east coast of Madagascar","multivariate polytomous logistic regression","Research","associations","occurrence of pneumoniae","sickle cell disease","rural village","quarter","axillary temperature","gender","PCR","endemic","important role","nasopharyngeal swabs","period","months","reference","difference","inclusion","METHODS","country","total","CONCLUSION","Rhinovirus","adenovirus","BACKGROUND","Participants","bocavirus"],"language":"en"},

The difference between IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03BB signaling remains poorly understood. Here, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we examine the role of STAT1 and STAT2 in the inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03BB. Treatment with IFN-\u03B1 increases expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and decreases viral RNA and protein levels in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells. These responses are only partially attenuated by knockout of STAT1 but are abolished by knockout of STAT2. In contrast, the inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-\u03BB is abolished by knockout of STAT1 or STAT2. Microarray analysis reveals that IFN-\u03B1 but not IFN-\u03BB can induce expression of the majority of ISGs in STAT1 knockout cells.

The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), due to its abundance, sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals, and highly social behavioral ecology, may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission. Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera. Positive results were found for rhabdovirus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus assays. We also screened these samples for Bartonella spp. and found that 38% of individuals tested positive. To characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated with feeding behavior, we also analyzed cytochrome B sequences from fecal samples to identify prey species and found that domestic cattle (Bos taurus) made up the majority of blood meals. Our findings suggest that the risk of pathogen spillover from Desmodus rotundus, including between domestic animal species, is possible and warrants further investigation to characterize this microbial diversity and expand our understanding of foraging ecology in their populations.

They signal through the Janus kinases (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway and promote an antiviral state by the induction of expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Contrary to type I IFNs, the effect of IFN-\u03BB cytokines is largely limited to epithelial cells due to the restricted pattern of expression of their specific receptor. Several genome-wide association studies have established a strong correlation between polymorphism in the region of IL-28B gene (encoding for IFN-\u03BB3) and both spontaneous and therapeutic IFN-mediated clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the mechanism(s) underlying this enhanced viral clearance are not fully understood. IFN-\u03BB3 directly inhibits HCV replication, and in vitro studies suggest that polymorphism in the IFN-\u03BB3 and its recently identified overlapping IFN-\u03BB4 govern the pattern of ISGs induced upon HCV infection of hepatocytes. IFN-\u03BB can also be produced by dendritic cells, and apart from its antiviral action on hepatocytes, it can regulate the inflammatory response of monocytes/macrophages, thus acting at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about the role of IFN-\u03BB cytokines in mediating and regulating the immune response during acute and chronic HCV infections.","publish_time":"2016-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boisvert, Maude; Shoukry, Naglaa H.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c99007bb5431eb6791641103d0da5f30ac80b9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5179541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5179541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03BB3","role of IFN","effect of IFN","IFN-\u03BB2","IFN-\u03BB1","overlapping IFN-\u03BB4","\u03BB cytokines","therapeutic IFN-mediated clearance of hepatitis C virus","HCV infection of hepatocytes","HCV replication","region of IL","\u03BB family of type","pattern of ISGs","chronic HCV infections","antiviral state","polymorphism","restricted pattern of expression","immune response","induction of expression","signal transducers","B gene","epithelial cells","antiviral action","dendritic cells","enhanced viral clearance","inflammatory response of monocytes","interferon-stimulated genes","current state of knowledge","genome-wide association studies","activators of transcription pathway","strong correlation","JAK","mediating","interface","macrophages","mechanism","Janus kinases","specific receptor","related interleukin","adaptive immunity","IFNs"],"language":"en"},

Concurrent infections of dengue and malaria are rare due to the different habitats of its vectors and activities of different carrier mosquitoes. The first case reported was in 2005. Since then, several concurrent infections have been reported between the dengue virus (DENV) and the malaria protozoans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Symptoms of each infection may be masked by a simultaneous second infection, resulting in late treatment and severe complications. Plasmodium knowlesi is also a common cause of malaria in Malaysia with one of the highest rates of mortality. This report is one of the earliest in literature of concomitant infection between DENV and P. knowlesi in which a delay in diagnosis had placed a patient in a life-threatening situation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year old man staying near the Belum-Temengor rainforest at the Malaysia\u2013Thailand border was admitted with fever for 6 days, with respiratory distress. His non-structural protein 1 antigen and Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin M tests were positive. He was treated for severe dengue with compensated shock. Treating the dengue had so distracted the clinicians that a blood film for the malaria parasite was not done. Despite aggressive supportive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient had unresolved acidosis as well as multi-organ failure involving respiratory, renal, liver, and haematological systems. It was due to the presentation of shivering in the ICU, that a blood film was done on the second day that revealed the presence of P. knowlesi with a parasite count of 520,000/\u03BCL. The patient was subsequently treated with artesunate-doxycycline and made a good recovery after nine days in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: This case contributes to the body of literature on co-infection between DENV and P. knowlesi and highlights the clinical consequences, which can be severe. Awareness should be raised among health-care workers on the possibility of dengue-malaria co-infection in this region. Further research is required to determine the real incidence and risk of co-infection in order to improve the management of acute febrile illness.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Soon Eu; Mohamad Zaini, Rhendra Hardy; Suraiya, Siti; Lee, Kok Tong; Lim, Jo Anne","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5210313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","ICU"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["malaria co-infection","severe dengue","malaria parasite","Concurrent infections of dengue","malaria protozoans","Plasmodium knowlesi","possibility of dengue","dengue virus","risk of co-infection","literature of concomitant infection","common cause of malaria","ICU","patient","CASE PRESENTATION","Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin","Malaysia","Plasmodium falciparum","Plasmodium vivax","blood film","days","severe complications","late treatment","different habitats","body of literature","respiratory distress","parasite count","presentation of shivering","intensive care unit","aggressive supportive treatment","health-care workers","highest rates of mortality","activities of different carrier mosquitoes","multi-organ failure","antigen","vectors","Belum-Temengor rainforest","liver","tests","unresolved acidosis","Thailand border","non-structural protein","good recovery","real incidence","year old man","fever","management of acute febrile illness","haematological systems","artesunate-doxycycline","presence of","clinical consequences","delay","diagnosis","compensated shock","clinicians","region","\u03BCL","life-threatening situation","BACKGROUND","Awareness","report","research","CONCLUSIONS","Symptoms"],"language":"en"},

IFNs are host-encoded secreted proteins, which induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties. Among the three classes of IFNs, type III IFNs, also called IFN lambdas (IFNLs), are an essential component of the innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV). In particular, human polymorphisms in IFNL gene loci correlate with hepatitis C disease progression and with treatment response. To date, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly elusive; however it seems clear that viral infection of the liver induces IFNL responses. As IFNL receptors show a more restricted tissue expression than receptors for other classes of IFNs, IFNL treatment has reduced side effects compared to the classical type I IFN treatment. In HCV therapy, however, IFNL will likely not play an important role as highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) exist. Here, we will review our current knowledge on IFNL gene expression, protein properties, signaling, ISG induction, and its implications on HCV infection and treatment.

We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U.S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity.

Environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems, intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific. However, a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, especially bovines and pigs. Future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses.","publish_time":"2017-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Kerstin; Pinho dos Reis, Vin\u00EDcius; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/026447f6e8f25d774926c5f38f8c8ae1f62aa54d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5332953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5332953/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human astroviruses","great diversity of astroviruses","humans","Bats","question of zoonotic potential","tissue tropism of astroviruses","livestock","number of different viruses","great genetic diversity","order Chiroptera","cross species barriers","largest order of mammals","bat populations","diarrhea","children","astrovirus infection dynamics","causative agent","immunocompromised patients","deforestation","ecosystems","Future research activities","contact","wildlife","knowledge","bovines","encephalitis","date","animal","Environmental changes","global distribution","pigs","recent years","overview","long time","neurotropic strains","review"],"language":"en"},

To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically na\u00EFve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18\u201324 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.","publish_time":"2017-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, Robyn N.; Capucci, Lorenzo; Matthaei, Markus; Esposito, Simona; Kerr, Peter J.; Frese, Michael; Strive, Tanja","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31fabefa068bca926a43f94ef80df1daf41aa806.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5348035.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5348035/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RHDV"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["RHDV evolution","virulent RHDV field","characterisation of novel RHDV strains","virus variants","virus population","calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus","used strain","subsequent passages","wild European rabbit","P2 domain","selection","hours post-challenge","altered phenotypes","capsid protein","coding sequence","effectiveness","amino acid substitutions","biocontrol agent","Oryctolagus cuniculus","na\u00EFve laboratory rabbits","neutralising monoclonal antibody","case partial immune escape","populations","concept","cell culture","widespread herd immunity","variant viruses","synonymous substitution","viral polymerase","experimental platform","CAPM V","proof","Australia","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We jointly analysed ILI surveillance data with the timing of school breaks in a temperate district in Beijing, China from 2008 to 2015. ILI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of schoolchildren (5\u201314 and 15\u201324 years of age) to adults (25\u201359 and \u003E60 years of age) were used to measure the age shift of ILI incidence before, during and after the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks. Serfling-based Poisson regression model with adjustment for unmeasured confounders was built to further assess the effect of winter school breaks. RESULTS: ILI incidences were consistently lower during winter breaks than before winter breaks for all age groups. IRRs of younger schoolchildren aged 5\u201314 to adults were higher during winter school breaks than before breaks, while the opposite was true for the IRRs of older schoolchildren aged 15\u201324 to adults. Schoolchildren-to-adults IRRs during summer breaks were significantly lower than before or after school breaks (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both winter and summer breaks were associated with reductions of ILI incidences among schoolchildren and adults. Our study contributes additional evidence on the effects of school breaks on ILI incidence, suggesting school closure could be effective in controlling influenza transmission in developing countries.","publish_time":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Yanhui; Wu, Zhenyu; Ji, Jiayi; Sun, Jingyi; Sun, Xiaoyu; Qin, Guoyou; Qin, Jingning; Xiao, Zheng; Ren, Jian; Qin, Di; Zheng, Xueying; Wang, Xi-Ling","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bab279da548d8bd363acd5033e9dc54e7dbb7107.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5353286.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353286/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["winter breaks","summer school breaks","effects of school breaks","effect of winter school breaks","timing of school breaks","week summer breaks","effects of winter","week winter","adults IRRs","school closure","age shift of ILI incidence","reductions of ILI incidences","IRRs of older schoolchildren","IRRs of younger schoolchildren","ILI incidence rate ratios","years of age","analysed ILI surveillance data","age groups","occurrences of influenza","influenza transmission","adjustment","Serfling-based Poisson regression model","temperate district","unmeasured confounders","additional evidence","Beijing","developing countries","China","study","METHODS","illness","RESULTS","opposite","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This diagnostic study was conducted from January 2014 until June 2015 in three major educational medical centers, Tehran, Iran. For patients selected with diagnosis of septic shock, peripheral blood sample was taken for testing the VBG parameters and the anion gap (AG) was calculated. All the mentioned parameters were measured again after infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h. RESULTS: Totally, 93 patients with septic shock were enrolled, 63 male and 30 female. The mean age was 72.53 \u00B1 13.03 and the mean Shock Index (SI) before fluid therapy was 0.79 \u00B1 0.30. AG and pH showed significant negative correlations with CVP, While HCO3 showed a significant positive correlation with CVP. These relations can be affected by the treatment modalities used in shock management such as fluid therapy, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment. CONCLUSION: It is likely that there is a significant statistical correlation between VBG parameters and AG with CVP, but further research is needed before implementation of the results of this study.","publish_time":"2016-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahim-Taleghani, Sima; Fatemi, Alireza; Alavi Moghaddam, Mostafa; Shojaee, Majid; Abushouk, Abdelrahman Ibrahim; Forouzanfar, Mohammad Mehdi; Baratloo, Alireza","journal":"Turk J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7018967c7ebc76e4c6d3decf7e836957ff427602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5357094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AG","CVP"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["CVP","shock management","VBG parameters","diagnosis of septic shock","mean Shock Index","analysis parameters","mentioned parameters","significant statistical correlation","significant positive correlation","fluid therapy","patients","diagnostic study","RESULTS","venous blood gas","significant negative correlations","vasopressor treatment","treatment modalities","mean age","management of severe sepsis","central venous pressure","peripheral blood sample","HCO3","mechanical ventilation","Tehran","infusion","major educational medical centers","emergency department","Iran","anion gap","cc of normal saline","MATERIAL","METHODS","implementation","research","female","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

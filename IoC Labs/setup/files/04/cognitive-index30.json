As the genome of these virus exist in RNA form, only by profiling the relative abundance of these sgRNAs, can the viral transcriptome be revealed. Utilizing publically available meta-transcriptomic data generated from patient samples, we were able to infer the viral transcriptome in vivo, which is distinct from the in vitro one derived from cell culture. Inter-sample diversity was also observed and a sample specific transcript was identified. By doing the same analysis to MERS and SARS data, we were able to compare the three in terms of transcription. Among the differences, SARS-COV-2 has significantly elevated expression of the Spike gene, which may contribute to its high transmissibility. Highlights The in vivo transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by sgRNA profiling, for 25 patient samples around the globe. The Spike protein expression is an order of magnitude higher in SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, possibly contributing to the virus\u2019 elevated transmissibility.

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme \u0022lockdown\u0022-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths. Findings We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where \u0022lockdown\u0022-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability.

By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans\u0027 behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55%-86% of counties and for 71%-91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre-epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID-19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back-to-work planning for the United States.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fenichel, Eli P; Berry, Kevin; Bayham, Jude; Gonsalves, Gregg","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073098v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["larger counties","epidemic patterns","cases","pre-epidemic behavior","time use","distancing behavior","human behavior","smartphone location data","county demographics","epidemic history","Spatial patterns","United States","virus","home","modeling assumptions","driven proportional mixing SEIR model","promising sources of data","cumulative COVID","person contact","large epidemics","people of different health statuses","greatest share of case reduction relative","prioritizing testing resources","rapid rise","Americans\u0027 behavioral shifts","SAR-COV","work planning","infectious individual","probability","regular schedules","curve","Transmission","acquired immunity","population"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Data were from a baseline online survey of an inception cohort recruited in the weeks following the introduction of physical distancing and movement restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. These restrictions resulted in widespread unemployment and working hour reduction. Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 scale. Data on nature of work loss, social interactions, demographic, job and occupational characteristics were also collected. Regression modelling was conducted to determine the relationship between work loss, social interactions and psychological distress, accounting for confounders. Results: Among the 551 study participants 31% reported severe psychological distress, 35% in those with job loss and 28% in those still employed but working less. Those who had significantly greater odds of high psychological distress were younger, female, had lost their job and had lower social interactions. The relationship between job loss and distress became non-significant when financial stress, and occupation were included in the regression model, but the protective effect of higher social interactions remained significant. Discussion: There was a high prevalence of psychological distress in people losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, gender, job loss and social interactions were strongly associated with distress. Interventions that promote social interaction may help to reduce distress during among people losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collie, A.; Sheehan, L.; van Vreden, C.; Grant, G.; Whiteford, P.; Petrie, D.; Sim, M.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3.

The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Musarrat, Farhana; Chouljenko, Vladimir; Nabi, Rafiq; Dahal, Achyut; Jois, Seetharama D.; Kousoulas, Konstantin G.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dae808f9f267204fec9c67d4b72a2b53a548c47.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.060376","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MERS CoV","SARS S","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS S","S-o cell fusion","S-n expression","inhibited S-n","differential S-n","mediated cell fusion","extensive cell fusion","SARS-CoV","S trimer structure","S proteolytic processing","Complete inhibition of cell fusion","expression of SARS CoV","mediated membrane fusion","current SARS coronavirus","transfected Vero cell surfaces","glycoprotein","MERS CoV","nelfinavir mesylate acts","potential of nelfinavir mesylate","susceptible cells","viral envelope","Previous results","Coronaviruses","large multinucleated cells","plasma membrane","published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation","major determinant of virus infectivity","transient transfection of African green monkey kidney","cellular processes","FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor","Viracept","lung tissues of COVID","endocytosis","silico docking experiments","S2 amino terminus","positive-single stranded RNA viruses","comparison","antiviral drug","endosomal membranes","group of enveloped","agreement","early times","ability","severe respiratory distress","animals","humans","Computational modeling","immunogenicity","possibility","extracellular spaces","drugs","investigations","dose-dependent manner","Spike","neutralizing antibodies","systematic screening","patients","hours","pandemic","infections","endosomes","symptoms","micromolar concentration","deaths"],"language":"en"},

In January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Interest (PHEI). Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rocha Filho, Tarcisio M; Ganem dos Santos, Fabiana S.; Gomes, Victor B; Rocha, Thiago A.H.; Croda, Julio H.R.; Ramalho, Walter M; Araujo, Wildo N","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c895e827f2660b093f62221001694f207a29501.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20035873","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Public Health Emergency of International Interest","PHEI"],"locations":["Sao Paulo","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of COVID","deaths","study","number of cases","World Health Organization","city of Sao Paulo","outbreak of pneumonia","metropolitan region of Sao Paulo","metropolitan area of Sao Paulo","total cases","public health emergence","epidemic","SEIHR model","Public Health Emergency of International","results","Brazil","impact","older people","years","IQR","days","hospitalizations","major metropolitan center","expected time evolution","city of Wuhan","number of patients","reported parameters","parameter estimation errors","sampling parameter values","age-stratified structure","different age-groups","additional Hospitalized variables","Monte Carlo analysis","uniform distribution","constant transmission probability Pc","simulations","undetermined origin","respect","onset","management","primary healthcare services","south hemisphere","support","literature","hospitals","generalized SEIR","detection capacity","special planning","prognosis","burden","Susceptibles","confidence interval","pandemic","sensibility","tropical zones","PHEI","China","critic case","policymakers","Methods","authorities","Limitations","Conclusion","Hubei","Objectives","aim","order"],"language":"en"},

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Swarkar; Singh, Inderpal; Haider, Shazia; Malik, Md.

The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: The SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta ({beta}), gamma ({gamma}) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained. Results: The SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases. In the absence of MCO, the model predicts the peak of infection on 1 May 2020, less than 100 active cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero daily new case by 6 October 2020, with a total of 1.6 million infected cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that the present MCO has significantly reduced the number of susceptible population and the total number of infected cases.

Expression of candidate genes, which play a role in antiviral responses, was quantified. To confirm the antiviral responses of stimulated TOC, chicken macrophages were treated with supernatants from stimulated TOC, prior to infection with AIV.

The LQTS was found to be highly correlated to the contents of the marker compounds, indicating that quantitative analysis of the marker compounds may be substituted with the LQPM based on the chromatographic fingerprints for the purpose of quantifying all chemicals of a complex sample system.

During chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection however, excessive production of MCP-1 has been linked to disease pathogenesis. High MCP-1 serum levels are detected during the viremic phase of CHIKV infection and correlate with the virus titre. In vitro CHIKV infection was also shown to stimulate MCP-1 production in whole blood; yet the role and the mechanism of MCP-1 production upon infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells remain unknown. Here we found that active CHIKV infection stimulated production of MCP-1 in monocytes. Importantly however, we found that communication with other leukocytes is crucial to yield MCP-1 by monocytes upon CHIKV infection. Indeed, blocking interferon-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor or the JAK1/JAK2 signalling downstream of the receptor abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production. Additionally, we show that despite the apparent correlation between IFN type I, CHIKV replication and MCP-1, modulating the levels of the chemokine did not influence CHIKV infection. In summary, our data disclose the complexity of MCP-1 regulation upon CHIKV infection and point to a crucial role of IFN\u03B2 in the chemokine secretion.

Influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Fortunately, vaccination can mitigate the negative effects of this common infectious disease. Although inoculating frontline health care workers (HCWs) helps minimize disease transmission, some HCWs continue to resist participating in voluntary immunization programs. A potential solution to this problem is government-mandated vaccination for HCWs; however, in practice, there are substantial barriers to the adoption of such policies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process. METHODS: Documents from secondary data sources were analysed using Kingdon\u2019s agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. RESULTS: The problems, politics, and policies streams of Kingdon\u2019s framework have converged and diverged repeatedly over an extended period (policy windows have opened and closed several times). In each instance, a technically feasible solution was available. However, despite the evidence supporting the value of HCW immunization, alignment of the three agenda setting streams occurred for very short periods of time, during which, opposition lobby groups reacted, making the proposed solution less politically acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the adoption of any new policies, issues must reach a government\u2019s decision agenda. Based on Kingdon\u2019s agenda setting framework, this only occurs when there is alignment of the problems, politics, and policies streams. Understanding this process makes it easier to predict the likelihood of a policy being adopted, and ultimately implemented. Such learning may be applied to policy issues in other jurisdictions. In the case of mandatory influenza vaccinations for HCWs in Ontario, it seems highly unlikely that a new policy will be adopted until perception of the problem\u2019s importance is sufficient to overcome the political opposition to implementing a solution and thus, create a window of opportunity that is open long enough to support change.","publish_time":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson-Lee, Angela; Barr, Neil G.; Randall, Glen E.","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f52a42602489ad329c93edf69e213267303c1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5041441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Kingdon\u2019s agenda","policy windows","policy issues","new policy","policies streams of Kingdon\u2019s framework","mandatory immunization of HCWs","possible policy adoption","new policies","converging streams","proposed solution","feasible solution","potential solution","government\u2019s decision agenda","Ontario","windows of opportunity","politics","problems","alignment","likelihood","process","case of mandatory influenza vaccinations","value of HCW immunization","voluntary immunization programs","consequences of annual influenza outbreaks","serious public health threat","substantial barriers","disease transmission","window of opportunity","political opposition","general public","historical review of barriers","common infectious disease","government-mandated vaccination","opposition lobby groups","frontline health care workers","secondary data sources","negative effects","world","perception","METHODS","Documents","short periods of time","problem\u2019s importance","BACKGROUND","evidence","practice","extended period","paper","instance","RESULTS","learning","jurisdictions","vulnerable populations","purpose","change","times","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Here we report that while PIV2, PIV5, and mumps virus (MuV) are sensitive to IFIT1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as PIV3, Sendai virus (SeV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are resistant. The IFIT1 sensitivity of PIV5 was not rescued by coinfection with an IFIT1-resistant virus (PIV3), demonstrating that PIV3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1 and that the inhibition of PIV5 mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting elements. We developed an in vitro translation system using purified human IFIT1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1. While the translations of PIV2, PIV5, and MuV mRNAs were directly inhibited by IFIT1, the translations of PIV3, SeV, and CDV mRNAs were not. Using purified human mRNA-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by IFIT1 is dependent upon a 5\u2032 guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be N7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2\u2032O methylation of the cap 1 ribose. Intriguingly, PIV5 M mRNA, in contrast to NP mRNA, remained sensitive to inhibition by IFIT1 following in vitro 2\u2032O methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mRNAs may influence their sensitivity to IFIT1. Thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by IFIT1. Possible biological consequences of this are discussed. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, and yet most of their genes encode structural proteins and proteins involved in their replication cycle. Thus, the amount of genetic information that determines the type of disease that paramyxoviruses cause is relatively small. One factor that will influence disease outcomes is how they interact with innate host cell defenses, including the interferon (IFN) system. Here we show that different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. Strikingly, all the rubulaviruses tested were sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG56/IFIT1, while all the other paramyxoviruses tested were resistant. We developed novel in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1, demonstrating that the mRNAs of rubulaviruses can be directly inhibited by IFIT1 and that this is at least partially because their mRNAs are not correctly methylated.","publish_time":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, D.

A protein-binding nucleophile reacts reversibly with a bis-electrophilic warhead, thereby positioning the second electrophile in close proximity of the active site of a viral protease, resulting in the covalent de-activation of the enzyme. The concept is implemented for Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease, a pharmacological target against enteroviral infections. Using an aldehyde-epoxide as bis-electrophile, active fragment combinations are validated through measuring the protein inactivation rate and by detecting covalent protein modification in mass spectrometry.

Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2\u201394.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3\u2032LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180.

This study attempts to confirm these effects on the transplanted cervical cancer (U27) mouse model in vivo. METHODS: Forty eight Kunming mice were randomly divided in to six groups: normal control group (Control group), U27 tumor model group (Model group), cyclophosphamide administration group (CTX group),low-dose ASMq group (ASMq.L group), medium-dose ASMq group (ASMq.M group), and high-dose ASMq group (ASMq.H group). The five groups except normal control group transplanted with cervical cancer (U27) cells. We observed mice tumor inhibition rate and conducted the histopathological analysisUsing the western blot assay, the expression of TGF-\u03B21 and TNF-\u03B1 protein in transplanted cervical cancer U27 tumor tissue were detected. RESULTS: The tumor inhibition rates of CTX group, ASMq.L group, ASMq.M group, and ASMq.H group were 72.21, 31.27, 60.53 and 51.94% respectively, has obvious antitumor effect. ASMq significantly promote the spleen tlymphocyte proliferation of transplanted cervical cancer U27 mice. Invasive growth and diffusion rate in tumor tissue were accelerate in the transplanted cervical cancer U27 model group. Tumor tissue necrosis of tumor cells are smaller in the medium, high dosage group. Compared with the U27 model group, the expression levels of TGF-\u03B21 protein and TNF-\u03B1 protein expression exhibited statistically significant decreased in the mice tumor tissues in the CTX administration group and the ASMq administration group. CONCLUSIONS: ASMq has some antitumor effects on U27 model mice in vivo, The effects are achieved not only by improving the immune function of U27 model mice, but also by inhibiting the expression levels of TGF-\u03B21 protein while promoting the expression levels of TNF-\u03B1 protein.","publish_time":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omarniyaz, Zuhragul; Yu, Yang; Yang, Tao; Shan, Lianlian; Miao, Weiwei; Reyimu, Renaguli; Upur, Halmurat; Aikemu, Ainiwaer","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6d7e94615aea8a7a591d68cea8c6710ce86df13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5122163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5122163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASMq administration group","H group","U27 tumor model group","medium-dose ASMq group","high-dose ASMq group","low-dose ASMq group","CTX administration group","transplanted cervical cancer U27 model group","normal control group","cyclophosphamide administration group","high dosage group","tumor inhibition rates of CTX group","transplanted cervical cancer U27 tumor tissue","total flavonoids of ASMq","mice tumor tissues","immune function of U27 model mice","mice tumor inhibition rate","Tumor tissue necrosis of tumor cells","spleen tlymphocyte proliferation of transplanted cervical cancer U27 mice","\u03B21 protein","TNF-\u03B1 protein expression","expression of TGF","mouse model","expression levels of TNF","expression levels of TGF","Kunming mice","antitumor effects","groups","antioxidant ability of human cervix cancer HeLa cell","diffusion rate","obvious antitumor effect","histopathological analysisUsing","western blot assay","traditional uyghur medicine","Invasive growth","Abnormal Savda Munziq","anti-tumour properties","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","study"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to examine the status of having a USC and its patient-related sociodemographic factors among Korean adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2012 Korea Health Panel survey. Panel participants were selected for the study who were aged 18 years or older and who replied to questionnaire items on having a USC (n = 11,935). RESULTS: Of the participants, 21.5% had a usual place and 13.9% had a usual physician. Reasons for not having a USC were seldom being ill (66.1%), the preference to visit multiple medical institutions (27.9%), and others. The private community clinic was the most common type of usual place (57.0%). In patient-reported attributes of care provided by a usual physician, the percentages of positive responses for comprehensiveness and coordination were 67.2% and 34.5%, respectively. By institution type, primary care clinics showed the lowest percentage (32.8%) of positive responses for coordination. Adjusted odds ratios of having a usual physician were 3.77 (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.75\u20133.79) for those aged 65 years or older (vs. aged 18\u201334 years), 1.31 (CI: 1.30\u20131.31) for females (vs. males), 0.72 (CI: 0.72\u20130.73) for unmarried people (vs. married), 1.16 (CI: 1.16\u20131.16) for college graduates or higher (vs. elementary school graduate or less), 0.64 for the fifth quintile (vs. the first quintile) by household income, 1.53 (CI: 1.52\u20131.54) for Medical Aid (vs. employee health insurance) for type of health insurance, and 4.09 (CI: 4.08\u20134.10) for presence (vs. absence) of a chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Korean adults who have a USC is extremely low, the most influential factor of having a USC is having a chronic disease or not, and Korean patients experience much poorer health care coordination than do patients in other industrialized countries. The findings of this study will give insight to researchers and policy makers regarding the potential facilitators of and barriers to promoting having a USC in the general Korean public.","publish_time":"2016-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Ah Reum; Kim, Kyoungwoo; Lee, Jae-Ho; Sung, Nak-Jin; Lee, Sang-il; Hyun, Min Kyung","journal":"BMC Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e5392ae9728ae529623e00c6d2e411a931fffc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5129206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["USC","usual physician","Usual source of care","poorer health care coordination","Korean patients","type of health insurance","attributes of care","common type of usual place","years","primary care clinics","hallmarks of primary care","employee health insurance","proportion of Korean adults","institution type","general Korean public","Korea Health Panel survey","study","Panel participants","quintile","percentages of positive responses","Medical Aid","chronic diseases","multiple medical institutions","patient-related sociodemographic factors","policy makers","insight","researchers","potential facilitators","lowest percentage","elementary school graduate","comprehensiveness","private community clinic","Adjusted odds ratios","college graduates","questionnaire items","absence","preference","influential factor","barriers","CONCLUSIONS","household income","BACKGROUND","industrialized countries","confidence interval","unmarried people","Data","findings","METHODS","females","presence","RESULTS","status","Reasons"],"language":"en"},

However, the effect of IFN-\u03B1 on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-\u03B1 on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-\u03B1 markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-\u03B1 treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-\u03B1 treatment. In addition, caspase 4\u2014which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis\u2014was activated in response to IFN-\u03B1 treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-\u03B1-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-\u03B1 treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-\u03B1 might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-\u03B1 may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.","publish_time":"2016-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Wei-Ye; Cao, Cheng; Liu, Li","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cefbe0e7441f96ec3d0a08e9d7f291dbcf44f4e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5133833.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 treatment","treatment of IFN","interferon \u03B1","effect of IFN","mediated cell apoptosis","stress-induced apoptosis","apoptosis of HeLa cells","renal cell cancer","apoptosis of thesetumor cell types","treatment of various malignancies","intrinsic apoptotic pathway","activation of caspase","related ER stress-induced pathway","intrinsic mitochondrial pathway","extrinsic apoptotic pathway","anti-cervical cancer capacity","regulation of Bcl","malignant melanoma","hepatocellular carcinoma","ADP-ribose","cleaved poly","response","testing model","polymerase","Bim","small interfering RNA","siRNA","proliferation","sensitizing agent","endoplasmic reticulum","release of cytochrome c","significant changes","expressions of caspases","PARP","xL","study","results","findings","addition"],"language":"en"},

Circulation of this virus has continued each year shifting to typical winter months. We compared the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics for the first three waves of virus circulation. METHODS: The first wave was defined as reported cases with onset dates between March 31-September 30, 2013, the second wave was defined as October 1, 2013-September 30, 2014 and the third wave was defined as October 1, 2014-September 30, 2015. We used simple descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of the three distinct waves of virus circulation. RESULTS: In mainland China, 134 cases, 306 cases and 219 cases were detected and reported in first three waves, respectively. The median age of cases was statistically significantly older in the first wave (61 years vs. 56 years, 56 years, p \u003C 0.001) compared to the following two waves. Most reported cases were among men in all three waves. There was no statistically significant difference between case fatality proportions (33, 42 and 45%, respectively, p = 0.08). There were no significant statistical differences for time from illness onset to first seeking healthcare, hospitalization, lab confirmation, initiation antiviral treatment and death between the three waves. A similar percentage of cases in all waves reported exposure to poultry or live poultry markets (87%, 88%, 90%, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of severe disease between the each of the first three waves of virus circulation. Twenty-one clusters were reported during these three waves (4, 11 and 6 clusters, respectively), of which, 14 were considered to be possible human-to-human transmission. CONCLUSION: Though our case investigation for the first three waves found few differences between the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, there is continued international concern about the pandemic potential of this virus. Since the virus continues to circulate, causes more severe disease, has the ability to mutate and become transmissible from human-to-human, and there is limited natural protection from infection in communities, it is critical that surveillance systems in China and elsewhere are alert to the influenza H7N9 virus.","publish_time":"2016-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Nijuan; Iuliano, A.

Over time, and aided by further introductions from nonswine hosts, swine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of swine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria applied to a data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences led to 28 distinct clades as the basis for the nomenclature. We developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined data set of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyses indicated that 87% of the swine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present had HAs that belonged to 7 contemporary cocirculating clades. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provide an accurate method for researchers, diagnosticians, and health officials to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be updated readily to track evolving nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons of IAVs infecting humans and pigs, within and between regions, and can provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on vaccine strain selection, diagnostic reagents, and test performance, thereby simplifying communication of such data. IMPORTANCE A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.","publish_time":"2016-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Tavis K.; Macken, Catherine A.; Lewis, Nicola S.; Scheuermann, Richard H.; Van Reeth, Kristien; Brown, Ian H.; Swenson, Sabrina L.; Simon, Ga\u00EBlle; Saito, Takehiko; Berhane, Yohannes; Ciacci-Zanella, Janice; Pereda, Ariel; Davis, C.

An RNA pseudoknot structure located in the overlapping region of the gag and pro genes of Simian Retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) stimulates frameshifting. However, the experimental characterization of SRV-1 pseudoknot (un)folding dynamics and the effect of the base triple formation is lacking. Here, we report the results of our single-molecule nanomanipulation using optical tweezers and theoretical simulation by steered molecular dynamics. Our results directly reveal that the energetic coupling between loop 2 and stem 1 via minor-groove base triple formation enhances the mechanical stability. The terminal base pair in stem 1 (directly in contact with a translating ribosome at the slippery site) also affects the mechanical stability of the pseudoknot. The \u22121 frameshifting efficiency is positively correlated with the cooperative one-step unfolding force and inversely correlated with the one-step mechanical unfolding rate at zero force. A significantly improved correlation was observed between \u22121 frameshifting efficiency and unfolding rate at forces of 15\u201335 pN, consistent with the fact that the ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity.

Our sensing platform relies on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets conjugated with antibodies to provide quantitative binding sites for analyte proteins. When analyte proteins and standard fluorescein-labelled proteins are competing for the binding sites, the assay exhibits quantitative fluorescence quenching by GO for the fluorescein-labelled proteins as determined by the analyte protein concentration. Because of this mechanism, measured fluorescence intensity from unquenched fluorescein-labelled protein was shown to increase with an increasing analyte protein concentration. As an alternative to the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), our method does not require an enzyme-linked second antibody for protein recognition and the enzyme for optical signal measurement. Thus, it is beneficial with its low cost and fewer systematic errors caused by the series of antigen-antibody recognition steps in ELISA. Immune globulin G (IgG) was introduced as a model protein to test our method and our results showed that the limit of detection for IgG was 4.67 pmol mL(\u22121) in the buffer solution.

However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.","publish_time":"2017-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giardina, Federica; Romero-Severson, Ethan Obie; Albert, Jan; Britton, Tom; Leitner, Thomas","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/472602b70bca7504518686f34f5b1b15dbe21725.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9e7bb369224888a04493301fe9b7e1d4e31531c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5279806.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5279806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host transmission tree","host transmission patterns","underlying epidemic contact network","epidemic level","host evolutionary dynamics","host evolutionary process","different types of contact networks","virus phylogeny","transmission history","transmission histories","host evolutionary model","ABC inference","distance-based tree statistics","different outbreaks","resulting phylogeny","infectivity dynamics","epidemiological simulations","network parameters","virus time-scaled phylogeny","topological differences","inference method","Phylogenetic inference","ABC framework","discriminatory power","diversification process","well-studied network models","key epidemiological quantities","patient-specific differences","comparison","attractive means","disease stages","approximate Bayesian computation","genealogy","incomplete sampling","perfect correspondence","Swedish HIV","infection rate","interpretation","node height","epidemics","important implications","trees","possibility","realism","interactions"],"language":"en"},

Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility. Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay. Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain. Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity.","publish_time":"2017-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nie, Jianhui; Wu, Xiaohong; Ma, Jian; Cao, Shouchun; Huang, Weijin; Liu, Qiang; Li, Xuguang; Li, Yuhua; Wang, Youchun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/644979755526ea0ca2ce4990c87f0dd9342aaf89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5316940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5316940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live-virus","rabies pseudovirus","pseudovirus-based neutralization assay","traditional assays","neutralization assays","live virus model","effective pseudovirus production system","development of novel PBNA assays","efficient pseudovirus production system capable","safety","high-titer pseudoviruses","traditional method","low titer","better reproducibility","evaluation of rabies vaccine","high throughput capacity","RFFIT","current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test","rapidity","times","versatility","useful virological tools","experimental time","spleen","mice","dynamic viral distributions","great agreement","weeks","data","liver","brain","wider applications","intravenous administration","days"],"language":"en"},

Here, we studied the role of IL-6 in acute influenza infection in mice. IL-6-deficient mice infected with influenza virus exhibited higher lethality, lost more body weight and had higher fibroblast accumulation and lower extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover in the lung than their wild-type counterparts. Deficiency in IL-6 enhanced proliferation, migration and survival of lung fibroblasts, as well as increased virus-induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. IL-6-deficient lung fibroblasts produced elevated levels of TGF-\u03B2, which may contribute to their survival. Furthermore, macrophage recruitment to the lung and phagocytic activities of macrophages during influenza infection were reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that IL-6 is crucial for lung repair after influenza-induced lung injury through reducing fibroblast accumulation, promoting epithelial cell survival, increasing macrophage recruitment to the lung and enhancing phagocytosis of viruses by macrophages.

In this study, we investigated this issue in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate that LPA induces apoptosis in HeLa cells at pathologic concentrations with a concomitant upregulation of the expression of TNFRSF21 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21), also known as death receptor number 6 (DR6) involved in inflammation. Moreover, treatment of cells with LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonist abolished the DR6 upregulation by LPA. LPA-induced DR6 expression was also abrogated by pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of GPCRs, and by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, MEK, and ERK. Intriguingly, LPA-induced DR6 expression was specifically blocked by dominant-negative form of PKC\u03B4 (PKC\u03B4-DN). LPA-induced DR6 expression was also dramatically inhibited by knockdown of ERK or CREB. These results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the transcription factor CREB mediate LPA-induced DR6 expression. More interestingly, knockdown of DR6 using siRNA approach remarkably attenuated LPA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells is mediated by the upregulation of DR6 expression.","publish_time":"2017-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Yunzhou; Wu, Yong; Cui, Mei-Zhen; Xu, Xuemin","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/670f2388055a866aa6706a2c1130d68c2f37d15d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5350427.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350427/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LPA","HeLa","ERK","CREB","MEK/ERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPA-induced DR6 expression","LPA receptor","attenuated LPA-induced apoptosis","upregulation of DR6 expression","DR6 upregulation","knockdown of DR6","apoptotic effect of LPA","LPA-regulated cell growth","expression of TNFRSF21","HeLa cells","treatment of cells","knockdown of ERK","cell survival","concomitant upregulation","MEK","ERK pathway","results","transcription factor CREB","death receptor number","tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member","inhibitor of GPCRs","PKC\u03B4-DN","dominant-negative form of PKC\u03B4","siRNA approach","mechanisms","pathologic concentrations","LPAR","antagonist","regulation of diverse cellular events","G protein","pathways","inhibitors of PI3K","PTX","activation","pertussis toxin","bioactive phospholipid","receptors","issue","extensive studies","Lysophosphatidic acid","conclusion","data","study","inflammation"],"language":"en"},

In addition to its well-known role of binding iron, lactoferrin carries many important biological functions, including the promotion of cell proliferation and differentiation, and as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic protein. These functions differ among lactoferrin homologs in mammals. Although considerable attention has been given to the many functions of lactoferrin, its primary nutritional contribution is presumed to be related to its iron-binding characteristics, whereas the role of glycosylation has been neglected. Given the critical role of glycan binding in many biological processes, the glycan moieties in lactoferrin are likely to contribute significantly to the biological roles of lactoferrin. Despite the high amino acid sequence homology in different lactoferrins (up to 99%), each exhibits a unique glycosylation pattern that may be responsible for heterogeneity of the biological properties of lactoferrins. An important task for the production of biotherapeutics and medical foods containing bioactive glycoproteins is the assessment of the contributions of individual glycans to the observed bioactivities.

Host genetic variability is an important determinant of the risk of developing TB in humans. Although the association between MBL polymorphisms and TB has been studied in various populations, the results are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a Lur population of Iran. METHODS: In this case-control study, four functional MBL gene polymorphisms (HL, XY, PQ and AB) were genotyped by using PCR Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) technique in a Lur population living in Lorestan Province, consisting of 100 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) age and sex matched 100 healthy controls (HCs). Association analyses were performed with the SPSS 21 statistical software. RESULTS: We found that MBL (HH) genotype polymorphism significantly was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (35% in patients vs. 22% in controls, P = 0.0417, OR = 1.909, %95 CI = 1.020\u20133.573). Additionally, H allele showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (56.5% in patients vs. 46% in controls, P = 0.0357, OR = 1.525, %95 CI = 1.028\u20132.262). Also, the distribution of L allele in patients was significantly lower frequency in TB patients compared to controls (43.5% vs. 54%, P = 0.0357, OR = 0.656, %95 CI = 0.442\u20130.973). However, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of AB, XY and PQ polymorphisms were not significantly different between the patients and the controls. We couldn\u0027t detect any significant differences between haplotypes among TB patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that HH genotype and H allele may increase the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in the Lur population of Iran, although L allele may decrease the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in this population. We suggest that it is necessary to further more studies with larger sample size and other ethnic population.","publish_time":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amiri, Ali; Sabooteh, Toomaj; Shahsavar, Farhad; Anbari, Khatereh; Pouremadi, Flora","journal":"Genom Data","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f79e36092b45aef0e928b577166a4c44198f2825.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5432655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5432655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL","PQ","AB","HH"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["TB patients","pulmonary TB","increased risk of TB","MBL polymorphisms","risk of developing TB","pulmonary tuberculosis","healthy controls","Lur population of Iran","PQ polymorphisms","increased susceptibility","H allele","ethnic population","functional MBL gene polymorphisms","significant association","XY","PTB","genotype polymorphism","HH genotype","infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Association analyses","results","significant differences","case-control study","genotypic frequencies of AB","PCR Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism","SSCP","important determinant","technique","sex","age","haplotypes","larger sample size","lower frequency","mannose-binding lectin","studies","Host genetic variability","SPSS","findings","various populations","Lorestan Province","HCs","humans","statistical software","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","distribution","OBJECTIVE","aim"],"language":"en"},

We found that the introduction of PB2 mutation with K at 627 but not K at 591 or N at 701 to the duck H7N9 virus led to increased pathogenicity in mice. We also found that the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03B1, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1\u03B1 were associated with increased severity of infection. We conclude that introduction of the mammalian adaptation mutations into the PB2 gene of duck H7N9 viruses, which are genetically unrelated to the zoonotic H7N9 lineage, can also enhance pathogenicity in mice.","publish_time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Weixuan; Lee, Horace Hok Yeung; Li, Run Feng; Zhu, Huachen Maria; Yi, Guan; Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik; Yang, Zi Feng; Mok, Chris Ka Pun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b83f9595c9669da923281321541bba417ae5f848.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5443809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["zoonotic H7N9 lineage","cluster of H7N9 viruses","PB2 gene of duck H7N9 viruses","duck viruses","human H7N9 isolates","recognition of zoonotic disease","increased pathogenicity","China","introduction of PB2 mutation","mice","TNF-\u03B1","avian species","increased severity of infection","novel avian-origin influenza","genetic background distinct","mammalian adaptation mutations","residues","induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines","persons","ducks","polymerase basic protein","Amino acid changes","MCP","overall mortality","MIP"],"language":"en"},

The chicken IFITM (chIFITM) genes are clustered on chromosome 5 and to date four genes have been annotated, namely chIFITM1, chIFITM3, chIFITM5 and chIFITM10. However, due to poor assembly of this locus in the Gallus Gallus v4 genome, accurate characterization has so far proven problematic. Recently, a new chicken reference genome assembly Gallus Gallus v5 was generated using Sanger, 454, Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies identifying considerable differences in the chIFITM locus over the previous genome releases. METHODS: We re-sequenced the locus using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies and we mapped RNA-seq data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) to this finalized chIFITM locus. Using SureSelect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chIFITM locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a White Leghorn, and a turkey. RESULTS: We confirmed the Gallus Gallus v5 consensus except for two insertions of 5 and 1 base pair within the chIFITM3 and B4GALNT4 genes, respectively, and a single base pair deletion within the B4GALNT4 gene. The pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of A63V in the CIL domain of IFITM2 compared to Red Jungle fowl and 13, 13 and 11 differences between IFITM1, 2 and 3 of chickens and turkeys, respectively. RNA-seq shows chIFITM2 and chIFITM3 expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chIFITM1 is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Locus resequencing using these capture probes and RNA-seq based expression analysis will allow the further characterization of genetic diversity within Galliformes.

In this study we describe the faecal virome of healthy dogs and dogs with acute diarrhoea in Australia, using a shotgun metagenomic approach. Viral sequences from a range of different virus families, including both RNA and DNA families, and known pathogens implicated in enteric disease were documented. Twelve viral families were identified, of which four were bacteriophages. Eight eukaryotic viral families were detected: Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, Adenoviridae and Papillomaviridae. Families Astroviridae, Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae were found only in dogs with acute diarrhoea, with Astroviridae being the most common family identified in this group. Due to its prevalence, characterisation the complete genome of a canine astrovirus was performed. These studies indicate that metagenomic analyses are useful for the investigation of viral populations in the faeces of dogs.

In 2015 the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) started to collaborate with a private hospital network to develop a SARI surveillance system using case-based data on ICD-10 codes. This first-time description of the system shows its application to the analysis of five influenza seasons. METHODS: Since week 40/2015, weekly updated anonymized data on discharged patients overall and on patients with respiratory illness including ICD-10 codes of primary and secondary diagnoses are transferred from the network data center to RKI. Retrospective datasets were also provided. Our descriptive analysis is based on data of 47 sentinel hospitals collected between weeks 1/2012 to 20/2016. We applied three different SARI case definitions (CD) based on ICD-10 codes for discharge diagnoses of respiratory tract infections (J09 - J22): basic CD (BCD), using only primary diagnoses; sensitive CD (SCD), using primary and secondary diagnoses; timely CD (TCD), using only primary diagnoses of patients hospitalized up to one week. We compared the CD with regard to severity, age distribution and timeliness and with results from the national primary care sentinel system. RESULTS: The 47 sentinel hospitals covered 3.6% of patients discharged from all German hospitals in 2013. The SCD comprised 2.2 times patients as the BCD, and 3.6 times as many as the TCD. Time course of SARI cases corresponded well to results from primary care surveillance and influenza virus circulation. The patients fulfilling the TCD had been completely reported after 3 weeks, which was fastest among the CD. The proportion of SARI cases among patients was highest in the youngest age group of below 5-year-olds. However, the age group 60 years and above contributed most SARI cases. This was irrespective of the CD used. CONCLUSIONS: In general, available data and the implemented reporting system are appropriate to provide timely and reliable information on SARI in inpatients in Germany. Our ICD-10-based approach proved to be useful for fulfilling requirements for SARI surveillance. The exploratory approach gave valuable insights in data structure and emphasized the advantages of different CD.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buda, S.; Tolksdorf, K.; Schuler, E.; Kuhlen, R.; Haas, W.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3083f7cc3a62acaf4a94a4da4eceb84081d70329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5493063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Robert Koch Institute","SARI","SCD","TCD"],"locations":["ICD-10","Germany"],"keyphrases":["primary diagnoses of patients","SARI surveillance system","timely CD","codes of primary","discharged patients","times patients","basic CD","sensitive CD","primary care surveillance","case-based data","proportion of SARI cases","ICD","advantages of different CD","available data","data structure","secondary diagnoses","different SARI case definitions","Time course of SARI cases","national primary care sentinel system","network data center","sentinel hospitals","results","based approach","TCD","discharge diagnoses of respiratory tract infections","weekly updated anonymized data","Syndromic surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections","respiratory illness","implemented reporting system","age distribution","BCD","youngest age group","SCD","RKI","influenza seasons","German hospitals","weeks","influenza virus circulation","exploratory approach","descriptive analysis","private hospital network","J09 - J22","reliable information","timeliness","valuable insights","severity","BACKGROUND","inpatients","regard","application","years","Robert Koch Institute","seriousness of disease","CONCLUSIONS","Germany","requirements","first-time description","METHODS","year-olds","Retrospective datasets"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: The objective of this systematic review is to examine the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors on dengue transmission in Puerto Rico and to draw lessons for Zika response. RESULTS: A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journal articles was performed, producing 562 articles; 26 were selected for this review. Findings indicate that human activities and behaviors (urbanization, migration, and consumption) as well as climate have a significant impact on the abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti, the vector for dengue, Zika, and other viruses. CONCLUSION: Despite the public health burden of dengue limited investments have been made in research and surveillance. Future research is needed to develop models that integrate the multivariate effects of climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors, which for Puerto Rico have mostly been examined independently.

Mutant MDA5 was expressed but did not recognize the synthetic MDA5 agonist/(ds)RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. When overexpressed, mutant MDA5 failed to drive luciferase activity from the IFNB1 promoter or promoters containing ISRE or NF-\u03BAB sequence motifs. In respiratory epithelial cells or fibroblasts, wild-type but not knockdown of MDA5 restricted HRV infection while increasing IFN-stimulated gene expression and IFN-\u03B2/\u03BB.

H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung. This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia. The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine. Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures. The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract.

Viral cell tropism is a key determinant of viral pathogenesis, but the tropism of RV is currently poorly understood. We analyzed various human cell lines and determined that RV only establishes an infection efficiently in particular non-immune cell lines. To establish an infection the host cells must be susceptible and permissible. To assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines, we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). VSV-RV/CE2E1 entered cells in an RV envelope protein-dependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an RV-specific antibody. The infection was Ca(2\u002B)-dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on RV envelope proteins for the VSV-RV/CE2E1 infection. Human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. However, susceptibility of immune cells to VSV-RV/CE2E1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells. Our data therefore suggest that immune cells are generally less susceptible to RV infection than non-immune cells, but the susceptibility of immune cells is enhanced upon stimulation.","publish_time":"2017-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakata, Masafumi; Tani, Hideki; Anraku, Masaki; Kataoka, Michiyo; Nagata, Noriyo; Seki, Fumio; Tahara, Maino; Otsuki, Noriyuki; Okamoto, Kiyoko; Takeda, Makoto; Mori, Yoshio","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5599607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5599607/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV infection","VSV-RV","tropism of RV","non-immune cells","RV envelope proteins","susceptibility of immune cells","CE2E1 infection","Human non-immune cell lines","particular non-immune cell lines","RV-specific antibody","susceptibility of individual cell lines","RV envelope protein-dependent manner","various human cell lines","host cells","systemic infection","Viral cell tropism","stimulation","Rubella virus","pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus","key determinant of viral pathogenesis","dependency","endosomal acidification inhibitors","humans","data"],"language":"en"},

Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (q(f,o)) and the q(f) ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6\u2013594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (\u0394p) through the mask are used to determine q(f) and q(f,o). Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The \u0394p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H(2)O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the \u0394p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the q(f) values of all of the masks: q(f) fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the \u0394p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the \u0394p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the \u0394p of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the q(f,o) values for the three electret masks. The value of q(f,o) for PM(0.1) exceeded that for PM(0.1\u20130.6), because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better q(f) for a given pressure drop. The values of q(f,o), particularly for PM(0.1), reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.","publish_time":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Tzu-Hsien; Chen, Chih-Chieh; Huang, Sheng-Hsiu; Kuo, Chung-Wen; Lai, Chane-Yu; Lin, Wen-Yinn","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c6e27a1a325b80e4b57ab890da40aca90737d7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5638397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5638397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["values of q","better q","value of q","\u0394p of N95","Spunlace masks","\u0394p values","nm","Gauze mask","pretreated N95 masks","penetration of particles","Chemical decontamination methods","physical decontamination methods","Spunlace nonwoven masks","effectiveness of decontamination methods","chemical methods","available electret masks","penetrating particles","lower penetration","PM","developed evaluation methods","particles smaller","pre-decontaminated N95","penetrating particle size","respective penetration rates","overall filter quality","concentration of polydispersed particles","scanning mobility particle sizer","given pressure","MPS","breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers","tested treatments","diameter","ethanol","reusing FFRs","rice cooker","effects","autoclave","respirators","sizes","Experimental results","study","use","Bleach","priority"],"language":"en"},

The LL-HA1/L/AcmA was orally administered into mice and the immune response was evaluated. Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA developed detectable specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid. The results obtained demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited mucosal immunity in both the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract. The protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in immunized mice against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed. Upon challenge, the non-immunized group of mice showed high susceptibility to influenza virus infection. In contrast, 7/8 of mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA survived. In conclusion, oral administration of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice induced mucosal immunity and most importantly, provided protection against lethal influenza virus challenge.

For most environmental pollutants, including perchloroethylene (PERC), experimental data are lacking, resulting in default assumptions being used to account for variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively examined the relationship between PERC toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level to test whether individuals with increased oxidative metabolism are be more sensitive to hepatotoxicity following PERC exposure. METHODS: Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) were orally administered a single dose of PERC ([Formula: see text]) or vehicle (Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points ([Formula: see text] /strain/time). Concentration\u2013time profiles were generated for PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate (TCA) in multiple tissues. Toxicodynamic phenotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined. Based on area under the curve (AUC), the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude ([Formula: see text]-fold). Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels. Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss, induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR [Formula: see text])-regulated genes, and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Clustering was observed among a) liver levels of PERC, TCA, and triglycerides; b) TCA levels in liver and kidney; and c) TCA levels in serum, brain, fat, and lung. CONCLUSIONS: Using the CC mouse population model, we have demonstrated a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP788","publish_time":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cichocki, Joseph A.; Furuya, Shinji; Venkatratnam, Abhishek; McDonald, Thomas J.; Knap, Anthony H.; Wade, Terry; Sweet, Stephen; Chiu, Weihsueh A.; Threadgill, David W.; Rusyn, Ivan","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31fae2807695521804442fedcd3f7b9f17d0f9ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5726344.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Toxicodynamic"],"organizations":["PERC","Collaborative Cross","TCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PERC toxicokinetics","toxicokinetics of PERC","TCA toxicokinetics","liver levels of PERC","effect of PERC","PERC exposure","range of liver TCA levels","Formula","text","single dose of PERC","toxicodynamics","population level","strains","Significant variability","time profiles","Toxicodynamic phenotyping","CC mouse population model","Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1","Evaluation of interindividual variability","various time points","variable relationship","increased oxidative metabolism","primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate","induction of peroxisome proliferator","bodyweight loss","kidney","challenging step","receptor-alpha","perchloroethylene","individuals","PPAR","brain","serum","triglycerides","regulated genes","dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis","order of magnitude","AUC","fat","hepatotoxicity","risk assessment","Male mice","Alkamuls-EL620","Collaborative Cross","multiple tissues","experimental data","curve","METHODS","BACKGROUND","vehicle","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","environmental pollutants","area","lung","default assumptions","Concentration","fold","OBJECTIVE","Clustering"],"language":"en"},

We discuss issues related to parameter identifiability, uncertainty quantification and propagation as well as model performance and forecasts along examples based on phenomenological and mechanistic models parameterized using simulated and real datasets.","publish_time":"2017-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70549fd773d28dfe6e47cbc51775b61c1816003f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5726591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mathematical models","observed data","mechanistic models","time series data","simple data assimilation framework","forecasts","ordinary differential equation models","temporal scales","quantitative framework","impact of interventions","impact of control strategies","temporal progression of case counts","estimates of key kinetic parameters","patterns","propagation","population growth","examples","potential underlying mechanisms","infectious disease transmission dynamics","parameter identifiability","uncertainty quantification","instance","hypotheses","model performance","frequentist approach","scientists","Bayesian estimation approaches","error structure","real datasets","contrast","question","issues","priors"],"language":"en"},

The use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome and more appropriate care and treatment. METHODS: We conducted a year-long exploratory study of fever syndrome among patients \u2265 1 year if age, presenting to clinical settings with an axillary temperature of \u226537.5\u00B0C and symptomatic onset of \u22645 days. Blood and naso-pharyngeal/oral-pharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected and analyzed, respectively, using AFI and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) for multi-pathogen detection of 57 potential causative agents. Furthermore, we examined numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness, and conducted demographic, clinical, and behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression to statistically establish associations with agent detection. RESULTS: From 15 September 2014\u201313 September 2015, 1007 febrile patients were enrolled, and 997 contributed an epidemiologic survey, including: 14% (n = 139) 1\u003C5yrs, 19% (n = 186) 5-14yrs, and 67% (n = 672) \u226515yrs. AFI TAC and respiratory TAC were performed on 842 whole blood specimens and 385 NP/OP specimens, respectively. Of the 57 agents surveyed, Plasmodium was the most common agent detected. AFI TAC detected nucleic acid for one or more of seven microbial agents in 49% of AFI blood samples, including: Plasmodium (47%), Leptospira (3%), Bartonella (1%), Salmonella enterica (1%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Rickettsia (1%), and West Nile virus (1%). Respiratory TAC detected nucleic acid for 24 different microbial agents, including 12 viruses and 12 bacteria. The most common agents detected among our surveyed population were: Haemophilus influenzae (67%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Human Rhinovirus (25%), influenza A (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterovirus (15%) and group A Streptococcus (12%). Our epidemiologic investigation demonstrated both age and symptomatic presentation to be associated with a number of detected agents, including, but not limited to, influenza A and Plasmodium. Linear regression of fully-adjusted mean cycle threshold (C(t)) values for Plasmodium also identified statistically significant lower mean C(t) values for older children (20.8), patients presenting with severe fever (21.1) and headache (21.5), as well as patients admitted for in-patient care and treatment (22.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to employ two syndromic TaqMan Array Cards for the simultaneous survey of 57 different organisms to better characterize the type and prevalence of detected agents among febrile patients. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the association between adjusted mean C(t) values for Plasmodium and key clinical and demographic variables, which may further inform clinical decision-making based upon intensity of infection, as observed across endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa.","publish_time":"2017-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hercik, Christine; Cosmas, Leonard; Mogeni, Ondari D.; Wamola, Newton; Kohi, Wanze; Omballa, Victor; Ochieng, Melvin; Lidechi, Shirley; Bonventure, Juma; Ochieng, Caroline; Onyango, Clayton; Fields, Barry S.; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Montgomery, Joel M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/607d648e224430e7c79b94f6c2d770272616c5bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5747442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","Coxiella","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Moraxella","Klebsiella"],"organizations":["NP/OP","AFI TAC","AFI"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["Plasmodium","prevalence of detected agents","number of detected agents","febrile patients","AFI TAC","common agents","clinical settings","respiratory TAC","different microbial agents","values","adjusted mean C","clinical decision-making","epidemiologic survey","potential causative agents","blood specimens","AFI blood samples","severe fever","OP specimens","numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness","enhanced clinical microbiology","robust epidemiologic investigation","significant lower mean C","respiratory TaqMan Array Cards","exploratory study of fever syndrome","syndromic TaqMan Array Cards","differential diagnosis of fever syndrome","NP","year","nucleic acid","agent detection","treatment","Streptococcus pneumoniae","yrs","empiric case management of febrile illness","use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance","mean cycle threshold","low-resource settings","advanced diagnostics","oral-pharyngeal","laboratory diagnostics","naso-pharyngeal","different organisms","simultaneous survey","demographic variables","endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa","appropriate care","Linear regression","symptomatic presentation","surveyed population","symptomatic onset","in-patient care","Klebsiella pneumoniae","multi-pathogen detection","result of limited access","behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression","routine","healthcare providers","associations","type","older children","intensity of infection","viruses","axillary temperature","Haemophilus influenzae","INTRODUCTION","analysis","Coxiella burnetii","West Nile virus","Staphylococcus aureus","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica","Bartonella","Human Rhinovirus","Moraxella catarrhalis","days","headache","Leptospira","Rickettsia","bacteria","Enterovirus","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. The human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY) are analysed as a proof-of-concept study. We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed. But a long sharp straight line on the GGFM breaks such a landscape compatibility, distinguishing GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7.chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY. We delete a 1.30-Mbp target segment to rescue the landscape compatibility, matching the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. We re-locate it into the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY, matching a gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY.

The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of the literature related to the most used social network worldwide (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Instagram) in the field of psychology. Specifically, this study will assess the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, author productivity, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. METHODS: Publications related to social media in the field of psychology published between 2004 and 2014 were obtained from the Web of Science. The records extracted were analysed for bibliometric characteristics such as the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. VOSviewer v.1.6.5 was used to construct scientific maps. RESULTS: Overall, 959 publications were retrieved during the period between 2004 and 2015. The number of research publications in social media in the field of psychology showed a steady upward growth. Publications from the USA accounted for 57.14% of the total publications and the highest h-index (48).The most common document type was research articles (873; 91.03%). Over 99.06% of the publications were published in English. Computers in Human Behavior was the most prolific journal.

Here we show that the CORVET-specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 also regulate vesicular transport from early to recycling endosomes. Vps3 and Vps8 localise to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and co-localise with the CHEVI complex on Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Depletion of Vps3 or Vps8 does not affect transferrin recycling, but delays the delivery of internalised integrins to recycling endosomes and their subsequent return to the plasma membrane. Consequently, Vps3/8 depletion results in defects in integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration.

The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.","publish_time":"2018-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ha Kyun; Kim, Hyun Jung; Kim, Jae Hyung; Kim, Tae Hoon; Lee, Sang Hag","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89d27a03696c2c515c9477eb696580d6041835e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5849312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rat nasal mucosa","human nasal mucosa","nasal cavities","nasal cycle","nasal mucosa of healthy controls","pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa","congested mucosa","BMAL1 genes","distribution pattern of clock genes","expression levels of MUC5AC","key mucin genes","different expression levels","MUC5AC levels","PER2","present study","distribution pattern of PER1","allergic patients","rhythmic circadian manner","normal controls","circadian rhythm","circadian oscillators","left cavities","right","allergic rhinitis patients","rhythmic variability","molecular level","normal rats","day-night environmental cycle","self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms","regular light","superficial epithelium","Numerous peripheral tissues","maintenance","dark cycles","results"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies demonstrated the potent contribution of adipose tissue\u2019s renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to systemic RAS, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure (BP). In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure and postnatal HF diet on RAS of adipose tissue. METHODS: RAS and BP of 6-month old rats exposed to prenatal DEX and/or postnatal HF diet were examined. RESULTS: Prenatal DEX plus postnatal HF exerted a synergistic effect on systolic BP. Prenatal DEX exposure suppressed plasma angiotensin (ANG) I and ANG II, whereas postnatal HF suppressed plasma ANG-(1\u20137) level. Prenatal DEX increased prorenin receptor and renin levels, but suppressed angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme 1 (ACE1) mRNA expressions in adipose tissue. Postnatal HF increased AGT mRNA expression, but suppressed prorenin receptor, renin, ACE2, ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and Mas receptor (MasR) mRNA expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal GC exposure altered the ACE1/ANG II/ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, whereas postnatal HF negatively impacted the ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR axis. Prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF synergistically elevated BP through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose RAS.

Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans.","publish_time":"2018-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujihira, Haruhiko; Usami, Katsuaki; Matsuno, Keita; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Denda-Nagai, Kaori; Furukawa, Jun-ichi; Shinohara, Yasuro; Takada, Ayato; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Irimura, Tatsuro","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11115aa43542f817d78ca0c8ec2b50e04eb7cc17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5882653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["GPs","MGL","CD301","extended N-glycans","viral infectivity","low infectivity of REBOV","ZEBOV","O-glycans","N-glycan extension","structural analysis of glycans","replacement of aforementioned N-terminal","interaction","Reston ebolaviruses","Zaire ebolaviruses","differential mortality","amino acids","macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin","varying degrees of mortality","amino acid residues","structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins","humans","counter receptors","crucial roles","species","molecular basis","data"],"language":"en"},

Our goal was to evaluate a novel human monoclonal antibody (mAb) probe directed against the Gram-positive bacterial surface molecule lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Specificity and affinity were assessed in vitro. We then radiolabeled the anti-LTA mAb and evaluated its effectiveness as a diagnostic imaging tool for detecting infection via immunoPET imaging in an in vivo mouse model of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). In vitro and ex vivo binding of the anti-LTA mAb to pathogenic bacteria was measured with Octet, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The in vivo PJI mouse model was assessed using traditional imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]NaF as well as X-ray computed tomography (CT), before being evaluated with the zirconium-89-labeled antibody specific for LTA ([(89)Zr]SAC55). The anti-LTA mAb exhibited specific binding in vitro to LTA-expressing bacteria. Results from imaging showed that our model could reliably simulate infection at the surgical site by bioluminescent imaging, conventional PET tracer imaging, and bone morphological changes by CT. One day following injection of both the radiolabeled anti-LTA and isotype control antibodies, the anti-LTA antibody demonstrated significantly greater (P \u003C 0.05) uptake at S. aureus-infected prosthesis sites over either the same antibody at sterile prosthesis sites or of control non-specific antibody at infected prosthesis sites. Taken together, the radiolabeled anti-LTA mAb, [(89)Zr]SAC55, may serve as a valuable diagnostic molecular imaging probe to help distinguish between sterile inflammation and infection in the setting of PJI.

Today humanity is facing another infectious threat: a newly emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. It was already described that COVID-19 mortality among elderly people and people with such underlying conditions as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes s increased. Dysregulation of the immune responses vital for antiviral defense, which are typical for chronic inflammation, led us to a hypothesis that chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for increased susceptibility and mortality from COVID-19. Method. Based on the available information for 126 countries, statistical analysis to find out whether the difference in incidence and mortality within countries can be explained by the existing chronic inflammation among the countries population, was conducted. Results. A positive correlation between the percentage of people dying from chronic noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19 incidence (p\u003C0.001) and mortality (p\u003C0.001) within countries. Conclusion. The problem of COVID-19-caused high mortality rate may be a consequence of the high number of people having chronic low-grade inflammation as a precondition, and thus, one of the potential ways to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality is to focus on this widespread health problem, mainly occurring in developed countries and to take corresponding diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tskhay, A.; Yezhova, A.; Alibek, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20099572v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic low-grade inflammation","existing chronic inflammation","problem of COVID","chronic respiratory diseases","chronic noncommunicable diseases","developed countries","high mortality rate","countries population","percentage of people","elderly people","high number of people","cardiovascular diseases","incidence","increased susceptibility","risk of morbidity","main risk factor","diabetes s increased","widespread health problem","underlying conditions","obesity","cancer","consequence","antiviral defense","corresponding diagnostic","immune responses vital","emerging virus SARS-CoV","infectious threat","preventative","statistical analysis","difference","hypothesis","treatment measures","available information","Dysregulation","potential ways","positive correlation","precondition","humanity","Abstract Background","Method","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug, tenatoprazole, was previously shown to bind to ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the release of HSV particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with an EC50 of 0.8 \u03BCM, which is more potent than tenatoprazole. Finally, we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole-based analogs that demonstrate both binding to Tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of HIV-1 from 293T cells. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses, by interrupting cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell. Importance These results provide the basis for the development of drugs that target enveloped virus budding that can be used ultimately to control multiple virus infections in humans.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leis, Jonathan; Luan, Chi-Hao; Audia, James E.; Dunne, Sara F.; Heath, Carissa M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["release of HIV","prazole drugs","release of HSV particles","release of infectious HIV","release process","maturing virus","enveloped virus families","multiple virus infections","T cells","tenatoprazole","subsequent viral budding","prazole-based compounds","related prazole drug","Vero cells","budding process","multiple novel prazole-based analogs","multiple enveloped viruses","viral structural proteins","infectious Herpes Simplex Virus","inhibition of viral egress","viral life cycle","cell nuclear membrane","development of drugs","nanomolar range of HIV","class of drugs","ESCRT complex member Tsg101","ilaprazole","results","culture","host ESCRT complex proteins","cellular Tsg101 interaction","infected cell membranes","membrane scission","mechanical means","broad-spectrum antiviral agents","potential","step","binding","basis","accumulation","\u03BCM","EC50","humans","Importance","electron microscopy","nucleus","report"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Information was collected on the first COVID-19 cases according to the First Few X WHO protocol. Case-control analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms and risk factors for infection were conducted. Point prevalences of underlying health conditions among the UK general population were presented. Findings: The majority of FF100 cases were imported (51.4%), of which the majority had recent travel to Italy (71.4%). 24.7% were secondary cases acquired mainly through household contact (40.4%). Children had lower odds of COVID-19 infection compared with the general population. The clinical presentation of cases was dominated by cough, fever and fatigue. Non-linear relationships with age were observed for fever, and sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age. Conditions associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (after adjusting for age and sex) were chronic heart disease, immunosuppression and multimorbidity. Conclusion: This study presents the first epidemiological and clinical summary of COVID-19 cases in Great Britain. The FFX study design enabled systematic data collection. The study was able to characterize the risk factors for infection with population prevalence estimates setting these relative risks into a public health context.

While this clinical spectrum is well documented, its immunologic underpinnings are less clear. We have therefore, initiated studies of the B cell responses as they would participate in both early effector responses and in the initiation of memory formation. In terms of effector responses, we were particularly interested in the engagement and clinical correlates of the extra-follicular pathway (EF), we recently described in flaring SLE. In this systemic autoimmune disease, the EF pathway is initiated by newly activated naive B cell (aN) leading to large expansion of autoantibody-producing antibody-secreting cells through the generation of an epigenetically primed B cell precursor which are double negative (DN) for naive (IgD) and memory markers (CD27) and lacking expression of CXCR5 and CD21 (DN2). These highly activated D2 cells are also distinguished by high expression of CD11c and T-bet and are TLR7-driven. Both, TLR7-stimulation which is triggered by ssRNA and the central role played by their murine counterparts (typically characterized as Age-Associated B cells), in viral clearance, strongly supported the hypothesis that DN2 cells and the global EF pathway could be prominently engaged in COVID-19 patients. Also of note, EF B cell activation is particularly prominent in SLE patients of African-American ancestry, a population disproportionately represented in severe COVID-19. In this study we find that critically-ill patients with COVID-19 robustly upregulate constituents of the extrafollicular pathway, produce enormous numbers of antibody secreting cells, and lose unique transitional B cell populations that correlate with positive prognosis. This patient cluster associates tightly with biomarkers of poor outcomes and exhibits high rates of mortality. Thus, this B cell phenotype might serve as an immunological marker of severe COVID infection at early stages and could therefore identify a patient subset likely to benefit from targeted immunomodulatory therapy aimed at alleviating disease burden.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woodruff, M.; Ramonell, R.; Cashman, K.; Nguyen, D.; Ley, A.; Kyu, S.; Saini, A.; Haddad, N.; Chen, W.; Howell, J.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of suspect cases of COVID-19 in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico, and to compare their characteristics with those of non-migrants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of information from the surveillance system of Mexico from January 1 to May 3 2020, identifying persons from the main sending countries of mixed migrant flows in Mexico (Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela and African countries), in northern and southern Mexican border states. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk conditions, and epidemic curves for migrants and non-migrants. Also, we estimated the cumulative incidence for non-migrants, and for migrants in two scenarios defined by different estimations of their population size. RESULTS: Migrants were on average younger, had less accompanying risk conditions, and a lower percentage of suspect cases tested positive for COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization were lower among migrants, but the difference disappeared after adjusting by age, gender and underlying risk conditions. The cumulative incidence ratios comparing migrants with non-migrants were 6.12 (CI95% 4.75,7.77) for the first scenario, and 1.49 (CI95% 1.15,1.89) for the second scenario.

Abstract Acute respiratory infections, which are commonly caused by viruses, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In Argentina, national surveillance programs for the detection of respiratory viruses are usually performed by using immunofluorescence (IF) assays, although it is well known that molecular methods are more sensitive. An automated multiplex PCR device, the FilmArray-Respiratory Panel (FilmArray-RP), can detect 17 viral and 3 bacterial pathogens in a closed system that requires only 5min of hands-on time and 1h of instrumentation time. A total of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age suffering from acute respiratory infections, were studied by IF for 8 respiratory viruses and by RT-PCR for rhinoviruses. Later, these samples were tested by the FilmArray-RP. The positivity frequency obtained for the 9 viruses tested was 75% by IF/RT-PCR and 92% by the FilmArray-RP. The positive and negative percent agreement between both methods was 70.5% whereas the negative percent agreement was 99.6% (95% confidence interval:65.5-75.1 and 99.2-99.8 respectively). The FilmArray-RP allowed a higher positive diagnosis (97%) and detected other viruses such as coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1 (10%) and bocavirus (18%). In addition, this method identified multiple coinfections (39%) with 2, 3, 4 and up to 5 different viruses. At present, IF is still the most frequently used method in most Latin American countries for respiratory viruses diagnosis due to its low cost, its capability to process a high number of samples simultaneously and the fast determination of results for the most frequent viruses, which are available within 5h. However, the coming incorporation of molecular methods in routine procedures will significantly increase the diagnostic yield of these infections.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcone, D\u00E9bora N.; Carballal, Guadalupe; Ricarte, Carmen; Echavarria, Marcela","journal":"Revista Argentina de Microbiolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bdca750e8aa93db739f513bcd1eddd854380d2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754115000036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754115000036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["y los bocavirus","FilmArray-RP","por PR-FilmArray fue","y hasta","y RT-PCR fue","FilmArray-Respiratory Panel","virus respiratorios y por RT-PCR para rinovirus","virus estudiados por","respiratory viruses diagnosis","y detect\u00F3 otros virus","OC43 y HKU1","detection of respiratory viruses","procesamiento y una","respiratory samples","los programas","considerar los","PR-FilmArray permiti\u00F3 obtener","frequent viruses","different viruses","muestras simult\u00E1neamente y porque los resultados","los virus m\u00E1s frecuentes est\u00E1n disponibles en","virus respiratorios por su bajo costo","infecciones respiratorias agudas por","En Argentina","por su capacidad para procesar","como los coronavirus NL63","Abstract Acute respiratory infections","Resumen Las infecciones respiratorias agudas producen una importante morbimortalidad y com\u00FAnmente son causadas por virus","m\u00E9todo m\u00E1s utilizado en los pa\u00EDses latinoamericanos para","muestras respiratorias","PCR m\u00FAltiples que detecta","ant\u00EDgenos virales por inmunofluorescencia","aunque es bien conocido que los m\u00E9todos moleculares son m\u00E1s sensibles","acuerdo negativo fue","automated multiplex PCR device","vigilancia epidemiol\u00F3gica se basan en","estas muestras se estudiaron","Se evalu\u00F3","children","negative percent agreement","total","acuerdo positivo entre ambas metodolog\u00EDas fue","coming incorporation of molecular methods","mayor diagn\u00F3stico positivo","higher positive diagnosis","h of instrumentation time","high number of samples","m\u00E9todos moleculares aumentar\u00EDa notablemente","sistema cerrado que requiere","capacidad diagn\u00F3stica","permiti\u00F3 identificar coinfecciones m\u00FAltiples","used method","panel respiratorio","hands-on time","alto n\u00FAmero","detecci\u00F3n","equipo comercial automatizado","bacterias","futura incorporaci\u00F3n","Latin American countries","a\u00F1os","contin\u00FAa siendo","years of age suffering","routine procedures","ni\u00F1os menores","porcentaje","national surveillance programs","positividad","low cost","important cause of morbidity","bacterial pathogens","capability","mortality","fast determination of results","Adem\u00E1s","Posteriormente","instrumentaci\u00F3n","Sin embargo","diagnostic yield","closed system","addition","multiple coinfections","intervalo","frecuencia","Actualmente","immunofluorescence","positivity frequency","rhinoviruses","confidence interval","assays","confianza","respectivamente","present"],"language":"en"},

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness in order to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear who is lonely in lockdown? Methods: This study compared socio-demographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n=31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL COVID-19 Social Study, n=60,341). Results: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical prior to and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone, and urban residents had a higher odds of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk for being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30, people with low household income, and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to usual (indicated by higher coefficients). Further, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those socio-demographic groups already identified as high-risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but to have an even higher odds than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1483a3a7772c24bbe42b7b61c0e09ca24526470.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101360v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","UCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","loneliness relative","people","current COVID","UCL COVID","higher risk factor","low-risk groups","socio-demographic predictors of loneliness","UK adults","higher odds","Risk factors","Young adults","heightened risk","higher coefficients","socio-demographic groups","UK Household Longitudinal Study","Social Study","low household income","lockdown measures","previous research","cross-cohort analyses of data","lower education","women","major public health concern","impact","urban residents","order","interventions","necessary support","student","Results","Conclusions","Findings","Methods","rise","Background"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has spread widely in Iceland outside of the high-risk groups. Several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly. Children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males. To contain the pandemic we must increase the scope of the testing.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gudbjartsson, Daniel F; Helgason, Agnar; Jonsson, Hakon; Magnusson, Olafur T; Melsted, Pall; Norddahl, Gudmundur L; Saemundsdottir, Jona; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Sulem, Patrick; Agustsdottir, Arna B; Eiriksdottir, Berglind; Fridriksdottir, Run; Gardarsdottir, Elisabet E; Georgsson, Gudmundur; Gretarsdottir, Olafia S; Gudmundsson, Kjartan R; Gunnarsdottir, Thora R; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Holm, Hilma; Jensson, Brynjar O; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonsson, Frosti; Josefsdottir, Kamilla S; Kristjansson, Thordur; Magnusdottir, Droplaug N; le Roux, Louise; Sigmundsdottir, Gudrun; Sveinbjornsson, Gardar; Sveinsdottir, Kristin E; Sveinsdottir, Maney; Thorarensen, Emil A; Thorbjornsson, Bjarni; Love, Arthur; Masson, Gisli; Jonsdottir, Ingileif; Moller, Alma; Gudnason, Thorolfur; Kristinsson, Karl G; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c016d8d0a0e01eaa2f449c5c779a6ecce82ff17.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044446","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iceland"],"keyphrases":["testing groups","later targeted testing","early targeted testing","population screening","targeted testing of high-risk individuals","CONCLUSION SARS-CoV","general population","Icelandic population","common clades","Fewer females","high-risk groups","clade composition","B clade","Italian","A2a2","Austrian skiing areas","years old","BACKGROUND Limited data","infections","adults","A2a1","spreads","strategies","Large fractions of positives","relative contribution","strains","A1a","Children","METHODS","scope","time","pandemic","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells. The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Annessa, Ilda; Marchetti, Filippo; Colombo, Giorgio","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bde031fb77d6dc9c564f982e8646af6e8d87e46a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Receptor Binding Domain"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV","region of SARS","D structures of SARS","SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies","homologous proteins","Spike proteins","binding epitopes","Receptor Binding Domain","development of therapeutic","development of novel therapeutic","diagnostic molecules","results","protein-protein interaction regions","previous knowledge of binding properties","cell receptor ACE2","cell receptors","diagnostic interventions","viral entry","prediction of antibody","mechanisms of recognition","observation","characterized viruses","host cells","developed energy-based methods","study","diffusion","human health","sequence differences","major threat","structure of RBDs","distinctive traits","rational basis","world","isolation","immunoreactive","appearance","comparative analyses","dramatic consequences","immune system","analysis focusses","data","counterpart"],"language":"en"},

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the gold standard but is time-consuming with significant false negative results. Therefore, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence\u0027s deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19\u0027s specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%.

The number of screening tests carried out in France and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR).

The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor x 8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data.

Information on cases reported from March 2 to April 4 was collated from government records. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for the spread of an infectious disease was used. Transmission parameters were extracted from existing literature that has emerged over past weeks from other regions with similar population densities as Telangana. Optimisation algorithms were used to get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pant, Rashmi; Choudhry, Lincoln Priyadarshi; Rajesh, Jammy Guru; Yeldandi, Vijay V","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22022574be820f2b5cc4e2d23ac1fdc089aa3057.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20070292v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","Telangana"],"keyphrases":["Transmission parameters","similar population densities","population aggregated trajectories of COVID19 susceptible","draconian enforcement of population lockdown","different trajectories","susceptible-infected","different geographical locations","partial social distancing","social distancing mechanism","different phases of nonpharmaceutical interventions","dead cases","COVID19 case","government records","face hygiene adherence","south Indian state of Telangana","micro-clusters","basic reproduction rate","regions","hand","unique characteristics of susceptibility","past weeks","complexity","existing literature","spread","real world scenarios","vulnerable individuals","SIR","models","country","epidemic","study","infectious disease","Optimisation algorithms","Peak accumulation","end","number of deaths","caution","Information","data"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, this also includes digital innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for prevention, diagnostic and treatment. Amongst the many challenges during a pandemic, innovation and manufacturing stakeholders find themselves engaged in new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual property (IP) related challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic to identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on challenges related to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to manufacture CC-Products in the huge volumes suddenly in demand. Its purpose is to provide a structure for steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in fighting a pandemic. We identify 4 stakeholder groups concerned with IP challenges: (i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical IP, described as incumbents in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii) manufacturing firms from other sectors normally not producing CC-Products suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products (new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during a pandemic. This paper discusses IP challenges related to the development and manufacturing of technologies and products for (i) prevention (of spread), (ii) diagnosis of infected patients and (iii) the development of treatments. We offer an initial discussion of potential response measures to reduce IP associated risks among industrial stakeholders during a pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tietze, Frank; Vimalnath, Pratheeba; Aristodemou, Leonidas; Molloy, Jenny","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2db667dcf198503bc30163c72282dcc7a9721e1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03715v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CC-Products","CC-Sectors","manufacturing of CC","related challenges","pandemic related IP considerations","IP perspective","steering clear of IP challenges","manufacturing Crisis-Critical Products","existing Crisis-Critical IP","IP associated risks","Crisis-Critical Sectors","manufacturing stakeholders","manufacturing of technologies","manufacturing firms","prevention","development of treatments","paper","industrial stakeholders","new relationships","new entrants","huge volumes","huge quantities","international innovation systems","AI","open data platforms","complex epidemiological models","initial discussion of potential response measures","large-scale action","research","urgent upscaling of capacity","structure","organisations","intellectual property","incumbents","digital innovations","actors","resources","COVID","delays","stakeholder groups","governments","diagnosis of infected patients","voluntary grassroot initiatives","spread","demand","focus","purpose"],"language":"en"},

As-grown nontoxic Cin-NCs suspended in the citric acid of pH 4.5 (acted as organic solvent) were characterised thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical and bactericidal properties. The effects of various laser fluences (LF) at the fixed wavelength (532 nm) on the physiochemical properties of these Cin-NCs were determined. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs displayed the symmetric-asymmetric stretching of the functional groups attached to the heterocyclic/cinnamaldehyde compounds. The HR-TEM image of the optimum sample revealed the nucleation of the crystalline spherical Cin-NCs with a mean diameter of approximately 10 \u00B1 0.3 nm and lattice fringe spacing around 0.14 nm. In addition, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) and optical density (OD600) of the proposed Cin-NCs were measured to assess their antibacterial potency against the Staphylococcus aureus (IZD \u2248 24 mm) and Escherichia coli (IZD \u2248 25 mm) bacterial strains. The strong UV absorption (in the range of 269 and 310 nm) shown by these NCs was established to be useful for the antibacterial drug development and food treatment.","publish_time":"2020-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salim, Ali Aqeel; Bakhtiar, Hazri; Ghoshal, Sib Krishna; Huyop, Fahrul","journal":"Optics \u0026 Laser Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be60082c937ae452c7d63ed95bec1e9bebcd7296.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0030399220309646; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399220309646","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTIR","IZD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed Cin-NCs","nontoxic Cin-NCs","crystalline spherical Cin-NCs","nm","IZD","mean diameter","antibacterial potency","optical density","physiochemical properties","bactericidal properties","organic solvent","new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters","Abstract Biomedical values of organic natural cinnamon","antibacterial drug development","inhibition zone diameter","effects of various laser fluences","eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation","liquid","LF","optimum sample","functional groups","PLAL","symmetric-asymmetric stretching","nucleation","OD600","food treatment","range","Staphylococcus aureus","HR-TEM image","citric acid of pH","fixed wavelength","strong UV absorption","approach","addition","factor","lattice fringe","FTIR spectra","cinnamaldehyde compounds","Escherichia coli","bacterial strains","bulk counterpart","nanosizing"],"language":"en"},

As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines (\u0027lock-downs\u0027) to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges. Methods and analysis We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study findings narratively and will consider meta-analysis if \u003E=3 suitable studies with comparable interventions and outcomes are available. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. We plan to disseminate findings via pre-print, journal publication, through social media and web-based platforms and through direct stakeholder engagement.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braithwaite, I.; Callender, T.; Bullock, M.; Aldridge, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a3e8c974bc68c29b0273ee771553046d7f37930.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.20063636v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBSCO Medical COVID","OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact tracing of COVID","semi-automated digital contact tracing","effectiveness of automated","contact tracing methods","semi-automated digital tools","control of COVID","development of local epidemics of COVID","EBSCO Medical COVID information portal","social media","widespread social distancing measures","case isolation","pre-print papers","advanced public health systems","pandemic potential","key considerations","pandemic influenza","suitable studies","meta-analysis","heavy human","human populations","healthcare systems","study findings","OVID Global Health","Introduction Traditional approaches","rapid systematic review","mass quarantines","web-based platforms","conjunction","Cochrane Library","medRxiv","EMBASE","journal publication","high-income countries","BioRxiv","comparable interventions","outcomes","SARS","lock-downs\u0027","direct stakeholder engagement","transmission","successful implementation","MERS","governments","arXiv","peer","Ebola","PubMed","societal costs","respiratory disease","dissemination Ethical approval","Ethics","community testing","exit strategies","lockdowns","technology","challenges","English","result"],"language":"en"},

With rapidly evolving demands on healthcare resources, it is imperative that healthcare systems have the ability to access real-time local data to predict, plan, and effectively manage resources. Objective: To develop an interactive COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) as a data visualization tool to inform decision making and guide a large health system\u0027s proactive pandemic response. Methods: We designed and implemented CURVE using R Shiny to display real-time parameters of healthcare utilization at Atrium Health with projections based upon locally derived models for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the CURVE app to compare predictions from two of our models: one created before and one after the statewide stay-at-home and social distancing orders (denoted before- and after-SAH-order model). We established parameter settings for best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenarios for pandemic spread and resource use, leveraging two locally developed forecasting models to determine peak date trajectory, resource use, and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted results. Results: CURVE predicts and monitors utilization of hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators in the context of up-to-date local resources and provides Atrium Health leadership with timely, actionable insights to guide decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The after-SAH-order model demonstrated the lowest RMSE in total bed, ICU bed, and patients on ventilators. Conclusions: CURVE provides a powerful, interactive interface that provides locally relevant, dynamic, timely information to guide health system decision making and pandemic preparedness.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, S.-H.; Kearns, J.

We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors. Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity. Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kahathuduwa, Chanaka N; Dhanasekara, Chathurika S; Chin, Shao-Hua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0a6c04a855281aa153a7615b7fa2458e9b70f62.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","LDH","CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case fatality of COVID","critical illness","case detection","Estimated case fatality rate","meta-analysis","radiological risk factors","Meta-regression analyses","Pooled rates of severe illness","prevalence of severe","greater risk","publication bias","moderator effects of potential risk factors","Random-effects meta-analyses","critical disease","prevalence rates","surveillance","patients","increased severity","Results","elevated CRP","elevated LDH","empirical studies","potential underreporting","preventive measures","importance of strict adherence","presentation","Web of Science","dyspnea","clinicians","biases","data synthesis","systematic review","endophenotypes","pre-specified keywords","PubMed","Scopus","Hypertension","fever","limitation","denominators","Peer","age","outbreak","Methods","PRISMA guidelines","challenge","Numerators","individuals","Background","estimates","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province-level in Iran. In the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how the socioeconomic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran, which indicated that the spread of COVID-19 within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, literacy is a protective factor that might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that policies related to social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be targeted to reduce SARS-CoV2 spread in Iran. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within Iran.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ram\u00EDrez-Aldana, Ricardo; Gomez-Verjan, Juan Carlos; Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071605v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran","Islamic Republic"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","model COVID","number of cases","higher number of COVID","higher rates of COVID","health literacy","significant spatial clusters of cases","spatial statistical approach","Islamic Republic of Iran","connected provinces","cluster of provinces","Spatial modeling","socioeconomic features of Iranian provinces","higher average temperatures","public health measures","older adults","affected countries","present paper","older population structures","outbreaks","compliance","similar characteristics","social distancing","sociodemographic factors","upturn","vulnerable populations","province-level","understanding of structural","policies","Tehran","protective factor","SARS-CoV2","deaths","date"],"language":"en"},

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value \u003E5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Rui; Zhang, Leike; Li, Shiliang; Sun, Yuan; Ding, Minyi; Wang, Yong; Zhao, Yongliang; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Shan, Jiwei; Shen, Zihao; Tong, Yi; Xu, Liuxin; Yu, Chen; Liu, Yingle; Zou, Gang; Lavillete, Dimitri; Zhao, Zhenjiang; Wang, Rui; Zhu, Lili; Xiao, Gengfu; Lan, Ke; Li, Honglin; Xu, Ke","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b566a9544642207c9d03dc6f79507641d1fed0c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.983056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAA","DHODH","HTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Zika virus","virus-specificity","Ebola virus","new viruses","low virus replication","anti-virus treatment","various RNA viruses","re-emerging RNA viruses","old drugs","development of new DAA drugs","high antiviral efficacy","dual actions of antiviral","broad-spectrum antiviral effects","broad spectrum of viruses","S312","Existing direct-acting antiviral","HTA","viral replication","drug combination of DAA","on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV","recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","potent inhibitors of DHODH","infected cells","S416","advanced influenza diseases","favorable drug","infected animals","attractive host target","potential viral mutagenesis","Leflunomide","immuno-repression","Teriflunomide","H9N2","promising strategy","H3N2","self-designed candidates","EC50","Oseltamivir","beginning","pharmacokinetic profiles","SI value","clinical potentials","nM","advantages","epidemics","pandemics","H1N1","outbreaks","work","COVID","matter","results"],"language":"en"},

Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers\u0027 SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nadj, Mario; Maedche, Alexander; Schieder, Christian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6341d9318b3bf05a4125940a1356458d08f470ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167923620300774; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923620300774?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of interactive analytical dashboard features","users of interactive analytical dashboards","effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards","interactive components","Analytical components","application of operational DSS","new types of interactive analytical dashboard features","operational decision-makers\u0027 SA","operational decision support systems","higher task performance","human eye","analysis","theoretical lens of SA","findings","optimization process","optimization problems","loop problem","loop syndrome","eye-tracking data","human cognitive abilities","situation awareness","influences","recent years","graphical user interfaces","laboratory experiment","individual","GUIs","Abstract","implementation","practitioners","designers","implications","resulting research model","participants","efforts","hypotheses","closing","expected value","organizations","paper","gap","danger","article","potential"],"language":"en"},

Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results.

Nef has been thought to have a negative effect on viral replication in vitro but has been shown in studies with SIV to be necessary in the establishment of viraemia in vivo. In vitro studies in various human cell lines have shown that Nef downregulates the expression of cell surface CD4 and thus could have effects on the immune response. We have generated four transgenic mouse lines, with constructs containing two different Nef alleles under the control of CD2 regulatory elements to examine the interaction of Nef with the host immune system in vivo. In adult transgenic mice we have found marked downregulation in the level of CD4 on the surface of double positive thymocytes and a decrease in the number of CD4\u002B T cells in the thymus. Functional analyses have revealed a decrease in the total activation of transgenic thymocytes by anti-CD3 epsilon antibody. By specific intracellular staining of T cells in such mice we have found CD4 colocalizing with a Golgi-specific marker. These results strongly suggest a Nef mediated effect on developing CD4 thymocytes resulting from interference of Nef in the intracellular trafficking or post-translational modification of CD4.","publish_time":"1993-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brady, H J; Pennington, D J; Miles, C G; Dzierzak, E A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nef"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of Nef","interference of Nef","CD4 colocalizing","number of CD4","level of CD4","developing CD4 thymocytes","Nef mediated effect","different Nef alleles","Nef gene product","expression of cell surface CD4","post-translational modification of CD4","total activation of transgenic thymocytes","decrease","adult transgenic mice","transgenic mouse lines","studies","specific intracellular staining of T cells","surface of double positive thymocytes","intracellular trafficking","various human cell lines","negative effect","immune response","regulatory protein of HIV","Golgi-specific marker","host immune system","control of CD2 regulatory elements","constructs","anti-CD3 epsilon antibody","marked downregulation","biological function","effects","SIV","viral replication","results","thymus","establishment of viraemia","Functional analyses"],"language":"en"},

Almost the same final yield of infectious SFV was obtained from double-infected cells as from cells infected with SFV alone. The rate of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the GC to the plasma membrane of the SFV glycoproteins was analysed by immunofluorescence, surface radioimmunoassay and pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, endoglycosidase H digestion and SDS-PAGE. The results showed that: the SFV glycoproteins were readily transported to the cell surface in double-infected cells, whereas the UUK glycoproteins were retained in the GC; the transport to the PM was retarded by approximately 20 min, due to a delay between the ER and the central Golgi; E1 of SFV appeared at the PM in a sialylated form.

Viral replication was restricted to the respiratory tract and associated with minimal to mild, multi-focal erosive and inflammatory changes in conducting airways, and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS.

The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined.

The assembly pathway of vaccinia virus displays several unique features, such as the production of two structurally distinct, infectious forms. One of these, termed intracellular naked virus (INV), remains cells associated while the other, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), is released from the cell. In addition, it has long been believed that INVs acquire their lipid envelopes by a unique example of de novo membrane biogenesis. To examine the structure and assembly of vaccinia virus we have used immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to proteins of different subcellular compartments as well as a phospholipid analysis of purified INV and EEV. Our data are not consistent with the de novo model of viral membrane synthesis but rather argue that the vaccinia virus DNA becomes enwrapped by a membrane cisterna derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step. Phospholipid analysis of purified INV supports its derivation from an early biosynthetic compartment. This unique assembly process is repeated once more when the INV becomes enwrapped by an additional membrane cisterna, in agreement with earlier reports. The available data suggest that after fusion between the outer envelope and the plasma membrane, mature EEV is released from the cell.","publish_time":"1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377e2c575da8f034d4f9f34d7ad6c4395487f348.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["INV","EEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assembly of vaccinia virus","vaccinia virus DNA","assembly pathway of vaccinia virus","large DNA virus","plasma membrane","extracellular enveloped virus","intracellular naked virus","additional membrane cisterna","novo membrane biogenesis","phospholipid analysis of purified INV","unique assembly process","novo model of viral membrane synthesis","unique example","unique features","mature EEV","host cell","intermediate compartment","available data","early biosynthetic compartment","antibodies","derivation","proteins of different subcellular compartments","immunoelectron microscopy","agreement","Poxviridae","outer envelope","fusion","production","lipid envelopes","cytoplasm","Golgi stacks","earlier reports","membranes","prototype","structure","infectious forms","INVs","cells","step"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the mechanism of localization of yeast TGN proteins, we used the heterologous protein A-ALP (consisting of the cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [DPAP A] fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of the vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), which localizes to the yeast TGN. Insertion of the aromatic residue\u2013based TGN localization motif (FXFXD) of DPAP A into the cytosolic domain of ALP results in a protein that resides in the TGN. We demonstrate that the FXFXD motif confers Golgi localization through retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment by detecting a post-Golgi processed form of this protein in the TGN. We present an assay that uncouples retrieval-mediated Golgi localization from static retention-based localization, allowing measurement of the rate at which proteins exit the yeast TGN. We also demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of DPAP A contains additional information, separate from the retrieval motif, that slows exit from the TGN. We propose a model for DPAP A localization that involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which the FXFXD motif directs retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment, and a second that slows the rate at which DPAP A exits the TGN.","publish_time":"1997-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bryant, Nia J.; Stevens, Tom H.","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f64ab87b255d034c48a5a7c8a8a82a4ea81e67b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2134822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2134822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGN","DPAP","ALP","FXFXD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based TGN localization motif","localization of proteins","yeast TGN proteins","retrieval-mediated Golgi localization","post-Golgi compartment","retrieval motif","mechanism of localization","cytosolic domain of DPAP","FXFXD motif","late-Golgi membranes","cytosolic domains","exit","static retention-based localization","cytosolic domain of ALP results","heterologous protein","cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase","rate","vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase","luminal domains","aromatic residues","motifs","measurement","additional information","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Insertion","distinct mechanisms","assay","model","signals"],"language":"en"},

If, however, leukocyte cultures are first exposed to virus and then to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE, significant enhancement of histamine release occurs. Both infectious and inactivated virus enhance histamine release and the degree of enhancement is related to the concentration of virus and the length of the incubation. Tissue culture fluid harvested 8 h after exposure of leukocytes to virus contains a soluble factor which is capable of enhancing histamine release when added to fresh leukocyte cultures.

Here we demonstrate that expression of SLC is undetectable in plt mice. In addition to the defect in T cell homing, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) fail to accumulate in spleen and LN T cell zones of plt mice. DC migration to LNs after contact sensitization is also substantially reduced. The physiologic significance of these abnormalities in plt mice is indicated by a markedly increased sensitivity to infection with murine hepatitis virus. The plt mutation maps to the SLC locus; however, the sequence of SLC introns and exons in plt mice is normal. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC mediates the entry of naive T cells and antigen-stimulated DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.","publish_time":"1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunn, Michael D.; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Tam, Carmen; Kakiuchi, Terutaka; Matsuzawa, Akio; Williams, Lewis T.; Nakano, Hideki","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b41e1c74739ae2195dc07a54fd9decaff5639b45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2192914.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2192914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LN T cell zones of plt mice","T cell zones of spleen","T cell homing","entry of naive T cells","expression of SLC","T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs","SLC locus","paucity of lymph node T cell","mice homozygous","plt mutation maps","LNs","sequence of SLC introns","dendritic cells","lymphoid regions of spleen","abnormalities","Secondary lymphoid organ chemokine","lymph nodes","genetic defect","antigen-stimulated DCs","exons","home","infection","high endothelial venules","increased sensitivity","murine hepatitis virus","physiologic significance","DC migration","sensitization","addition","findings"],"language":"en"},

Virus-specific CD8(\u002B) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during HCV infection could be involved in the induction of AIH. To explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary CTL response against an HLA-A*0201\u2013restricted HCV-derived epitope, i.e., HCV core 178\u2013187, which shows sequence homology with human CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 8\u201317. To determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of HCV-associated AIH, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary CTL responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic HCV infection. We found that the naive CTL repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive CTLs inducible by the HCV peptide recognizing both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 peptides as well as endogenously processed CYP2A6 protein. Importantly, we failed to induce CTLs with the CYP-derived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the HLA-A2 molecule.

For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8\u201310% carry 9-O-acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA(\u2212), HSA(\u2212), and TCR(hi) medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O-acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80\u2013 85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O-acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O-acetylation is also present on 90\u201395% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O-acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O-acetylated cells are Mel 14(hi), CD44(lo), and CD45R(exon B)(hi), features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O-sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O-acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O-acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O-acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O-acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O-acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O-acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.","publish_time":"1997-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krishna, Murli; Varki, Ajit","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba4c40b65eb342713e70c96a8d6336b22cca54fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2196344.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2196344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mel"],"organizations":["Influenza","PNA","SP","Influenza C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylated cells","CD4 cells","O-acetylation","peripheral CD4 T cells","activation of CD4 T cells","CD4 SP cells","O-acetylated gangliosides","O-sialoglycoprotease","recognition of O","mouse T cells","O-acetylated mucins","human T cells","O-acetylated sialic acids","B cells","medullary cells","lymph node CD4 T cells","O-acetyl esters","small minority of CD8 T cells","CD4 T cell lineage","mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells","typical of naive cells","mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes","O-linked mucintype glycoproteins","CD8 levels","CD4 SP phenotype","Terminal sialic acids","high levels","cell surface mucins","similar levels","low levels","cell surface glycoconjugates","CD8 single positive","CD8 double positive","Influenza C probe","DP","peripheral spleen","different cell types","high degree","contrast","mature PNA","novel marker","lesser degree","TCR ligation","exon B","Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase","early differentiation marker","mouse lymphoid organs","mucin glycoprotein component","normal B10","OSGPase","precise distribution","recombinant soluble form","secondary cross-linking","preferential expression","ELISA studies of lipid extracts","substantial decrease","sialylated glycolipids","trypsin","Mel","CD60 antibodies","maturation","great majority","CD45R","HSA","stimuli","Digestions","Correlation","CD44","technical reasons","total thymocytes"],"language":"en"},

Centromere localization was abolished if as few as 28 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus of CENP-B.

Tf10 was internalized about two times slower than Tf and was retained four times longer than Tf, without being degraded in CHO cells. The intracellular localization of Tf10 was investigated using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tf10 was not delivered to the lysosomal pathway followed by low density lipoprotein but remained accessible to Tf in the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment for at least 60 min. The retained Tf10 was TfR-associated as demonstrated by a reduction in surface TfR number when cells were incubated with Tf10. The presence of Tf10 within the recycling compartment did not affect trafficking of subsequently endocytosed Tf. Retention of Tf10 within the recycling compartment did not require the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR since Tf10 exited cells with the same rate when bound to the wild-type TfR or a mutated receptor with only four amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, cross-linking of surface receptors by a multivalent ligand acts as a lumenal retention signal within the recycling compartment. The data presented here show that the recycling compartment labeled by Tf10 is a long-lived organelle along the early endosome recycling pathway that remains fusion accessible to subsequently endocytosed Tf.","publish_time":"1995-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/151b29e4b482ad11ee11e83cec4f3faebb8124c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Retention of Tf10","retained Tf10","presence of Tf10","intracellular localization of Tf10","transferrin receptor","receptor cross-linking","endocytosed Tf","intracellular trafficking","pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment","altered receptor trafficking","mutated receptor","surface TfR number","early endosome recycling pathway","multivalent-transferrin","wild-type TfR","surface receptors results","CHO cells","multivalent ligand acts","lysosomal pathway","endocytic system","cytoplasmic domain","cytoplasmic tail","times slower","lumenal retention signal","long-lived organelle","low density lipoprotein","amino acids","fluorescence","molecular mechanisms","reduction","chemical cross","rate","electron microscopy","data"],"language":"en"},

A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs. RESULTS: We present a fully automated search method, EpiSearch that predicts the possible location of conformational epitopes on the surface of an antigen. The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu), the antibody mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C(2) domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17b and mAb b12 of the HIV envelope protein gp120, mAb 13b5 targeting HIV-1 capsid protein and 80R of the SARS coronavirus spike protein. In all these examples the conformational epitopes as determined by the X-ray crystal structures of the antibody-antigen complexes, were found within the highest scoring patches of EpiSearch, covering in most cases more than 50% residues of experimental observed conformational epitopes. Input options of the program include mapping of a single peptide or a set of peptides on the antigen structure, and the results of the calculation can be visualized on our interactive web server.

Recently, a PrP(Sc)-like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrP(C) (iPrP(C)) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrP(C) in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrP(T183A)) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrP(F198S)) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrP(C). Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrP(C) may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrP(T183A) aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.","publish_time":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Roger S.; Fujioka, Hisashi; Guo, Jian-Ping; Xiao, Xiangzhu; Shimoji, Miyuki; Kong, Crystal; Chen, Cecilia; Tasnadi, Megan; Voma, Chesinta; Yuan, Jue; Moudjou, Mohammed; Laude, Hubert; Petersen, Robert B.; Zou, Wen-Quan","journal":"Aging (Albany NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f1f94a49e088244c897fd0bfc96de817d1b804a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PrP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["insoluble PrP","PrP mutation","mutant human PrP","T183A cells","protease-resistant PrP species","T183A mutation","formation of iPrP","F198S cells","formed iPrP","cultured neuronal cells","cultured neuroblastoma cells","familial prion diseases","hallmark of prion diseases","Sc","residue","results","rich cellular prion protein","formation of insoluble aggregates","N-linked glycosylation sites","molecular mechanism","intracellular retention","intracellular compartment","molecular characteristics","inhibition of autophagy","rich pathological isoform","\u03B1-helix","wild-type","new insights","group of fatal transmissible encephalopathies","significant increase","uninfected mammalian brains","\u03B2-sheet","aggregation","Thr","intermediate form","Phe","Ser","Ala","distinct conformational transition","forms"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, it is important to identify and characterize the State\u2019s role and authority on matters related to public health, in order to verify whether it has access to such databases while engaging in public health genomic research. We first consider the evolution of the concept of public health, as well as its core functions, using a comparative approach (e.g. WHO, PAHO, CDC and the Canadian province of Quebec). Following an analysis of relevant Quebec legislation, the precautionary principle is examined as a possible avenue to justify State access to and use of genomic databases for research purposes. Finally, we consider the Influenza pandemic plans developed by WHO, Canada, and Quebec, as examples of key tools framing public health decision-making process. We observed that State powers in public health, are not, in Quebec, well adapted to the expansion of genomics research. We propose that the scope of the concept of research in public health should be clear and include the following characteristics: a commitment to the health and well-being of the population and to their determinants; the inclusion of both applied research and basic research; and, an appropriate model of governance (authorization, follow-up, consent, etc.). We also suggest that the strategic approach version of the precautionary principle could guide collective choices in these matters.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cousineau, J; Girard, N; Monardes, C; Leroux, T; Jean, M Stanton","journal":"Iran J Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71cb2319da3251ef1b4bc99ce5c4ca633b2cb1b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3468988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","Influenza"],"locations":["Quebec"],"keyphrases":["public health research","public health genomic research","concept of public health","concept of research","public health decision-making process","applied research","basic research","research purposes","expansion of genomics research","genomic databases","precautionary principle","Canadian province of Quebec","matters","State access","analysis of relevant Quebec legislation","comparative approach","State powers","following characteristics","strategic approach version","important source of information","examples of key tools","scientific progress","authorization","PAHO","appropriate model of governance","authority","multifactorial disorders","possible avenue","follow-up","genetics","Canada","CDC","inclusion","collective choices","commitment","consideration","State\u2019s role","core functions","consent","determinants","diseases","population","well-being","evolution","Influenza pandemic plans","context","scope"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the SARS coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in sera of 1700, including 1453 general populations from Hongkong, Marco, Guangzhou and Peking and 257 SARS patients from Guangzhou and Peking. The dynamics of the serum antibodies of SARS patients were observed from 3 to 360 days after onset of symptoms. RESULTS: 90% of 257 patient serum specimens after 20 days of disease onset showed positive SARS-CoV IgG either using ELISA or IFA. 257 SARS patients, antibodies titers increased steadily in early 4 to 6 months after onset of SARS. The titers of most cases came to the peak in the 6th month. then antibodies titers declined rapidly in some cases. However, all specimens still were positive for SARS-CoV IgG in the 48th month.

However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients (e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et al., 2020). In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\\\u0060a so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018). In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bassi, Francesca; Arbia, Giuseppe; Falorsi, Pietro Demetrio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/765b6a1ef74b71259df8fb1f06439fe90b6d3c73.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07268v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["g.

To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related design implications.","publish_time":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krekhov, Andrey; Cmentowski, Sebastian; Waschk, Andre; Kruger, Jens","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9ae8f62d5a3fc0638cfabda4efd61b7e109804b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04702v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target object","quantitative evaluations of Deadeye","recognizable highlighting technique","D visualizations","dichoptic presentation","paper","VR volume rendering","number of distractors","visual properties","prior approaches","prior work","multiple heterogeneous distractors","underlying visual cue","example application scenario","limitations","configurations","stereoscopic scenarios","important robustness challenge","additional setup","color","exploratory survey","method","binocular disparities","real-world conditions","preserved preattentiveness","average accuracies","benefits","motivation","community","contrast","related design implications","considerable drawback","given fact","possible workflow","applicability","box","case","follow-up","attention"],"language":"en"},

First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics. Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ordun, Catherine; Purushotham, Sanjay; Raff, Edward","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c36c0d73e7d0aa60fc3d7bb8cdcf06a7a10070a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03082v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["White House Coronavirus Task Force"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["distinct topics","different topics","Twitter users","median retweeting time of Covid19","Covid19 tweets","Covid19 Twitter literature","attention of Covid19 retweeters","distinctiveness of topics","distinct users","connections of users","fast information","quality of generated topics","sample corpus","slow retweeting","retweeting times","subsequent analysis","understanding of important themes","topic modeling","high-level themes","density of connections","different techniques","topic specific","retweet cascades","speed of information dissemination","machine learning methods","early-stage descriptive methods","regular expressions","UMAP","White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings","LDA","features","help","healthcare workers","key terms","network behaviors","repostings","personal protective equipment","Uniform Manifold Approximation","Projection","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Chinese social media","unique clustering-behavior","minutes","H7N9","uptick","government announcements","PPE","cases","increases","simplest highlights","paper","hours","pattern"],"language":"en"},

In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020 to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02.

Such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels (founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs. We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph. Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size $410\\times 29811$ is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only $3\\%$ of the size of the MSA.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makinen, Veli; Cazaux, Bastien; Equi, Massimo; Norri, Tuukka; Tomescu, Alexandru I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b216f710cf7a8d27ebb94fccf7da7650456d3eab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09342v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["founder segments","founder blocks","founder segmentation algorithms","set of founder sequences","graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs","MSA of size","MSA of SAR","maximum length","total length of node labels","linear time algorithm","paths","queries of arbitrary length","succinct index structure","linear time dynamic programming algorithms","functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index","optimal segmentation concept","Belazzougui","SPIRE","multiple sequence alignment","nodes","compact pangenome representation","Cunial","Cazaux","techniques","feature","CPM","CoV","recombination","minute","efficient string matching","possible concatenation orders","strains","key property","founders","Experiments","edges","segmentations","times"],"language":"en"},

Under non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. When we introduce different forms of social distancing interventions, peak caseloads are reduced, but infection rates of the poor are systematically higher than for non-poor across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and greater intensity of interventions are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor, vis-a-vis the non-poor. Increasing population leads to higher infection rates among the poor, supporting concerns that households in large high-density settlements like slums amongst the most at-risk population groups during an outbreak. Related to this, increasing population of the urban poor is found to worsen infection outcomes of the poor, and given the expansion of developing cities into large metropolises, this is an issue of significant concern for public health and economic wellbeing. The poor are also found disproportionately affected by increasing length and intensity of social distancing measures, pointing to the immediate need for countries to have clear guidelines on how social distancing can be practiced in high density slum settlements, given local contexts. Sustainable solutions for the long-term will require concerted investment in environmental and physical infrastructure to improve living conditions.

Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \\pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, {\\tt RNAinverse}, {\\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm {\\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures.

Our focus is the computational analysis of meaning of short scientific texts (abstracts or brief reports). In this paper, a vector space model is developed for quantifying the meaning of words and texts. We introduce the Meaning Space, in which the meaning of a word is represented by a vector of Relative Information Gain (RIG) about the subject categories that the text belongs to, which can be obtained from observing the word in the text. This new approach is applied to construct the Meaning Space based on Leicester Scientific Corpus (LSC) and Leicester Scientific Dictionary-Core (LScDC). The LSC is a scientific corpus of 1,673,350 abstracts and the LScDC is a scientific dictionary which words are extracted from the LSC. Each text in the LSC belongs to at least one of 252 subject categories of Web of Science (WoS). These categories are used in construction of vectors of information gains. The Meaning Space is described and statistically analysed for the LSC with the LScDC. The usefulness of the proposed representation model is evaluated through top-ranked words in each category. The most informative n words are ordered. We demonstrated that RIG-based word ranking is much more useful than ranking based on raw word frequency in determining the science-specific meaning and importance of a word. The proposed model based on RIG is shown to have ability to stand out topic-specific words in categories. The most informative words are presented for 252 categories. The new scientific dictionary and the 103,998 x 252 Word-Category RIG Matrix are available online. Analysis of the Meaning Space provides us with a tool to further explore quantifying the meaning of a text using more complex and context-dependent meaning models that use co-occurrence of words and their combinations.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzen, Neslihan; Mirkes, Evgeny M.; Gorban, Alexander N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cbb88c9cbb9360d5cc10c4ce69a99b05e7291a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13717v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Leicester Scientific Corpus","Leicester Scientific Dictionary-Core","LSC","RIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["meaning of words","Meaning Space","meaning of texts","science-specific meaning","informative words","co-occurrence of words","RIG-based word ranking","new scientific dictionary","context-dependent meaning models","Leicester Scientific Corpus","short scientific texts","topic-specific words","vector space model","informative n words","Word-Category RIG Matrix","Leicester Scientific Dictionary-Core","LScDC","raw word frequency","subject categories of Web","proposed model","abstracts","proposed representation model","vector of Relative Information Gain","computational analysis","information gains","new approach","automatic extracting","Natural Language Processing","brief reports","construction of vectors","importance","usefulness","ability","WoS","important problem","paper","tool","focus","combinations"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call \u0027DeepCOVIDExplainer\u0027.

Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive value(PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable approaches.

Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas.

The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Henry; Feng, Zhilan; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Levin, Simon A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45ec6aec7792e095702831ff0fe1ce9cd0f3881f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05549v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["staggered release policies","simultaneous release","sequential release of age","current policies","sequential timing of relaxing restrictions","optimal release policy","Strong social distancing restrictions","health risks","deleterious effect of restrictions","planning of disease management policies","strict social distancing protocols","testing of various timing choices","ongoing COVID","economic activity","economic stagnation relative","overall death rate","lower overall fatality rates","defined subgroups","terms","pandemic","future outbreaks","design","nature","individuals","model","step","order","insights","fragile sub-populations","paper","goal","lockdown","results","question"],"language":"en"},

To investigate if SARS-CoV-2 can affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNA-seq datasets of human embryos for the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike protein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and CTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the blastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4 and ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes that are differentially expressed in ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells as compared to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show that developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral internalization and replication.

The systems discussed here are given by mappings on an affine space over a finite field, whose coordinate functions are polynomials. They form a general class of models which can represent many discrete model types. Assigning to such a system its dependency graph, that is, the directed graph that indicates the variable dependencies, provides a mapping from systems to graphs. A basic property of this mapping is derived and used to prove that dynamical systems with an acyclic dependency graph can only have a unique fixed point in their phase space and no periodic orbits.

COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases, based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19 data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data. CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing, and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elmeiligy, Manar A.; Desouky, Ali I.

Methods: We performed a systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19, which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in men.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Xiyi; Xiao, Yu-Tian; Wang, Jian; Chen, Rui; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Yue; Lv, Daojun; Qin, Chao; Gu, Di; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Weidong; Hou, Jianquan; Song, Ninghong; Zeng, Guohua; Ren, Shancheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a705147176403a593b690b49d125cde92050d6c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13547v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sex-based differences","immunological differences","associations of sex differences","scRNA-seq","summary data","expression of ACE2","meta-analysis of current studies","ChIP-seq","observational studies","relevant studies","potential mechanisms","significant higher mortality rate","single-cell RNA sequencing","host cell receptor ACE2","available bulk RNA sequencing","increased severity","male populations","potential target","women","patients","chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing","clinical outcomes of COVID","expression of androgen receptor","female group","immunological microenvironments","increased risk","cellular compositions","pulmonary alveolar type","treatment of SARS","prevention","preprint servers","systematic review","Web of Science","cells","severe cases","inclusion criteria","lung","infections","Results","observed association","pooled odds ratio","PubMed","Methods","Objective","Conclusions","evidence","pathway","males"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon.

As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values. The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October 2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to 90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olivier, L.

Against this background Verity et al. (2020, Lancet Infections Diseases) have rapidly assembled case data and used statistical modelling to infer the IFR for COVID-19. We have attempted an in-depth statistical review of their approach, to identify to what extent the data are sufficiently informative about the IFR to play a greater role than the modelling assumptions, and have tried to identify those assumptions that appear to play a key role. Given the difficulties with other data sources, we provide a crude alternative analysis based on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship data and case data from China, and argue that, given the data problems, modelling of clinical data to obtain the IFR can only be a stop-gap measure.

MVM is designed for large-scale production in a short amount of time and at a limited cost, as it relays on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. Initial tests of a prototype device with a breathing simulator are also presented.

For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and a secondary angiotensin receptor. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor, and promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. Black vulnerability is likely based on physiological, not sociological, differences, which should guide treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forsdyke, Donald R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f8d656c802de2e698018f3243368c933c84f26d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01579v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2","primary angiotensin receptor","secondary angiotensin receptor","common angiotensin","decreased blood pressure","adaptations","hypertension","pressure of body fluids","progress of coronavirus infections","skin pigmentation","tropical heritage","Tropical climates","Temperature-dependence","temperature-dependent fall","promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects","negation of host pro-inflammatory effects","mechanisms","volume","long-term case-report","salt-content","influence of blockers","temperate climes","linkage","added risk","lung inflammation","enzyme","critical blocker dosage","detailed studies","Positive therapeutic results","differences","distant ancestors","virus entry","Black vulnerability","susceptibility","receptors","treatment"],"language":"en"},

To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing, contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19. Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases. Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in India. Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for the next stages of the outbreak evolution.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Kankan; Khajanchi, Subhas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ed51444c210f58c010f7d6a8e8ff454520a796.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07071v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["states of India","overall India","human transmission of COVID","transmission dynamics of COVID","SARS-CoV","end of SARS","mathematical model","global COVID","ongoing COVID","model simulations","outbreak evolution","reduction of outbreak","real data","estimated data","social distancing","estimated pandemic life cycle","end dates","strict control measures","parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle","community-wide elimination of SARS","evolution of epidemics","utmost priority","health care planning","therapeutics","forecasting","tracing","infected individuals","basic reproduction number","aids","influence of different policies","spread","vaccine","study","persistence","essential precautions","coronavirus","humans","history","state interventions","optimism","absence","Background","Interpretation","Findings","stages","complete figure","distress","mentality","diseases","Methods","Lockdown"],"language":"en"},

When training deep learning models under an FL setting, people employ the predefined model architecture discovered in the centralized environment. However, this predefined architecture may not be the optimal choice because it may not fit data with non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID). Thus, we advocate automating federated learning (AutoFL) to improve model accuracy and reduce the manual design effort. We specifically study AutoFL via Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which can automate the design process. We propose a Federated NAS (FedNAS) algorithm to help scattered workers collaboratively searching for a better architecture with higher accuracy. We also build a system based on FedNAS. Our experiments on non-IID dataset show that the architecture searched by FedNAS can outperform the manually predefined architecture.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Chaoyang; Annavaram, Murali; Avestimehr, Salman","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08546v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Federated Learning","Neural Architecture Search","Federated NAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predefined architecture","predefined model architecture","better architecture","Federated Learning","FedNAS","Neural Architecture Search","Federated NAS","model accuracy","non-IID dataset","deep learning models","effective learning framework","fit data","FL setting","study AutoFL","higher accuracy","centralized environment","design process","manual design effort","independent distribution","people","communication costs","privacy","optimal choice","workers","algorithm","regulatory restrictions","experiments","system"],"language":"en"},

In the meantime, global online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily, most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two ways: using controversial terms like\u0022Chinese Virus\u0022or\u0022Wuhan Virus\u0022, or using non-controversial terms like\u0022Coronavirus\u0022. In this study, we attempt to characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a major crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyu, Hanjia; Chen, Long; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15422c4bed72d8c10aa36afd59dc1b7140113363.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06307v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-controversial terms","usage of controversial terms","groups of Twitter users","Chinese Virus","COVID","anti-Chinese","Wuhan Virus","social media platforms","large-scale social media-based study","great number of people","number of followers","global online media coverage","related tweets","novel coronavirus","anti-Asian","related racial attacks","demographics","respect","user-level features","political following status","meantime","major crisis","information","world-wide development","classification models","significant differences","Tweepy API","authors","pandemic","ways","geo-locations","best knowledge","disease"],"language":"en"},

A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. Nevertheless, the standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to the pandemic. Researchers around the world have been looking for alternative screening methods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing promising results in the identification of COVID-19. Despite their success, the computational cost of these methods remains high, which imposes difficulties in their accessibility and availability. Thus, in this work, we propose to explore and extend the EfficientNet family of models using chest X-rays images to perform COVID-19 detection. As a result, we can produce a high-quality model with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and positive prediction of 100% while having about 30 times fewer parameters than the baseline literature model, 28 and 5 times fewer parameters than the popular VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures, respectively.

There are currently no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy for its prevention and little knowledge was known about the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use computational approaches to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human genome as well as the host miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs involved dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively, we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, and a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of TMPRSS2 with the function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut.

In fact, the induction of adaptive immune responses against Tumor Associated Antigens (TAAs) as well as innate immunity are important factors for tumor stabilization/eradication. A variety of immunization technologies have been explored in last decades and are currently under active evaluation, such as cell-based, protein, peptide and heat-shock protein-based cancer vaccines. Genetic vaccines are emerging as promising methodologies to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of antigens, including TAAs. Amongst these, Adenovirus (Ad)-based vectors show excellent immunogenicity profile and have achieved immunological proof of concept in humans. In vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA (DNA-EP) is also a desirable vaccine technology for cancer vaccines, as it is repeatable several times, a parameter required for the long-term maintenance of anti-tumor immunity. Recent findings show that combinations of different modalities of immunization (heterologous prime/boost) are able to induce superior immune reactions as compared to single-modality vaccines. In this review, we will discuss the challenges and requirements of emerging cancer vaccines, particularly focusing on the genetic cancer vaccines currently under active development and the promise shown by Ad and DNA-EP heterologous prime-boost.","publish_time":"2011-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aurisicchio, Luigi; Ciliberto, Gennaro","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/443aa07a6f57cab4c25fcdb0add50527028d6769.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3759217.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers3033687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24212974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tumor Associated Antigens"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic cancer vaccines","Genetic vaccines","requirements of emerging cancer vaccines","heat-shock protein-based cancer vaccines","long-term control of cancer","single-modality vaccines","tumor immunity","DNA-EP heterologous prime-boost","Tumor Associated Antigens","tumor stabilization","TAAs","based vectors","induction of adaptive immune responses","superior immune reactions","wide variety of antigens","electroporation of plasmid DNA","variety of immunization technologies","important factors","active development","important approach","innate immunity","active evaluation","combinations of different modalities of immunization","excellent immunogenicity profile","peptide","challenges","promising methodologies","immunological proof of concept","desirable vaccine technology","eradication","promise","Recent findings","Therapeutic vaccination","parameter","humans","decades","maintenance of","Adenovirus","times","therapies","review"],"language":"en"},

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs. Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-\u03BAB p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells. RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments. Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-\u03BAB p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P \u003C 0.05). In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-\u03BAB p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. The expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-\u03BAB p65 protein in lung tissue of WT mice exposed to the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than those in the model group. In WT mice exposed to hot and humid environments, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-\u03BAB p65 protein in XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. CONCLUSION: Guizhimahuanggebantang demonstrated a satisfactory therapeutic effect on mice infected with the influenza A virus (FM1 strain) in a normal environment, and Xinjiaxiangruyin demonstrated a clear therapeutic effect in damp and hot environments and may play a protective role against influenza through downregulation of the TLR7 signal pathway.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Ying-Jie; Yan, Yu-Qi; Zheng, Xiao; Shi, Shan-Shan; Wu, Sha; Jiang, Zhen-You","journal":"Chin Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f9545f7a7fee9a2b6d72c0cd36ca66687809be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6764144.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-019-0256-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of TLR7","virus group","MyD88","expression levels of TLR7","NF-\u03BAB p65 mRNA","XJXRY group","GZMHGBT group","model group","NF-\u03BAB p65 proteins","lung tissue of WT mice","normal environment","hot environments","controlling influenza virus","TLR7 signal pathway","humid environments","virus replication","hygrothermal environments","FM1 strain","alleviated lung inflammation","reduced lung inflammation","messenger RNA expression of Toll","C57BL","Guizhimahuanggebantang","traditional Chinese medicine Xinjiaxiangruyin","clear therapeutic effect","satisfactory therapeutic effect","high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin","downregulation","Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction","infection","RT-qPCR","immunological mechanisms","myeloid differentiation primary response","nuclear factor-kappa B","receptor","damp","protective role","proportion of Th17","effects","RESULTS","T-regulatory cells","analytical method","quality control","CONCLUSION","lungs","METHODS","Flow cytometry","Western blotting","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Accordingly, a cross-sectional survey of 2768 households was conducted using a postal questionnaire. The 2006 Sydney residential phone book was used as the sampling frame. Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all \u22646 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or \u2018pet park enclosures\u2019. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors. Most owners fed their cats a combination of commercial dry and canned food (38.1%), although fresh meat was popular also and either fed alone (1.6%) or in combination with dry food (14.4%), tinned food (1.6%) or canned and dry food (25.8%). A diet consisting of dry food alone was fed to cats in 13.4% of households. Ninety percent of cats had been vaccinated at least once, while 72.2% received a vaccination in the last 3 years. Older cats were less likely to have been vaccinated recently than younger cats. Only 5.8% of cats had never visited a veterinarian. For the 243 cats that had received veterinary attention, the average number of years since the last visit was 1.5.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toribio, Jenny-Ann L.M.; Norris, Jacqueline M.; White, Joanna D.; Dhand, Nanveet K.; Hamilton, Samuel A.; Malik, Richard","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca2cd5d8b0aea69a1474cd370f3ced9aaa189c2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130031.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X08002052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070524/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2008.06.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X08002052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sydney"],"keyphrases":["pet cats","Older cats","male cats","percent of cats","younger cats","domestic crossbred cats","median age of pedigree cats","households","dry food","average number of years","canned food","tinned food","popular pets","combination of commercial dry","distribution of cat ownership","veterinary attention","diet","mean age","vaccination","common breed","Sydney residential phone book","non-uniform","Non-responders","postal questionnaire","pet park enclosures\u2019","reproductive status","gender","husbandry","housing","baseline data","range","birds","majority","ratio","sampling frame","weeks","aim","fresh meat","occasions","Burmese","Persian","cross-sectional survey","months","visit","crossbreds","posting","Fish","questionnaires","Dogs","veterinarian","respondents"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to describe the independent risk factors for hospital mortality and the treatment effect of corticosteroids among patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. METHODS: We retrospectively obtained clinical data of 155 adult patients with confirmed infection of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in 23 hospitals in Beijing, China from October 1 to December 23, 2009. Risk factors for hospital mortality were identified with multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 155 patients, 90 (58.1%) were male, and mean age was 43.0 \u00B1 18.6 years, and comorbidities were present in 81 (52.3%) patients. The most common organ dysfunctions included acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, septic shock, and acute renal failure. Oseltamivir was initiated in 125 patients (80.6%), only 16 patients received antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset. Fifty-two patients (33.5%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, with a median daily dose of 80 mg. Twenty-seven patients (17.4%) died during hospital stay. Diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 8.830, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.041 to 38.201, p = 0.004) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR 1.240, 95% CI 1.025 to 1.500, p = 0.027) were independent risk factors of hospital death, as were septic shock and altered mental status. Corticosteroids use was associated with a trend toward higher hospital mortality (OR 3.668, 95% CI 0.987 to 13.640, p = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza had relative poor outcome. The risk factors at hospitalization may help clinicians to identify the high-risk patients. In addition, corticosteroids use should not be regarded as routine pharmacologic therapy.","publish_time":"2010-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xi, Xiuming; Xu, Yuan; Jiang, Li; Li, Ang; Duan, Jie; Du, Bin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7e90855b317646bba5751946a9a5e675ea90fdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2941683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20799934/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-256","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["adult patients","Hospitalized patients","high-risk patients","H1N1 influenza","independent risk factors of hospital death","higher hospital mortality","Corticosteroids use","pandemic influenza","systemic corticosteroids","septic shock","mental status","treatment effect of corticosteroids","acute respiratory failure","acute renal failure","confirmed infection","antiviral therapy","routine pharmacologic therapy","common organ dysfunctions","hours","clinicians","trend","clinical data","median daily dose","multivariate logistic regression analysis","relative poor outcome","years","lactate dehydrogenase","level","symptom onset","mean age","LDH","hospitals","Beijing","study","virus","hospitalization","CONCLUSIONS","odds ratio","confidence interval","Diabetes","comorbidities","male","China","METHODS","addition","objective","RESULTS","Oseltamivir","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using broad based search criteria relating to coronavirus and bacterial co-infection. Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included. Data describing bacterial/fungal co-infections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-COV-2 even in the absence of co-infection was performed. RESULTS: 1007 abstracts were identified. Eighteen full texts reported bacterial/fungal co-infection were included. Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140;61%). 9/18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) MERS, and 3/18 (17%) other coronavirus. For COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection during hospital admission. Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection. On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy. No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described. For non-COVID-19 cases bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported in 89/815 (11%) of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus associated respiratory infections, there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection. Generation of prospective evidence to support development of antimicrobial policy and appropriate stewardship interventions specific for the COVID-19 pandemic are urgently required.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rawson, Timothy M; Moore, Luke S P; Zhu, Nina; Ranganathan, Nishanthy; Skolimowska, Keira; Gilchrist, Mark; Satta, Giovanni; Cooke, Graham; Holmes, Alison","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa9d8e8d38ecd3cabe34348b48c80540fe7952d3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial co-infection","coronavirus infection","absence of co-infection","fungal co-infections","bacterial coinfection","patients","cases bacterial","fungal coinfection","SARS-COV","Secondary analysis of studies","antimicrobial stewardship interventions","antimicrobial prescribing","paucity of data","antimicrobial therapy","non-COVID","development of antimicrobial policy","respiratory infections","paucity of evidence","clinical data","Broad-spectrum antibiotic use","MERS","wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials","appropriate stewardship interventions specific","frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials","Generation of prospective evidence","broad based search criteria","association","English","treatments","Web of Science","current literature","hospital admission","EMBASE","Mandarin","texts","MEDLINE","CONCLUSIONS","outcomes","Articles","METHODS","Italian","pandemic","RESULTS","abstracts","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we first describe the state of the art of medical-laboratory tests that can be performed near the patient. At present, POCT ranges from basic blood-glucose measurement to complex viscoelastic coagulation assays. POCT shortens the time to clinical decision-making about additional testing or therapy, as delays are no longer caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples, and biochemical-test results are rapidly available at the point of care. Improved medical outcome and lower costs may ensue. Recent, evolving technological advances enable the development of novel POCT instruments. We review the underlying analytical techniques. If new instruments are not yet in practical use, it is often hard to decide whether the underlying analytical principle has real advantage over former methods. However, future utilization of POCT also depends on health-care trends and new areas of application. But, even today, it can be assumed that, for certain applications, near-patient testing is a useful complement to conventional laboratory analyses.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luppa, Peter B.; M\u00FCller, Carolin; Schlichtiger, Alice; Schlebusch, Harald","journal":"TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e65248850b29893254da11cdcc1ca94c60845883.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125710.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2011.01.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165993611000860; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993611000860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care testing","POCT ranges","patient testing","clinical application","point of care","future utilization of POCT","development of novel POCT instruments","additional testing","clinical decision-making","underlying analytical principle","laboratory tests","analytical scope","underlying analytical techniques","new instruments","review","preparation of clinical samples","health-care trends","conventional laboratory analyses","new areas of application","laboratory-medicine discipline","art of medical","Abstract Point","Improved medical outcome","basic blood-glucose measurement","useful complement","biochemical-test results","real advantage","therapy","time","technological advances","viscoelastic coagulation assays","lower costs","transport","delays","present","practical use","methods","state","certain applications"],"language":"en"},

After binding to their respective IFN receptors and activation of the cellular JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascade, they stimulate the transcription of a plethora of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected as well as bystander cells such as the non-infected epithelium and cells of the immune system. ISGs may directly act on the invading pathogen or can either positively or negatively regulate the innate and adaptive immune response. However, IFNs and ISGs do not only play a key role in the limitation of pathogen spread but have also been recently found to provoke an unbalanced, overshooting inflammatory response causing tissue injury and hampering repair processes. A prominent regulator of disease outcome, especially in\u2014but not limited to\u2014respiratory viral infection, is the IFN-dependent mediator TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) produced by several cell types including immune cells such as macrophages or T cells. First described as an apoptosis-inducing agent in transformed cells, it is now also well established to rapidly evoke cellular stress pathways in epithelial cells, finally leading to caspase-dependent or -independent cell death. Hereby, pathogen spread is limited; however in some cases, also the surrounding tissue is severely harmed, thus augmenting disease severity. Interestingly, the lack of a strictly controlled and well balanced IFN/TRAIL signaling response has not only been implicated in viral infection but might furthermore be an important determinant of disease progression in bacterial superinfections and in chronic respiratory illness. Conclusively, the IFN/TRAIL signaling axis is subjected to a complex modulation and might be exploited for the evaluation of new therapeutic concepts aiming at attenuation of tissue injury.","publish_time":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peteranderl, Christin; Herold, Susanne","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/295d1050a0d5e811698a853c29cc8b388d4d92f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5360710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382038/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN/TRAIL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune cells","epithelial cells","bystander cells","T cells","transformed cells","plethora of IFN","balanced IFN","ISGs","pathogen spread","IFN-dependent mediator TRAIL","limitation of pathogen","invading pathogen","respective IFN receptors","adaptive immune response","attenuation of tissue injury","surrounding tissue","inflammatory response","immune system","disease severity","respiratory viral infection","IFNs","pathogen-associated pattern recognition","cellular JAK","caspase-dependent","important determinant of disease progression","activator of transcription","cell types","prominent regulator of disease outcome","non-infected epithelium","TNF-related apoptosis","cellular stress pathways","chronic respiratory illness","independent cell death","bacterial superinfections","signal transducer","activation","ligand","hampering repair processes","stimulated genes","macrophages","evaluation of new therapeutic concepts","cascade","axis","key role","binding","agent","complex modulation","cases","Interferons","lack"],"language":"en"},

However, infectious diseases still remain a major population health issue and this may be exacerbated by rapid urbanization and unprecedented impacts of climate change. This commentary aims to explore China\u2019s current capacity to manage infectious diseases which impair population health. It discusses the existing disease surveillance system and underscores the critical importance of strengthening the system. It also explores how the growing migrant population, dramatic changes in the natural landscape following rapid urbanization, and changing climatic conditions can contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03B1 and TNF-\u03B1) were significantly reduced within 0\u20134 h post-infection (P \u003C 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P \u003C 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P \u003C 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN-\u03B1 transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shiqin; Wu, Jiayun; Wang, Fang; Wang, Haifei; Wu, Zhengchang; Wu, Shenglong; Bao, Wenbin","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6c38211730ff7826aa6a52aff9e3be848f8e738.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7040077.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32133381/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","OAS1","Mx2 genes","inflammatory cytokines","expression of antiviral genes","entire infection","antiviral function of PKR","TNF-\u03B1","expression dynamics of antiviral genes","IFN-\u03B1 transcription","h post-infection","following PEDV stimulation","Mx1","IL","expression of RIG","intense inflammatory response","IFN-\u03B2","suckling piglets","Porcine diarrhea disease","results","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","mechanism of resistance","cellular invasion","molecular mechanism","immune response","cellular level","IPEC-J2","cells","newborn","host","important role","leading cause of economic loss","reference","relationship","pig industry","cytopathic changes","time","study"],"language":"en"},

Immune measurements included in vitro bactericidal ability of whole blood and in vivo T cell mediated response to mitogenic challenge. Bactericidal activity in T. brasiliensis varied with roosting ecology, but appears to be sensitive to colony-level effects. Blood from females living at one cave had significantly lower bactericidal ability than blood from females at three other sites. T cell mediated response in this species was associated with variation in roost ecology, with females from two caves having greater responses than females from two bridges. T cell mediated response and bactericidal activity were negatively correlated with one another within individuals that were tested for both.

This could maintain the demand for acute care within the healthcare system?s capacity to treat.3 Travel has been curtailed, conferences and concerts cancelled, and schools and universities have moved students off campus and classes online. Medical schools are following suit, with added motivators. In canceling classes and rotations, medical schools hope to: promote social distancing, limit the risk of students contracting the virus, limit the number of healthcare workers who might spread the virus to unaffected patients, minimize the teaching burden on frontline providers, and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential personnel. These are logical reasons for removing students from hospitals.

A study of monthly airfare data from 2002 to 2004 confirms that fare wars occur periodically, as well as price collusion. Both tend to be short-lived. The fact that collusion is more likely to occur in January and April when demand is high, as revealed by China Eastern\u0027s and China Southern\u0027s price-war and collusion models, has been confirmed by interview information obtained from the airlines\u0027 sales managers. However, there is also evidence in these models suggesting that collusion can be more easily formed when demand is low. High airport concentration measured by the HHI may facilitate collusion in certain circumstances, but it may also lead to more price wars under other conditions. Concentration in both airports and routes does not appear to systematically affect the occurrence of fare wars and collusion in all the models estimated.

In this study, the inactivation performance, energy utilization, and bactericidal mechanisms for microwave-irradiated airborne and waterborne Escherichia coli were compared. A Beer-Lambert law-based model was also developed and validated to compare the inactivation performance in different phases. Microwave had greater inactivation effect on airborne bacteria than waterborne bacteria. The inactivation rate constant for airborne E. coli (0.29 s\u22121) was nearly 20 times higher than that of waterborne species (0.014 s\u22121). Most of the absorbed microwave energy (92.3%) was converted to increase water temperature instead of inactivating the waterborne bacteria, because the microwave photons were easily absorbed by water molecules. By contrast, 45.4% of the absorbed energy could disinfect the airborne bacteria. Finally, the required energies for 1-log inactivation were calculated as 2.3 J and 116.9 J per log-inactivation for airborne and waterborne E. coli, respectively. The airborne and waterborne E. coli samples showed distinct microwave inactivation mechanisms. Waterborne E. coli disinfection was primarily due to thermal effect, while the non-thermal effect was the major mechanism for airborne E. coli inactivation.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Can; Hu, Xurui; Zhang, Zhiwei","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4696880723e13d0ad3c2e93ee1458567e2f97ae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226120/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850219305336; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850219305336; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2019.105437","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Waterborne E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli inactivation","airborne bacteria","waterborne bacteria","log inactivation","log-inactivation","inactivation performance","absorbed microwave energy","waterborne Escherichia coli","distinct microwave inactivation mechanisms","greater inactivation effect","microwave photons","waterborne species","Abstract Microwave","absorbed energy","coli samples","coli disinfection","energy efficiency","energy utilization","inactivation rate constant","non-thermal effect","bactericidal mechanisms","utilization pathway","different media","different phases","water temperature","water molecules","major mechanism","limiting factor","Beer-Lambert law-based model","liquids","food","environmental application","times higher","required energies","study","microorganisms","surfaces","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig.

A reliable serological assay for evaluating the PEDV-specific humoral and mucosal immune response is important for disease survey, monitoring the efficacy of immunization, and designing strategies for the prevention and control of PED. Two PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed using G2b PEDV-Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) trimeric full-length S and truncated S(1\u2013501) proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression system. The truncated S(1\u2013501) protein was selected from a superior expressed stable cell line. The sensitivity and specificity of these two ELISAs were compared to immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells and to a commercial nucleocapsid (N)-based indirect ELISA kit using a panel of PEDV negative and hyperimmune sera. RESULTS: The commercial N-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 37%, a specificity of 100%, and a fair agreement (kappa = 0.37) with the immunostaining result. In comparison, the full-length S-based ELISA showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 94%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.90) with the immunostaining result. Interestingly, the S(1\u2013501)-based ELISA had even higher sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 99.1%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.97) with the immunostaining result. A fair agreement (kappa\u003C 0.4) was seen between the commercial N-based ELISA and either of our S-based ELISAs. However, the results of the full-length S-based ELISA shared an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92) with that of S(1\u2013501)-based ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Both full-length S-based and S(1\u2013501)-based ELISAs exhibit high sensitivity and high specificity for detecting antibodies against PEDVs. Considering the high protein yield and cost-effectiveness, the S(1\u2013501)-based ELISA could be used as a reliable, sensitive, specific, and economic serological test for PEDV.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chia-Yu; Peng, Ju-Yi; Cheng, Yun-Han; Chang, Yen-Chen; Wu, Yen-Tse; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Chiou, Hue-Ying; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Chang, Hui-Wen","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d36857d0cdaff4320e21e718bdc2e12599ef124.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6880432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775769/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2171-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-based ELISAs","full-length S-based ELISA","truncated S","commercial N-based ELISA","trimeric full-length S","kappa","PEDV spike","high sensitivity","high specificity","perfect agreement","PEDV-specific humoral","G2b PEDV-Pintung","indirect ELISA kit","fair agreement","immunostaining result","panel of PEDV negative","immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells","higher sensitivity","high mortality","high protein yield","commercial nucleocapsid","RESULTS","reliable serological assay","economic serological test","cell expression system","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","superior expressed stable cell line","mucosal immune response","disease survey","HEK","glycoprotein","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","devastating impacts","neonatal piglets","human embryonic kidney","strategies","swine industry","hyperimmune sera","proteins","cost-effectiveness","antibodies","efficacy of immunization","outbreaks of genotype","prevention","PEDVs","comparison","control of PED","countries","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

AIM: The purpose of this work was to investigate intestinal and peripheral expression of FGL2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). METHODS: FGL2 expression in mucosal biopsies from three groups (UC group (n = 61), CD group (n = 54), and controls group (n = 35)) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Concentrations of FGL2 in plasma from 50 UC patients, 45 CD patients, and 30 controls were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot of FGL2 protein and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR of FGL2 mRNA expression by peripheral mononuclear cells was performed. Correlations of FGL2 expression with disease type, activity, and location, and with measured laboratory data, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were examined. RESULTS: Intestinal and peripheral FGL2 protein data showed that FGL2 expression was significantly up-regulated in both UC and CD patients compared with controls (P \u003C 0.001). Expression of FGL2 was higher in UC and CD patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P \u003C 0.001). Moreover, FGL2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P \u003C 0.050). Expression of FGL2 protein was correlated with disease activity indices, CRP levels, and ESR levels. CONCLUSION: Expression of FGL2 was up-regulated in IBD patients with active disease. Measurement of FGL2 may be used as a helpful biomarker for understanding immunopathogenesis and for assessment of IBD.","publish_time":"2013-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Xiuli; Ye, Xiaohua; Chen, Xiangrong; Chen, Tanzhou; Xie, Saili; Li, Qinfan; Lin, Xiaoxiao; Huang, Zhiming","journal":"Dig Dis Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d3fec32bbc22df9abff1149c1c43e17f71095cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087870.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287641/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-013-2962-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESR","IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Expression of FGL2 protein","peripheral expression of FGL2","Correlations of FGL2 expression","Concentrations of FGL2","Measurement of FGL2","peripheral FGL2 protein data","UC patients","CD patients","inactive disease","Western blot of FGL2 protein","disease type","Crohn\u2019s disease","IBD patients","real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR of FGL2 mRNA expression","disease activity indices","UC group","CD group","inflammatory bowel disease","controls group","C-reactive protein","CRP levels","ESR levels","assessment of IBD","Fibrinogen","peripheral mononuclear cells","measured laboratory data","mucosal biopsies","location","groups","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","ulcerative colitis","immunopathogenesis","work","METHODS","plasma","RESULTS","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","new member","helpful biomarker","novel immunosuppressive molecule","AIM","purpose","family","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","immunohistochemistry"],"language":"en"},

This report hypothesizes the possible implication of an autoimmune response, induced by generation of allo- or autoantibodies to ACE-2, or to its complexes with viral spike protein.

In South Korea, PGAR is prevalent in piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Piglets naturally co-infected with PEDV and PGAR appeared to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that was distinct from that commonly observed. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PGAR co-infection on PEDV pathogenicity in piglets. Thirty-six colostrum-deprived, one-day old, Large White-Duroc crossbred pigs were randomly divided into four equal groups: PEDV, PEDV/PGAR, PGAR, and control groups. The piglets were euthanized at 1, 2, or 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) to measure the villous height:crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio and to collect fecal samples for RT-PCR and virus isolation. No significant differences in mean VH:CD ratio and clinical symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia) were observed between the PEDV/PGAR-infected and PEDV-infected groups of piglets at 1, 2 and 3 DPI; however, at 2 and 3 DPI, PGAR was detected in all fecal samples by RT-PCR and virus isolation. These findings failed to detect any interaction between PEDV and porcine rotavirus in the small intestines of piglets, suggesting that concurrent infection of PGAR may not synergistically enhance intestinal villous atrophy of piglets with PEDV disease. We propose that the severe diarrhea exhibited in PEDV and PGAR co-infected piglets may be more associated with the immunity level of the host rather than to any synergistic effect of PGAR on PEDV enteritis.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Song, Dae-Sub","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ccefcd9e0eae0cb8dfbbf98a820b7b7d0f0fef3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111867.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528807001828; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528807001828","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PGAR"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["PGAR-infected","PEDV-infected groups of piglets","PGAR co-infected piglets","PEDV pathogenicity","PEDV enteritis","PEDV disease","concurrent infection of PGAR","synergistic effect of PGAR","impact of PGAR co-infection","small intestines of piglets","severe diarrhea","intestinal villous atrophy of piglets","prolonged diarrhea","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine rotavirus","virus isolation","CD ratio","porcine group","RT-PCR","fecal samples","equal groups","control groups","main causative agents of acute diarrhea","mean VH","villous height","clinical symptoms","Large White-Duroc crossbred pigs","crypt depth","day old","significant differences","host","interaction","South Korea","immunity level","dehydration","days post-inoculation","study","anorexia","aim","colostrum","findings"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of na\u00EFve animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission.","publish_time":"2019-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adney, Danielle R.; Wang, Lingshu; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Shi, Wei; Zhang, Yi; Kong, Wing-Pui; Miller, Megan R.; Bushmaker, Trenton; Scott, Dana; de Wit, Emmie; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Graham, Barney S.; Bowen, Richard A.; Munster, Vincent J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8198cb2eac9d910c4f14712025d90ddb958204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466352.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Africa"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV disease","upper airways of dromedary camels","nasal turbinates of dromedary camels","reduced shedding","ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak","delayed viral shedding","zoonotic transmission chain","risk of zoonotic transmission","adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine","primary zoonotic reservoir","Lower titers of serum","complete protection","alpaca correlates","high serum","antibody titers","vaccination of na\u00EFve animals","induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses","results","antibodies","Middle East","human infections","humans","data","effective strategy","Africa","Interruption"],"language":"en"},

Although health care workers (HCWs) are essential to the health system response, there are few studies exploring HCW attitudes to pandemic influenza. The aim of this study was to explore HCWs knowledge, attitudes and intended behaviour towards pandemic influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional investigation of a convenience sample of clinical and non-clinical HCWs from two tertiary-referral teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia was conducted between June 4 and October 19, 2007. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed to hospital personal from 40 different wards and departments. The main outcome measures were intentions regarding work attendance and quarantine, antiviral use and perceived preparation. RESULTS: Respondents were categorized into four main groups by occupation: Nursing (47.5%), Medical (26.0%), Allied (15.3%) and Ancillary (11.2%). Our study found that most HCWs perceived pandemic influenza to be very serious (80.9%, n = 873) but less than half were able to correctly define it (43.9%, n = 473). Only 24.8% of respondents believed their department to be prepared for a pandemic, but nonetheless most were willing to work during a pandemic if a patient or colleague had influenza. The main determinants of variation in our study were occupational factors, demographics and health beliefs. Non-clinical staff were significantly most likely to be unsure of their intentions (OR 1.43, p \u003C 0.001). Only 42.5% (n = 459) of respondents considered that neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications (oseltamivir/zanamivir) would protect them against pandemic influenza, whereas 77.5% (n = 836) believed that vaccination would be of benefit. CONCLUSION: We identified two issues that could undermine the best of pandemic plans \u2013 the first, a low level of confidence in antivirals as an effective measure; secondly, that non-clinical workers are an overlooked group whose lack of knowledge and awareness could undermine pandemic plans. Other issues included a high level of confidence in dietary measures to protect against influenza, and a belief among ancillary workers that antibiotics would be protective. All health care worker strategies should include non clinical and ancillary staff to ensure adequate business continuity for hospitals. HCW education, psychosocial support and staff communication could improve knowledge of appropriate pandemic interventions and confidence in antivirals.","publish_time":"2009-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seale, Holly; Leask, Julie; Po, Kieren; MacIntyre, C Raina","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aec5514aada77bb18c23a36f314ce949ba0ff846.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2661074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216792/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","best of pandemic plans","non-clinical HCWs","knowledge of appropriate pandemic interventions","Non-clinical staff","non-clinical workers","HCWs knowledge","ancillary staff","ancillary workers","health care workers","study","Respondents","health beliefs","convenience sample of clinical","lack of knowledge","staff communication","high level of confidence","intentions","low level of confidence","antivirals","HCW attitudes","main outcome measures","health care worker strategies","main groups","health system response","hospitals","issues","main determinants of variation","antiviral use","work attendance","dietary measures","HCW education","perceived preparation","neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications","quarantine","overlooked group","occupational factors","tertiary-referral","studies","intended behaviour","hospital personal","psychosocial support","adequate business continuity","oseltamivir","demographics","zanamivir","awareness","Cross-sectional investigation","general consensus","effective measure","different wards","Sydney","Nursing","antibiotics","self-administered questionnaire","departments","METHODS","Australia","colleague","patient","BACKGROUND","vaccination","half","benefit","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","aim"],"language":"en"},

The events that follow virus\u2013receptor binding and eventually lead to virus entry are poorly understood. We studied the possible effects of MHV infection on intracellular calcium in a mouse astrocytoma cell line. Using the calcium-sensitive dye fluo-3 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that MHV strain JHM induced an immediate (within 20 s) and transient (lasting no longer than 2 min) calcium increase in about 5% of the infected cells. The calcium increase was blocked by antibodies against the viral spike protein, suggesting that it was specifically triggered by the interaction of the viral spikes with cells. It was also inhibited by L-type calcium channel blockers and was not detected in calcium-free medium, suggesting that the calcium increase was caused by calcium influx from the extracellular medium. Studies of the kinetics of viral replication by immunofluorescence staining of the viral nucleocapsid protein revealed that at 3 h postinfection there was roughly the same percentage of cells (5%) that produced the viral protein as the percentage of cells that had responded with a calcium signal. This finding and the virus dilution studies together suggest that calcium responders may represent cells that had been infected with multiple viruses and undergone rapid viral replication. Furthermore, calcium channel blockers, including verapamil and cadmium chloride, and the calcium chelator EGTA inhibited virus infection. Therefore, the transient intracellular calcium increase reported here may be an early signaling event associated with virus infection.","publish_time":"1997-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraeft, Stine-Kathrein; Chen, Daniel S.; Li, Hsin-Pai; Chen, Lan Bo; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/856f85d3ac19c7b58c6a8bccc21fbbb80b325c34.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001448279793768X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001448279793768X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calcium influx","calcium responders","calcium signal","calcium-free medium","transient intracellular calcium increase","viral protein","type calcium channel blockers","calcium chelator EGTA inhibited virus infection","calcium-sensitive dye fluo","viral spikes","virus entry","percentage of cells","infected cells","viral nucleocapsid protein","viral spike protein","kinetics of viral replication","rapid viral replication","virus dilution studies","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","possible effects of MHV infection","MHV strain JHM","murine coronavirus","extracellular medium","murine carcinoembryonic antigens","mouse astrocytoma cell line","immunofluorescence staining","cadmium chloride","confocal laser scanning microscopy","verapamil","antibodies","multiple viruses","receptor binding","receptors","h postinfection","events","interaction"],"language":"en"},

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore has routinely fit-tested staff for high filtration N95 respirators, and established web-based staff surveillance systems. The routine systems were enhanced in response to Singapore\u2019s first imported COVID-19 case on January 23,2020. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, from January 23,2020 to February 23,2020, among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital co-located with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of February 23,2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multi-pronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures:(1) Risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) Staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) Enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff. RESULTS: A total of 10,583 staff were placed on hospital-wide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1,524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of eight staff illness episodes was seen per day, and almost 10% (n=29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Htun, Htet Lin; Lim, Dwee Wee; Kyaw, Win Mar; Loh, Wan-Ning Janis; Lee, Lay Tin; Ang, Brenda; Chow, Angela","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49bf3476f3fe1f430e72cc15a15c07915f1b8feb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["frontline staff","Staff fever","monitor staff","medical surveillance of unwell staff","robust staff protection","fit-tested staff","staff illness episodes","sickness surveillance","established web-based staff surveillance systems","surveillance strategy","close surveillance","imported COVID","confirmed COVID","potential COVID","health surveillance system","TTSH","hospital-wide fever","Coronavirus disease","NCID","bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital co-","Tan Tock Seng Hospital","emerging infectious disease","non-outbreak periods","novel coronavirus","Infectious Diseases","SARS-CoV","routine systems","bed National Centre","severe acute respiratory syndrome","high filtration N95 respirators","response","Singapore\u2019s","effectiveness","median","multi-pronged approach","Risk","personal protective equipment","exposures","areas","day","cases","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","cross-sectional study","healthcare workers","RESULTS","total","infection","Wuhan","China","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory virus in upper and/or lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT) specimens were tested using Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay. Seventy-nine consecutive allo-HSCT recipients developed a total of 192 virologically documented RVI episodes over 30 months. The median follow-up after RVI was 388 days (range, 5 to 923).

Fourteen CoV RVI episodes were limited to the URT, whereas 7 affected the LRT. Co-pathogens were detected in 8 (38%) CoV cases. Type OC43 CoV was the dominant type (48%) followed by NL63 (24%), KHU1 (19%), and 229E (9%); the CoV hospitalization rate was 19%, whereas mortality was 5% (1 patient without any other microbiologic documentation).

In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death. In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al 2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown intervention covariate.

We find that municipalities with a higher number of cases at the beginning of the period analyzed have a lower rate of diffusion, which cannot be imputed to herd immunity. In particular, there is a robust and strongly significant negative correlation between the estimated basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the initial outbreak size, in contrast with the role of $R_0$ as a \\emph{predictor} of outbreak size. We explore different possible explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that a higher number of cases causes changes of behavior, such as a more strict adoption of social distancing measures among the population, that reduce the spread.

Here, we show that human SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and 2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong. Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans.

This article proposes a time dynamic prediction model with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple tool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to implement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can increase or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum daily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the disease can minimize death rate.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Min; Ishwaran, Hemant","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f1fdd6ff4e43577e02e00383690886f7292e4be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13997v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["adaptive containment strategy","adaptive containment strategies","constant containment strategy","types of containment strategies","strictest containment measures","different strategies","infected cases","effective treatments","mortality rate","different treatments","emergence of coronavirus disease","death rate","effective treatment plan","initial infectious cases","infected individual","maximum daily number of cases","time dynamic prediction model","competing risks","outbreak length","strict level changes","simple tool","policy makers","local governments","goal","engagement","population","research","United States","clinical community","article","COVID","needs of citizens","new drug","terms","long period","dynamics","pandemic scenario","region","illustration","severity","situation","results"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after clinical trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school closure, and quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit the spread of the disease and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate information. To update the public, especially in South Africa, announcements are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases, mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying publicly available data in a way that is computer-readable so that information can be shared to the public - using both a data repository and a dashboard. Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to publicly available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include shortcomings in the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices between governmental departments and the South African public. In this paper, solutions to these problems will be shared by using a publicly available data repository and dashboard as a case study.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marivate, Vukosi; Combrink, Herkulaas MvE","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a102c54ce239b21b2b2ced7fb340c6c2d6c4917.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04813v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["Data Science","nuanced data","available data repository","data management practices","South African public","daily announcements","daily infographic","South African National Institute","cases","dashboard","accurate information","regions","coronavirus disease","confirmed COVID","collaborative practices","updated infographic","minister of health","travel history of people","Social distancing measures","World Health Organization","Social Impact research group","Communicable Diseases","governmental departments","University of Pretoria","gender","integrity","limited access","number of tests","variety of challenges","individuals","pandemic","quarantine","school closure","demand","accessibility","way","curating","mortality rate","computer-readable","case study","countries","patient","transmission","seclusion of groups","healthcare infrastructure","treatments","paper","solutions","problems","SARS-CoV","shortcomings","spread","fore","clinical trials","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Using the training sequences as well as the test sequence consisting of a single-change and allowing for the erasure or rejection option, we derive the optimal resolution between the estimated and true change-points under two different asymptotic regimes on the undetected error probability---namely, the large and moderate deviations regimes.

Studying patient flow in a hospital is particularly fundamental as it demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of a hospital. Since hospital is a collection of physically nearby services under one administration, its performance and outcome are shaped by the interaction of its discrete components. Coordination of processes at different levels of organizational structure of a hospital can be studied using network analysis. Hence, this article presents a data-driven static and temporal network of departments. Both networks are directed and weighted and constructed using seven years\u0027 (2010-2016) empirical data of 24902 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The ties reflect an episode-based transfer of ACS patients from department to department in a hospital. The weight represents the number of patients transferred among departments. As a result, the underlying structure of a network of departments that deliver healthcare for ACS patients is described, the main departments and their role in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients are identified, the role of departments over seven years is analyzed and communities of departments are discovered. The results of this study may help hospital administration to effectively organize and manage the coordination of departments based on their significance, strategic positioning and role in the diagnosis and treatment process which, in turn, nurtures value-based and precision healthcare.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abuhay, Tesfamariam M; Getinet, Yemisrach G; Metsker, Oleg G; Yakovlev, Alexey N; Kovalchuk, Sergey V","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67c68c3429a80a2b8563d7b01f4eecfa2652fa2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09290v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","ACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of departments","coordination of departments","main departments","communities of departments","hospital administration","temporal network of departments","treatment process of ACS patients","number of patients","episode-based transfer of ACS patients","diagnosis","precision healthcare","network analysis","Healthcare systems","empirical data","underlying structure","Coordination of processes","different levels of organizational structure","Acute Coronary Syndrome","significance","nurtures value","strategic positioning","nearby services","turn","interaction","outcome","performance","effectiveness","efficiency","collection","study","patient flow","discrete components","efficient care","years\u0027","article","weight","results","networks"],"language":"en"},

Similar models are also proposed to describe the spread of riots and, more generally, of collective behaviors in various social contexts. The use of epidemiology models to describe such social phenomena is based on the analogy between the mechanisms of contagion and social imitation. In turn, this analogy also points to the social nature of epidemics. This paper is concerned with a family of Reaction-Diffusion systems introduced in [17] that aims at unifying, generalizing, and enlarging the fields of application for epidemiology and collective behavior models. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach on these apparently various phenomena through the example of the dynamics of social unrest. The model involves two quantities, the level of social unrest, or, more general, activity u, and a field of social tension v, which play asymmetric roles: u is thought of as the actual observed or explicit quantity while v is an ambiant, sometimes implicit field of susceptibility that modulates the growth of u. In this article, we explore this class of model and prove several theoretical results based on the framework developed in [17], of which the present work is a companion paper. Here we place the emphasis on two subclasses of systems defined in [17]: tension inhibiting and tension enhancing. These are characterized by the fact that the unrest has respectively a negative or positive feedback on the social tension (though no monotonicity condition is assumed). In [17] we derive a threshold phenomenon in terms of the initial level of social tension: below a critical value, a small triggering event is quickly followed by a resumption of calm, while, above this value, it generates an eruption of social unrest spreading through space with an asymptotically constant speed. The new results we derive in the present paper concern the behavior of the solution far from the propagating edge, that is, we give a description of the new regime of the system following the initial surge of activity. We show in particular that the model can give rise to many diverse qualitative dynamics: ephemeral or limited-duration social movements-referred to as\u0022riots\u0022-in the tension inhibiting case, and persisting social movements-lasting upheavals-in the tension enhancing case, as well as other more complex behaviors in some mixed cases. We also investigate this model by numerical simulations that highlight the richness of this framework. We finally propose and study extensions of the model, such as spatially heterogeneous systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berestycki, Henri; Nordmann, Samuel; Rossi, Luca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1eef3afe018211c6001b20966f6817945c3b802.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09865v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social phenomena","social imitation","dynamics of social unrest","level of social unrest","field of social tension v","initial level of social tension","eruption of social unrest","various social contexts","duration social movements","social nature of epidemics","social movements-lasting upheavals","class of model","present paper","SI epidemiology models","collective behavior models","use of epidemiology models","companion paper","Similar models","various phenomena","collective behaviors","analogy","activity u","new results","Diffusion systems","subclasses of systems","heterogeneous systems","framework","initial surge of activity","critical value","complex behaviors","present work","theoretical results","new regime","spread of riots","diverse qualitative dynamics","implicit field of susceptibility","ambiant","rise","space","terms","example","analysis of variants","small triggering event","asymmetric roles","positive feedback","introduction","explicit quantity","actual","solution","mechanisms of contagion","modeling approach","fields of application","quantities","threshold phenomenon","family of Reaction","richness","mixed cases","growth of","numerical simulations","monotonicity condition","considerable literature","propagating edge","article","constant speed","resumption of calm","description","emphasis","study extensions","turn","fact","unifying"],"language":"en"},

Next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be\u0022super-spreaders.\u0022Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it.

By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chin, Wei Chien Benny; Bouffanais, Roland","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19b2cba5eacb9715e419d94e79f64e03e1cc912c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05063v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spatial super-spreaders","super-susceptible locations","people","novel concept of super-susceptibles","riskier places","urban planning","systematic framework","useful framework","proposed data-analytic framework","certain places","Singapore","governments","central train stations","teeming bus interchanges","dense urban environments","major urban center","busy peripheral bus interchanges","public transportation","daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport","particular locations","cluster of disease","human flow intensity","cost-effective preventive measures","central business district","bustling train station","weighted human movement networks","strict social distancing measures","capacity","neighborhood diversity metrics","epidemiological preparedness","close attention","practical guidelines","suburbs","lockdowns","stay-at-home orders","economies","analysis","results","globe"],"language":"en"},

Part 1: Evidence","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"arxiv","abstract":"In the wake of the influenza pandemic of 1889-1890 Jacques Bertillon, a pioneer of medical statistics, noticed that after the massive death spike there was a dip in birth numbers around 9 months later which was significantly larger than that which could be explained by the population change as a result of excess deaths. In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that behind the random appearance of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact hidden explanatory factors.","publish_time":"2018-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richmond, Peter; Roehner, Bertrand M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37859ff3d00e30984b8774c65fd4b000740365a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04533v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jacques Bertillon"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["death-birth coupling phenomenon","birth numbers","new cases of massive death spikes","largest death spikes","birth rates of heat waves","wake","extra dip","months","random appearance of birth rate fluctuations","Jacques Bertillon","present coupling leads","recent influenza pandemics","better understanding","impact","Tokyo","pioneer of medical statistics","pivotal role of collateral sufferers","Twin Tower attack","disparity","earthquakes","predictions","births","instance","result of excess deaths","explanatory factors","unified way effects","population","events","spite","section","observation","time","aim","addition"],"language":"en"},

Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49 million workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model suggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half, they need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in communication. Retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools are the most affected sectors.

Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people between regions--and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friston, Karl J.; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J.; Billig, Alexander J.; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Cathy J.; Moran, Rosalyn J.; Lambert, Christian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c64394abb5e97b4efcb57c18e8e649b869a61bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13017v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["United States","epidemiological model","outbreak","model of viral spread","loss of immunity","Bayesian model reduction","dynamic causal model","regions","modelling","timeseries of new cases","wave of new cases","soft social distancing strategies","terms of mortality","mortality rates","different strategic responses","likely outcomes of different policies","ensuing posterior parameter estimates","COVID","deaths","return","key factors","pandemic","factorial","parameters","prevalence of infection","effective connectivity","initial phases","lockdown","days","endemic equilibrium","single region","exchange of people","provisional results","critical care","models","population","epidemic","focus"],"language":"en"},

Covid-19 attacks not only the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other vital organs of the body, with possible sequela. At present, the detection of COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). However, many countries are in the outbreak period of the epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited. They cannot provide sufficient numbers of gene sequence detection, and many patients may not be isolated and treated in time. Given this situation, we researched the analytical and diagnostic capabilities of deep learning on chest radiographs and proposed Cascade-SEMEnet which is cascaded with SEME-ResNet50 and SEME-DenseNet169. The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to enhance the data. We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. Then we used SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and determined if it is caused by COVID-19. To exclude the influence of non-pathological features on the network, we preprocessed the data with U-Net during the training of SEME-DenseNet169. The results showed that our network achieved an accuracy of 85.6\\% in determining the type of pneumonia infection and 97.1\\% in the fine-grained classification of COVID-19.

This paper introduces an operator R that extracts a set of 2^{N-1} element Boolean lattices from a 2^N element Boolean lattice.

A second operator, which is a special case of a\u0022difference operator\u0022, is introduced that operates on consecutive Boolean lattices L_2^n and L_2^{n-1} to produce a sequence of orthocomplemented lattices. These two sequences, together with the subset ordering relation, form a primorial lattice P. A logic or probability constructed on a Boolean lattice L_2^N likewise induces a primorial lattice P.

To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations.

Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zhanshan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cda048d50c1e093a9c5c6f126836a7e12a14eb7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03714v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hubbell"],"organizations":["SARS","TPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection level","cumulative infections","lower infection threshold","approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections","SARS outbreaks","TPL parameter","COVID","M0","infection critical threshold","daily incremental infections","TPL-b","TPL analysis","relative significance of infection","lower lethality","virus kinds","spatiotemporal heterogeneity","public-health interventions","space","novel coronavirus","time","unified neutral theory of biodiversity","lower fatality rates","stability scaling parameter","specific heterogeneity","Poisson distribution","spatiotemporal fluctuations","uniform distribution","unstable outbreaks","hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model","HDP-MSN model","level of Allee effects","metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing","local contagion","Hubbell","regions","survival","quarantines","Taylor power law","coronaviruses","disease-stages","Harris","migration","epidemiological characteristics","mobility control","parameters","theta","pathogen"],"language":"en"},

The assertion of a universal power law is controversial because the linearity and slope appear to vary over time and among countries. We compare census enumerations and night light luminance as proxies for population density and intensity of development in the contiguous United States. Treating population density and development intensity as continuous quantities allows for the definition of spatial networks based on the level of spatial connectivity. The resulting distributions of spatial network components (subsets of connected nodes) vary with degree of connectivity, but maintain consistent scaling over a wide range of network sizes. At continental scales, spatial network rank-size distributions obtained from both population density and night light brightness are well-fit by power laws with exponents near -1 for a wide range of density and luminance thresholds. However, the largest components (10,000 - 100,000 sq.km) are far larger than individual cities and represent spatially contiguous agglomerations of urban, suburban and periurban development. Projecting county-level numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for the US onto spatial networks of population and development allows the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic to be quantified as propagation within networks of varying connectivity..

Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called\u0022flatten-the-curve\u0022. There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heider, Philipp","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/716c2dd87b6cab56921724b7cdea183d90a282fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05249v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pandemic models","spread of COVID","growth-models","spread of diseases","multivariable models","quality","order","scope","subexponential growth","various simulations","epidemics","creation of subexponential","underlying data","associated real data","presented modelling study","reproduction numbers","good framework","responsible viral pathogen","countermeasures","transmission rates","China","SARS-CoV","current public health dogma","value of used parameters","primary atypical pneumonia","Past studies","methodology","possibilities","improvement","selection","patients","Wuhan","ways","addition","reality","timeliness","European perspective","course","factors","paper","crisis","world","virus","Decisions","results","curve"],"language":"en"},

To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.

Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August 2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days. This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if the periods of no-isolation days are shortened.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morato, Marcelo Menezes; Bastos, Saulo Benchimol; Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira; Normey-Rico, Julio Elias","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8424c85f9528b35c690cbb4d3a7a974e6ccac893.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10797v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Model Predictive Control"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of social distance policy","control framework","duration of social distancing policies","Model Predictive Control","SIR model","optimal control policy","public social distance measures","absence of vaccines","available data","Brazilian data","beginning","absence of mass tests","inconsistent-data conditions","decision variable","asymptomatic individuals","speed of COVID","global COVID","health system","small periods","isolation days","number of infected individuals","dwell-time constraint","defining health crisis","present simulation results","additional dynamic state variable","relevant presence","virus","deaths","sub-notification","response","saturation","MPC","government","existence","mixed-logical formalism","SARS-CoV","pandemic","spread","uncertainty","population","Squares criterion","harsh shifting","century","versions","world solution","states","forecast","date","transmission","drugs","context","variations","peak of infections","relaxations","paradigm"],"language":"en"},

The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the tried-and-true polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but PCR is a laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in short supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection segmentation, is thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in medical imaging. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for quick deployment and development of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods, especially for image segmentation, are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg with traditional methods. Code and models will be released to promote the research and practical deployment for computer-aided COVID-19 screening.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Yu; Liu, Yun; Xu, Jing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb34b5fcdfe317e8787349dd7a7286117850c218.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09750v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["computer-aided COVID","efficient COVID","comprehensive COVID","private COVID","available COVID","traditional segmentation methods","traditional methods","overfitting of traditional deep learning methods","Deep learning based computer-aided screening","MiniSeg","segmentation benchmark","image segmentation","infection segmentation","lightweight deep learning model","training data","practical deployment","screening systems","development of computer","quick deployment","PCR","data-hungry","fast training","millions of parameters","low computational cost","high computational efficiency","testing","complicated manual process","new pandemic","coronavirus disease","true polymerase chain reaction","great successes","short supply","rapid spread","significant strengths","medical imaging","hand","gold standard","diagnosis","research","users","addition","global health","Code","models","performance","problems"],"language":"en"},

Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the input is a quantitative readout from each test, and the output is a list of viral loads for each sample. While other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry obtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing. When testing $n$ samples with $t$ tests, as many as $k= O(t / \\log n)$ infected samples can be identified at clinically-acceptable false positive and false negative rates. This makes Tapestry viable even at prevalence rates as high as 10\\%. Tapestry has been validated in simulations as well as in wet lab experiments with oligomers.

We use the model to make predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country as well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this total.

We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p\u003C0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kantor, B.

We sought to provide descriptive statistics for stroke and ACS from a sample of hospitals throughout the United States, comparing data from March 2020 to similar months pre-COVID. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 65 academic and community hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Data Base. The primary outcome is monthly count of stroke and ACS, and acute procedures for both, from February and March in 2020 compared to the same months in 2018 and 2019. Results are aggregated for all hospitals and reported by Census Region. Results We identified 51,246 strokes (42,780 ischemic, 8,466 hemorrhagic), 1,043 mechanical thrombectomies (MT), 836 tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administrations, 36,551 ACS, and 3,925 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for ACS. In February 2020, relative to February 2018 and 2019, hospitalizations with any discharge diagnosis of stroke and ACS increased by 9.8% and 12.1%, respectively, while in March 2020 they decreased 18.5% and 7.5%, relative to March 2018 and 2019. When only including hospitalizations with the primary discharge diagnosis of stroke or ACS, in March 2020 they decreased 17.6% and 25.7%, respectively. In March 2020, tPA decreased 3.3%, MT increased 18.8%, although in February 2020 it had increased 36.8%, and PCI decreased 14.7%. These decreases were observed in all Census regions. Conclusions Following greater recognition of the risks of COVID-19, hospitalizations with stroke and ACS were markedly diminished in a geographically diverse sample of United States hospitals. Because the most likely explanation is that some patients with stroke and ACS did not seek medical care, the underlying reasons for this decrease warrant additional study to inform public health efforts and clinical care during this and future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Havenon, A.; Ney, J.; Callaghan, B.; Delic, A.; Hohmann, S.; Shippey, E.; Yaghi, S.; Anadani, M.; Esper, G.; Majersik, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f85d6dd7ca00ec35e4508340b6745c511d19076a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20083386v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","Census Region","PCI"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["ACS","primary discharge diagnosis of stroke","monthly count of stroke","sample of hospitals","hospitalizations","community hospitals","diverse sample of United States hospitals","clinical care","risks of COVID","MT","tPA","PCI","Results","similar months pre-COVID","acute coronary syndrome","Vizient Clinical Data Base","medical care","primary outcome","acute procedures","Census regions","percutaneous coronary interventions","additional study","public health efforts","underlying reasons","tissue plasminogen activator","administrations","retrospective analysis","emergence of coronavirus disease","greater recognition","early reports","patients","mechanical thrombectomies","Background","Conclusions","future pandemics","descriptive statistics","likely explanation","strokes","Methods","decreases"],"language":"en"},

With the vaccine approval likely more than a year away and novel drugs in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. A potential drug discussed both in geopolitical and global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We intend to systematically weigh and analyze the existing evidence of HCQ in the light of published and pre-print data available so far. Methods: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases and official clinical trial Registries of the United States, China, WHO ICTRP were electronically searched for studies for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19. Pre-proof article repositories like MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv were also included in the search. The literature was critically appraised. Results: Total 71 articles were available as of 15 th April of which articles of relevance (three invitro studies, two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one follow-up study, three reviews, ten short communications) and 88 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed. HCQ seems to be efficient in inhibiting of SARS CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines; there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. Conclusions: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Currently literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of HCQ in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

Methods Pa-COVID-19 is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. We collect data on epidemiology, demography, medical history, symptoms, clinical course, pathogen testing and treatment. Systematic, serial blood sampling will allow deep molecular and immunological phenotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and comprehensive biobanking. Longitudinal data and sample collection during hospitalization will be supplemented by long-term follow-up.

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19, acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization. Methods Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed. Results Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified. Conclusions The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are required to formally test the dosing, safety, and efficacy of dornase alfa in COVID-19, and two have recently been registered (NCT04359654 and NCT04355364). With this case series, we hope to contribute to the development of management approaches for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, A.

Summary The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country. Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease. Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present. Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19. In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management. This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus. Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources. The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohnleiter, Thomas; Piot, Luc; Rogenmuser, Agathe; Noirclerc, Monique; Hamlaoui, Rabah; Grandgirard, Alain","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c8d23a54f779064b87e4e8aa6ee39b28dbef6f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1278321820300974; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1278321820300974?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mulhouse","France"],"keyphrases":["to the number","the disease","protection des patients","Summary The COVID","cancer patients","patients atteints","anticipating the risk","the patient circuit","spreading the virus","In the radiotherapy department","patients suspected","patients treated","patients trait\u00E9s","the outbreak in our city","to adapt to the epidemic in our department","The ability to perform diagnostic tests in","d\u00E9tection des patients suspects","allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments","patients undergoing treatment","care while limiting the risk","which began at the beginning","measures regarding the quality management","patients develops benign symptoms","Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity","suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures","outbreak grows exponentially in our country","at risk","service de radioth\u00E9rapie","protection des personnels m\u00E9dicaux","death from COVID","considering our material resources","tests de diagnostic","Radiotherapy centres","their management","potentiel de contamination","SARS","risque de diffusion","organisation du syst\u00E8me qualit\u00E9 du service","virus responsable","risque de d\u00E9c\u00E8s","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","r\u00E9organisation du circuit patient","potential contamination place","Mulhouse hospital","paramedical staff","r\u00E9gion de Mulhouse","staff present","personnels pr\u00E9sent","soins radioth\u00E9rapiques","services de radioth\u00E9rapie","continuit\u00E9 des soins","p\u00E9riode \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","\u00E9volution \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","we pointed five points out","France","detection","mesures","raison","being infected","reorganization","This reflection","severe form","lieu","Despite most","groupe hospitalier","Through biweekly meetings","cours de traitement","charge","Sud-Alsace","d\u00E9but","mani\u00E8re exponentielle","maximum","acc\u00E8s","compte","majorit\u00E9 des formes","prise","forme grave","Gr\u00E2ce","r\u00E9unions bihebdomadaires","moyens mat\u00E9riels","maladie","pays","d\u00E9partement","possibilit\u00E9","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","pistes de r\u00E9flexion","proc\u00E9dures"],"language":"fr"},

The number of deaths has increased with the increase in the number of infected patients. We aimed to develop a clinical model to predict the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients early. Methods Epidemiological, clinical, and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 severe COVID-19 patients (115 survivors and 68 nonsurvivors) from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to develop the predictive models. Five machine learning approaches (logistic regression, partial least squares regression, elastic net, random forest, and bagged flexible discriminant analysis) were used to select the features and predict the patients\u0027 outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models\u0027 performance. Sixty-four severe COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to externally validate the final predictive model. Results The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and nonsurvivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the derivation and external validation sets were 0.895 and 0.881, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.892 and 0.687 for the derivation set and 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, respectively, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff. The individual risk score based on the four selected variables and the corresponding probability of death can serve as indexes to assess the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients.

The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case of the model.

Furthermore, we define a new measurement, infection group differential (IGD) score, in assessing the infection ability of two human coronavirus groups.

However, without reaching herd immunity, the return of epidemic is possible. We investigate the impact of population structure, case importation, asymptomatic cases, and the number of contacts on a possible second wave of epidemic through mathematical modelling. Methods: we built a modified Susceptible-exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model with parameters mirroring those of the COVID-19 pandemic and reported simulated characteristics of epidemics for incidence, hospitalizations and deaths under different scenarios. Results: A larger percent of old people leads to higher number of hospitalizations, while a large percent of prior infection will effectively curb the epidemic. The number of imported cases and the speed of importation have small impact on the epidemic progression. However, a higher percent of asymptomatic cases slows the epidemic down and reduces the number of hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak. Finally, reducing the number of contacts among young people alone has moderate effects on themselves, but little effects on the old population. However, reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can mitigate the epidemic significantly in both groups, even though young people remain active within themselves. Conclusion: Reducing the number of contacts among high risk populations alone can mitigate the burden of epidemic in the whole society. Interventions targeting high risk groups may be more effective in containing or mitigating the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/520acb642762f4084bcf0a0ceae6ab4945172f44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20081109v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of contacts","wave of epidemic","return of epidemic","burden of epidemic","epidemic progression","epidemic peak","higher number of hospitalizations","number of imported cases","young people","larger percent of old people","higher percent of asymptomatic cases","old population","deaths","high risk groups","impact of population structure","high risk populations","case importation","speed of importation","small impact","little effects","moderate effects","large percent of prior infection","Proactive interventions","pandemic of coronavirus infected disease","incidence","simulated characteristics of epidemics","different scenarios","mathematical modelling","parameters","SEIR","regions","COVID","herd immunity","Results","Methods","Background","society","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

These strategies however carry a significant risk for mental health which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality, which is currently not included in modelling the impact of the pandemic. Methods: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure as applied to Switzerland as an exemplar. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood physical abuse and social isolation as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We also estimated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. Results: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by a subpopulation of 2.1 percent of the population, the average of whom suffer an average 9.79 YLL. Conclusions: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.

Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures. Design: Interrupted time-series analysis. Setting: United States. Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day. Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation). Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth. Based on the size of the epidemic at the time of implementation in each state, social distancing measures were associated with a decrease of 3,090 cases at 7 days, and 68,255 cases at 14 days, after implementation.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siedner, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Reynolds, Zahra; Gilbert, Rebecca F; Venkataramani, Atheendar; Tsai, Alexander C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2e649c3b7c320436fa59147e275db1ff780fadf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052373","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["days","implementation of statewide social distancing measures","time of implementation","form of statewide social distancing","Post-implementation","potential underestimation of social distancing","epidemic growth","log of daily COVID","mean daily COVID","cases","pre-implementation period","state-level COVID","growth rate","doubling time","potential confounding","Potential bias","decrease","neighboring states","United States","Interrupted time-series analysis","mean change","primary exposure","primary outcome","prior day","ecological data","aggregate nature","contemporaneous changes","significant health","spillovers","relation","Design","increase","Conclusion","economic impacts","testing","Measurements","account","incubation","Background","reduction","Objective","Setting","Limitations","Results","size"],"language":"en"},

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916\u002B0.0054*x1\u002B2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P\u003C10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people\u0027s work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)\uFF0CTI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"zhang, lianglu; wan, kangkang; chen, jing; lu, changming; dong, lanlan; wu, zhicheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e62e453735dc2022f4d81aa9b22769de30d0bb90.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","peak of infected number","interquartile range","epidemic dynamics","epidemic situation","closure of Wuhan city","number of infected individuals","total number of confirmed infection cases","total deaths","total confirmed cases","nCoV","number of susceptible population N","peak time","optimal parameters","data","serious public health concerns","life","assumption","R0","trend","Recent outbreak","SEIR modeling method","prediction","people\u0027s work","right track","study","accounting","China"],"language":"en"},

Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO\u0027s shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO\u0027s shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Price, A.

Design: Weighted prevalence estimates of students e-cigarette use using the 2014-2019 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS). For each year, t-tests for significance were used to compare estimates with those from the preceding year; t-tests were not performed on data for 2019 due to the change in survey format from paper to electronic. Setting: The NYTS is an annual school-based cross-sectional survey of US middle school (MS) and high school (HS) students. Participants: 117,472 students. Measurements: Self-report of past 30 day e-cigarette use based on students smoking status. Smoking status is assessed by asking if students have ever tried smoking, even one or two puffs, with never smokers responding no. Former smokers respond yes but have not smoked at all in the past 30 days. Current smokers used cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days. Frequent e-cigarette use is defined as use on 20 or more days in the past month. Findings: Past 30-day and frequent e-cigarette use increased among never, former, and current smoker youth from 2014-2019. In 2019, a greater proportion of current smokers used e-cigarettes frequently (HS = 46.1%, 95% CI: 39.1, 53.2; MS = 27.4%, 95% CI: 21.1, 33.6) compared to former smokers (HS = 23.2%, 95% CI: 18.1, 28.2; MS = 10.9%, 95% CI: 6.1, 15.7) and never smokers (HS = 3.7%, 95% CI: 3.0, 4.3; MS = 0.7%, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.9).

Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age or sex. In addition, using data from the UK Biobank, we implemented a candidate driven approach to evaluate linkage between severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and genetic variation associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Among our findings, our scan identified previously reported eQTLs for CD55 (a negative regulator of complement activation) and SNPs in Complement Factor H (CFH) and Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha (C4BPA), which play central roles in complement activation and innate immunity and were previously linked to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to several putative genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramlall, V.; Thangaraj, P.; Tatonetti, N.

Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and over their limits. Objectives : To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 by applying AI to chest CT and evaluate validation performance. Methods : In this retrospective multi-site study, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest CT exams to learn the detection pattern of COVID-19 patients. We analysed the data from 181 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as 1200 other non-COVID-19 control patients to build and assess the performance of the model. The datasets were collected from 2 different hospital sites of the CHU Liege, Belgium. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results : 1381 patients were included in this study. The average age was 64.4 and 63.8 years with a gender balance of 56% and 52% male in the COVID-19 and control group, respectively. The final curated dataset used for model construction and validation consisted of chest CT scans of 892 patients.

We demonstrate that the CoV proofreading nonstructural protein (nsp14) 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) is required for normal CoV recombination and that its genetic inactivation causes significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of recombination in both infected cells and released virions.

In this study, we aimed to provide a coherent overview from published studies of the duration of viral detection and viral load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity and age. Method We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1. November 2019 and 23rd of April 2020. We included studies that reported individual viral data over time measuring negative conversion by two consecutive negative tests, individual clinical severity and age. We excluded studies that reported viral data as patient fraction, reported only baseline data, included solely asymptomatic patients or were interventional studies. Extracted data included author, title, design, sample size, thresholds and genes of RT-PCR, patient age, COVID-19 severity, clinical characteristics, treatment, location of viral sampling, duration of viral detection, and viral load. We pooled the data of selected studies to determine effect estimates of duration of viral detection. Combined viral load was visualized over time. Findings Out of 7226 titles screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis and 22 studies in the quantitative analysis comprising 650 COVID-19 patients. The pooled estimate of the duration of positive detection of the virus was in mild adult patients 12.1 days (CI: 10.12, 14.05) after symptom onset in the upper respiratory tract (URT), 24.1 days (CI: 10.02, 38.19) in lower respiratory tract (LRT), and 15.5 days (CI: 8.04, 22.88) in faeces. Further, in mild adult patients, the maximum viral load was ~ 6.61 x 108 viral copies/mL in the URT and ~ 2.69 x 108 viral copies/mL in the LRT, within the first week of symptom onset. The maximum viral load in faeces was reported as ~ 3.55 x 107 copies/mL on Day 9. In moderate-severe adult patients, the pooled estimate of mean duration of positive viral detection in the URT was 15.8 days (CI: 11.12, 20.56) after symptom onset, 23.2 days (CI: 21.49, 24.97) in the LRT, 20.8 days (CI: 16.40, 25.17) in faeces. The maximum viral load was 4.60 x 109 copies/mL on Day 8 in the URT, 3.45 x 108 copies/mL on Day 11 in the LRT, 2.76 x 106 copies/mL on Day 18 in faeces and 1 x 104 copies/mL on Day 3 in blood. In children with mild symptoms, the pooled estimate of the mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 viral detection was 11.1 days (CI: 7.14, 15.11) in the URT and 16.0 days (CI: 11.49, 20,47) in the faeces, without reporting quantitative viral data. Viral positivity was detected in the urine and eye in one patient. Interpretation Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the URT, the LRT and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT, whereas the differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection in feces and the URT for moderate-severe patients was shown. Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in the URT within first weak of infection, whereas maximum viral load has been observed to occur later and within the second week of infection in the LRT.

Bats have been suggested to act as natural reservoirs for both these viruses, and periodic monitoring of coronaviruses in bats may thus provide important clues about emergent infectious viruses. The Eastern bent-wing bat Miniopterus fuliginosus is distributed extensively throughout China. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in samples of M. fuliginosus collected from nine Chinese provinces during 2011\u20132013. The only coronavirus genus found was Alphacoronavirus. We established six complete and five partial genomic sequences of alphacoronaviruses, which revealed that they could be divided into two distinct lineages, with close relationships to coronaviruses in Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus. Recombination was confirmed by detecting putative breakpoints of Lineage 1 coronaviruses in M. fuliginosus and M. pusillus (Wu et al., 2015), which supported the results of topological and phylogenetic analyses. The established alphacoronavirus genome sequences showed high similarity to other alphacoronaviruses found in other Miniopterus species, suggesting that their transmission in different Miniopterus species may provide opportunities for recombination with different alphacoronaviruses. The genetic information for these novel alphacoronaviruses will improve our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, with potentially important implications for the transmission of human diseases.","publish_time":"2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Jiang; Yang, Li; Ren, Xianwen; Zhang, Junpeng; Dong, Jie; Sun, Lilian; Zhu, Yafang; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Shuyi; Wu, Zhiqiang; Jin, Qi","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53248fc50f4a9d78a757c28569c828a470aabb5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125516/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-016-5039-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wu"],"organizations":["Eastern","Recombination","Lineage"],"locations":["Middle East","China","Miniopterus"],"keyphrases":["genetic diversity of coronaviruses","Miniopterus pusillus","Miniopterus magnater","different Miniopterus species","different alphacoronaviruses","periodic monitoring of coronaviruses","novel alphacoronaviruses","coronavirus genus","Eastern bent-wing bat Miniopterus fuliginosus","partial genomic sequences of alphacoronaviruses","Recombination","genetic information","Bats","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","established alphacoronavirus genome sequences","important clues","important implications","emergent infectious viruses","transmission of human diseases","close relationships","high similarity","opportunities","significant public health threats","understanding","putative breakpoints of Lineage","evolution","samples","distinct lineages","results of topological","phylogenetic analyses","natural reservoirs","Chinese provinces","Wu","China"],"language":"en"},

The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). METHODS: Sixteen 24-week-old male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. RESULTS: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. CONCLUSION: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Li-Zhen; Wang, Jia-Li; Kong, Ling; Huang, Le; Tian, Li; Pang, Qian-Qian; Wang, Xin-Luan; Qin, Ling","journal":"J Orthop Translat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd72dbca2c8c9bc8345d9e100474a7f52fc44ff8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8834037938bd709903ef25732dbcfd5ea681a0cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5892381.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214031X17300827; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2018.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29662787/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214031X17300827","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAON"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SAON induction","treatment of SAON","SAON group","incidence of SAON","liver of SAON rats","SAON rat model","molecular mechanism of SAON","metabolic disorders of SAON","current SAON small model","weeks","future rat SAON studies","Dawley rats","detailed induction","LPS injection","pulsed injection of LPS","present study","cost-effective animal model","small animal model","intravenous injection of LPS","cost-effective preclinical experimental model","Histological evaluation","intraperitoneal injections of MPS","proximal tibia","evaluation protocols","potential drugs","study body metabolism","lower lean mass","lower osteoblast surface","metabolic dual energy X-ray absorptiometry","distal tibia","advanced evaluation approaches","evaluation of tissue composition","preclinical disease models","pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide","TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL","testing prevention","treatment concept","angiography","cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis","serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide","available large animal models","higher fat percent","Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type","higher marrow fat fraction","Micro-CT","oedema area","bilateral tibiae","bilateral femora","Hepatic oedema","histological examination","significant bone degradation","bone turnover markers","Micro-computed tomography","features","quadrupedal rabbits","bipedal emus","assessment protocol","leakage particles","Microfil perfusion","collagen","histopathology","animals","lipid accumulation","week-old male Sprague","osteocalcin","blood vessels","pathophysiology","Histomorphometry","hour","OBJECTIVE","methylprednisolone","relevant diseases","normal controls","clinical feature","time interval","aetiology","METHODS","CONCLUSION","times","sacrifice","RESULTS","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, HSV infections at birth (herpes neonatorum) can result in a disseminated disease associated with a fatal multiorgan failure. Congenital HCMV infections can result in miscarriage, serious birth defects or developmental disabilities. Antibody-based interventions with hyperimmunoglobulins showed encouraging results in clinical studies, but clearly need to be improved. The isolation of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is a promising strategy to establish potent therapy options against HSV and HCMV infections. Monoclonal antibodies are commonly isolated from hybridomas or EBV-immortalized B-cell clones. The screening procedure to identify virus-specific cells from a cell mixture is a challenging step, since most of the highly neutralizing antibodies target complex conformational epitopes on the virus surface. Conventional assays such as ELISA are based on purified viral proteins and inappropriate to display complex epitopes. To overcome this obstacle, we have established two full-virus based methods that allow screening for cells and antibodies targeting complex conformational epitopes on viral surface antigens. The methods are suitable to detect surface antigen-specific cells from a cell mixture and may facilitate the isolation of highly neutralizing antibodies against HSV and HCMV.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alt, Mira; Falk, Jessica; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, Anna Maria; Kropff, Barbara; Sinzger, Christian; Krawczyk, Adalbert","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a36cab88be5a21b238cbf9a24d68cb3209739d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094464.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175918300565; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2018.07.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175918300565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30056033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralizing antibodies","HSV infections","virus surface","neutralizing monoclonal antibodies","complex epitopes","virus-specific cells","Congenital HCMV infections","complex conformational epitopes","cell mixture","Abstract Infections","herpes simplex virus","surface antigen-specific cells","viral surface antigens","isolation","methods","Antibody-based interventions","viral proteins","herpes neonatorum","screening procedure","EBV-immortalized B-cell clones","serious birth defects","hyperimmunoglobulins","miscarriage","promising strategy","potent therapy options","encouraging results","hybridomas","developmental disabilities","disseminated disease","clinical studies","ELISA","life-threatening diseases","fatal multiorgan failure","human cytomegalovirus","immunosuppressed patients","challenging step","Conventional assays","obstacle"],"language":"en"},

We cloned camel IFN-\u03B1 coding sequences and identified a total of eleven subtypes. The canonical IFN-\u03B1 subtype designated as IFN-\u03B11 contained a 555-bp Open Reading Frame encoding a protein of 184 amino acids. Recombinant IFN-\u03B11 protein was produced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03B11 induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in camel kidney cells. The purified protein also showed potent in-vitro antiviral activity against Camelpox Virus in kidney cells. The identified camel IFN-\u03B1 protein and the subtypes will facilitate a better understanding of the host immune response to viral infections in camel and the development of potential antiviral biologicals for zoonotic diseases for which camel act as a reservoir.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Premraj, Avinash; Aleyas, Abi George; Nautiyal, Binita; Rasool, Thaha Jamal","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c768e755cd6c50a04bf1031620531681b87453.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112685.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019305413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014632/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019305413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["Open Reading Frame"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Recombinant camel IFN-\u03B11","identified camel IFN-\u03B1 protein","camel act","camel kidney cells","camel IFN-\u03B1 coding sequences","Recombinant IFN-\u03B11 protein","IFNs of dromedary camel","molecular immune response of dromedary camel","purified protein","canonical IFN-\u03B1 subtype","innate host immune response","subtypes","vitro antiviral activity","development of potential antiviral biologicals","stimulated genes","zoonotic diseases","mRNA expression of interferon","Camelpox Virus","ISGs","viral infections","key livestock species","characterization of type","important cytokines","better understanding","bp Open Reading Frame","identification","total","Abstract Investigations","coli","viruses","amino acids","lack of species-specific reagents","inclusion bodies","time","reservoir"],"language":"en"},

Aim To determine if patients who visit EDs have an increased risk of TB infection. Using South Korean inpatient sample data (2012), the risk of TB occurrence during 90 days after hospitalization for patients admitted via EDs was compared with that for patients admitted via outpatient clinics. Methods The data of the 2012 Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service \u2013 National Inpatient Sample were used. TB diagnosis was based on International Classification of Diseases Version 10 [all TB (A15\u2013A19), pulmonary TB (A15-A16) and extrapulmonary TB (A17\u2013A18)]. Findings After propensity score matching using the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, 191,997 patients (64,017 patients admitted via EDs and 127,908 patients admitted via outpatient clinics) were included in this study. There was no significant difference in baseline patient characteristics between the two groups. The percentage of patients with TB admitted via EDs was higher than that of patients admitted via outpatient clinics. The likelihood of active TB occurrence was 30% higher for all TB [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12\u20131.52] and pulmonary TB (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.10\u20131.53) in patients admitted via EDs compared with patients admitted via outpatient clinics; this difference was significant. However, no difference in the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB was observed between the two groups. Conclusions The likelihood of TB infection was greater in patients admitted via EDs than in patients admitted via outpatient clinics.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, J-Y.; Kim, H-J.; Yoon, C.; Lee, K.; Yeo, M.; Min, K-B.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fa08a2ee0fadf2bb691ff97f79c4403b3ae0ede.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114590.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670118301828; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670118301828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29608938/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2018.03.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service \u2013 National Inpatient Sample","International Classification of Diseases Version","CI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB diagnosis","EDs","percentage of patients","risk of TB occurrence","occurrence of extrapulmonary TB","likelihood of TB infection","outpatient clinics","increased risk of TB infection","likelihood of active TB occurrence","significant difference","HR","CI","groups","National Inpatient Sample","South Korean inpatient sample data","A15-A16","clinical characteristics","high risk of infectious disease transmission","baseline patient characteristics","Assessment Service","Health Insurance Review","demographic","propensity score matching","International Classification of Diseases Version","A19","days","hospitalization","Summary Background Emergency departments","A17","hazard ratio","Findings","A18","Conclusions","confidence interval","Methods","tuberculosis","outbreaks","study"],"language":"en"},

Disease control is based on the mass vaccination of dogs and cats. We used data collected by the passive surveillance system of the city of Campinas from 2011 to 2015, to describe the temporal and geographic distributions of the bat specimens and RABV and discuss the current rabies surveillance with the advent of the declaration of canine and feline rabies-free areas in Brazil. We described the species, locations and health statuses of the collected bat specimens. Moreover, all samples were submitted for RABV diagnosis. Then, we performed a time series decomposition for each bat family. Additionally, we determined the spatiotemporal relative risk for RABV infection using the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of RABV-positive and RABV-negative bats. From the 2537 bat specimens, the most numerous family was Molossidae (72%), followed by Vespertilionidae (14%) and Phyllostomidae (13%). The bat families behaved differently in terms of seasonal and spatial patterns. The distribution of bats varied geographically in the urban environment, with Molossidae and Phyllostomidae being observed downtown and Vespertilionidae being observed in peripheral zones. Concurrently, a significant relative risk of RABV infection was observed downtown for Vespertilionidae and in peripheral zones for Molossidae. No RABV-positive sample clusters were observed. As a result of the official declaration of RABV-free areas in southern Brazil, mass dog and cat vaccinations are expected to halt in the near future. This stoppage would make most dog and cat populations susceptible to other RABV lineages, such as those maintained by non-haematophagous bats. In this scenario, all information available on bats and RABV distribution in urban areas is essential. Currently, few studies have been conducted. Some local health authorities, such as that in Campinas, are spontaneously basing their surveillance efforts on bat rabies, which is the alternative in reality scenario of increased susceptibility to bat-associated RABV that is developing in Brazil.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dias, R.

International health community\u0027s attention goes towards this mass gathering and the possibility of the development of any respiratory tract infections due to the high risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses. Method We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases for relevant papers describing the prevalence of respiratory viruses among Hajj pilgrims. Results The retrieved articles were summarized based on the methodology of testing for these viruses. A total of 31 studies were included in the quantitative/qualitative analyses. The main methods used for the diagnosis of most common respiratory viruses were polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Influenza, rhinovirus and parainfluenza were the most common viruses detected among pilgrims. Coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV were also detected among pilgrims. The acquisition of MERS-CoV remains very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections. Conclusions Well conducted multinational follow-up studies using the same methodology of testing are necessary for accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections among Hajj pilgrims. Post-Hajj cohort studies would further evaluate the impact of the Hajj on the acquisition of respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Benkouiten, Samir; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d12956c01090caa6f3bea52f2dd0212379c0478f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110954.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.04.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893918300607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673810/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893918300607","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hajj pilgrims","acquisition of respiratory viruses","common respiratory viruses","prevalence of respiratory viruses","common viruses","millions of pilgrims","respiratory tract infections","annual Hajj","systematic screening of pilgrims","Post-Hajj cohort studies","acquisition of MERS","accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections","methodology of testing","MERS-CoV","high risk of acquisition","multinational follow-up studies","culture","polymerase chain reaction","relevant papers","PubMed","PCR","Scopus databases","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","diagnosis","mass","MEDLINE","ELISA","parainfluenza","development","impact","International health community\u0027s attention","Abstract Background","rhinovirus","Conclusions","possibility","qualitative analyses","main methods","Coronaviruses","world","retrieved articles","total"],"language":"en"},

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.

Mice were intranasally vaccinated using a prime (Indiana)-boost (Chandipura) immunization approach and challenged with the virulent WNV-LSU-AR01. Ninety-percent (9 of 10) of the vaccinated mice survived as compared to 10% of the mock-vaccinated mice after WNV lethal challenge. Histopathological examination of brain tissues revealed neuronal necrosis in mock-vaccinated mice but not in vaccinated mice, and vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed a strong neutralizing antibody response against WNV. Extensive immunological analysis using polychromatic flow cytometry staining revealed that vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed robust cellular immune responses as evidenced by up-regulation of CD4\u002B CD154\u002B IFN\u03B3\u002B T cells in vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice.

The E protein is thought to promote virion assembly, which occurs in the Golgi region of infected cells. It has also been implicated in the release of infectious particles after budding. The E protein has ion channel activity in vitro, although a role for channel activity in infection has not been established. Furthermore, the membrane topology of the E protein is of considerable debate, and the protein may adopt more than one topology during infection. We previously showed that the HD of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is required for the efficient release of infectious virus, an activity that correlated with disruption of the secretory pathway. Here we report that a single residue within the hydrophobic domain, Thr16, is required for secretory pathway disruption. Substitutions of other residues for Thr16 were not tolerated. Mutations of Thr16 did not impact virus assembly as judged by virus-like particle production, suggesting that alteration of secretory pathway and assembly are independent activities. We also examined how the membrane topology of IBV E affected its function by generating mutant versions that adopted either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology. We found that a transmembrane topology was required for disrupting the secretory pathway, but was less efficient for virus-like particle production. The hairpin version of E was unable to disrupt the secretory pathway or produce particles. The findings reported here identify properties of the E protein that are important for its function, and provide insight into how the E protein may perform multiple roles during infection.","publish_time":"2012-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruch, Travis R.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c988a00ed94308e36a8814b391ead01480efb60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3343006.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus E protein","membrane topology of IBV E","small membrane protein","virus assembly","hairpin version of E","secretory pathway disruption","infection","alteration of secretory pathway","membrane hairpin topology","transmembrane topology","infectious bronchitis virus","efficient release of infectious virus","release of infectious particles","function","ion channel activity","HD","virion assembly","particle production","Mutations of Thr16","single predicted hydrophobic domain","single residue","defined role","independent activities","multiple roles","considerable debate","mutant versions","Golgi region of infected cells","properties","insight","Substitutions","residues","findings"],"language":"en"},

Elimination of the C-mannose on sGP did not significantly alter protein biosynthesis, processing or structure. Furthermore, the protective effect of sGP on endothelial barrier function, currently the only known activity of sGP, was unaltered. It is possible that C-mannosylation may be a common post-translational modification of viral transmembrane glycoproteins where it could play a role in particle maturation and/or entry by stabilizing the structure of these proteins. In this regard, C-mannosylation of sGP may be an anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of Ebola.","publish_time":"2007-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falzarano, Darryl; Krokhin, Oleg; Van Domselaar, Gary; Wolf, Kristin; Seebach, Jochen; Schnittler, Hans-Joachim; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fd0395471150f3f4c85e1125b0aafd77e2bf8a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103365.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207004072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207004072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["C-mannosylation","viral protein","W-x","x-W","C-mannose","known activity of sGP","protective effect of sGP","Ebola virus soluble glycoprotein sGP","common post-translational modification of viral transmembrane glycoproteins","protein biosynthesis","structure","rare post-translation modification","glycoprotein gene of Ebola","endothelial barrier function","Abstract Mass spectrometry analysis","product of unedited transcripts","anomaly","recognition motifs","particle maturation","entry","role","unique manner","processing","regard","Elimination","tryptophan"],"language":"en"},

We estimated the values of key infection-related quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection. We suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vegvari, Carolin; Hadjichrysanthou, Christoforos; Cau\u00EBt, Emilie; Lawrence, Emma; Cori, Anne; de Wolf, Frank; Anderson, Roy M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ddcfc9bedfb0a87a7221dd2448bd41d3ba9cc51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4930163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27367230/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Roche"],"organizations":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral load data","viral load peak","dynamics of viral load","viral load curve","viral growth","severity of infection","placebo group viral load measurements","Acute viral infections","values of key infection-related quantities","duration of infection","measurement of infection","course of natural infection","precise estimates of virological quantities","Total symptom severity","clinical endpoint measurements","novel treatment","sensitive endpoint","therapeutic trials","oseltamivir trials","impact of novel therapies","practical challenges","volunteer challenge studies","Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods","area","accurate assessment","goal","individuals","correlations","human host","Roche","investigators","patients","decay","efficacy","body temperature","laboratory experiments","basic reproductive number","greatest variation","example of influenza"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of SARS. As with the outcome of human infection, intranasal infection of C57BL/6J mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV results in high-titer virus replication within the lung, induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. Using this model, we investigated the role of the complement system during SARS-CoV infection. We observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following SARS-CoV infection. To test whether this activation contributed to protective or pathologic outcomes, we utilized mice deficient in C3 (C3(\u2013/\u2013)), the central component of the complement system. Relative to C57BL/6J control mice, SARS-CoV-infected C3(\u2013/\u2013) mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Significantly fewer neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the lungs of C3(\u2013/\u2013) mice than in C56BL/6J controls, and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cytokine and chemokine levels in both the lungs and the sera of C3(\u2013/\u2013) mice than in controls. These studies identify the complement system as an important host mediator of SARS-CoV-induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibiting complement signaling after SARS-CoV infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic.","publish_time":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gralinski, Lisa E.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Morrison, Thomas E.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Jensen, Kara; Leist, Sarah R.; Whitmore, Alan; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/948028bf6ac0f66ea490a476c599db04fb42a50f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6178621.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301856/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01753-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["following SARS-CoV infection","mouse-adapted SARS-CoV results","J mice","complement system","CoV-induced disease","global outbreak of SARS","important host mediator of SARS","mice deficient","lungs of C3","complement cascade","J control mice","intranasal infection of C57BL","outcome of human infection","activation","infected C3","sera of C3","J controls","reduced lung pathology","immune-driven pathologies","respiratory dysfunction","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","immune cell infiltration","severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","inflammatory monocytes","subsequent studies","mediated disease","induction of inflammatory cytokines","ARDS","lower cytokine","high-titer virus replication","chemokines","chemokine levels","systemic proinflammatory response","equivalent viral loads","pathologic outcomes","day","weight loss","fewer neutrophils","role","central component","C56BL","data","model"],"language":"en"},

Memory B cells do not actively secrete antibody but instead maintain their immunoglobulin in the membrane\u2010bound form that serves as the antigen\u2010specific B\u2010cell receptor. In contrast, plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells that no longer express surface\u2010bound immunoglobulin but continuously secrete antibody without requiring further antigenic stimulation. Pre\u2010existing serum or mucosal antibody elicited by plasma cells (or other intermediate antibody\u2010secreting cells) represents the first line of defense against reinfection and is critical for protection against many microbial diseases. However, the mechanisms involved with maintaining long\u2010term antibody production are not fully understood. Here, we examine several models of long\u2010term humoral immunity and present a new model, described as the \u2018Imprinted Lifespan\u2019 model of plasma cell longevity. The foundation of this model is that plasma cells are imprinted with a predetermined lifespan based on the magnitude of B\u2010cell signaling that occurs during the induction of an antigen\u2010specific humoral immune response. This represents a testable hypothesis and may explain why some antigen\u2010specific antibody responses fade over time whereas others are maintained essentially for life.","publish_time":"2010-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amanna, Ian J.; Slifka, Mark K.","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cbcd9f536c060f591352bcd5a93ba7c694948ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165522.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20636813/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2010.00912.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma cells","differentiated cells","types of cells","secreting cells","memory B cells","mucosal antibody","intermediate antibody","specific B","specific antibody responses","model of plasma cell longevity","long\u2010term antibody production","magnitude of B","specific humoral immune response","models of long\u2010term humoral immunity","bound immunoglobulin","new model","cell receptor","Imprinted Lifespan","predetermined lifespan","bound form","express surface","protection","reinfection","vaccination","induction","line of defense","Pre\u2010existing serum","microbial diseases","membrane","Summary","mechanisms","time","contrast","antigenic stimulation","foundation","testable hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Of the 60 samples collected from the patients with acute asthma exacerbations, rhinovirus was detected in 12 patients (20%), respiratory syncytial virus in 5 (8%), adenovirus in 5 (8%), and influenza virus in 1 (1.6%). Respiratory pathogens were not detected in 37 (61%) samples. All the samples investigated showed single viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. RSV was more commonly associated with more severe attacks. Both the study design (e.g., time of sampling, age of the patients, etc.) and also the method used for viral detection influence the frequency of detection of the respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassanzad, Maryam; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Darougar, Sepideh; Tashayoie-Nejad, Sabereh; Boloursaz, Mohammad Reza; Mahdaviani, Seyed Alireza; Baghaie, Nooshin; Ghaffaripour, Hosseinali; Velayati, Ali Akbar","journal":"Interventional medicine \u0026 applied science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/956f777cf3a26f2989c840cbb927ac552b95732e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32148899/; https://doi.org/10.1556/1646.10.2018.35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dr. Daneshvari Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","patients","samples","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory pathogens","acute asthma exacerbations","viral detection","common viruses","study design","rhinovirus","influenza virus","RSV","adenovirus","single viral infection","role of particular viral infections","frequency of detection","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","Daneshvari Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department","Tehran","virology laboratory","time of sampling","nucleic acid testing","children","total","variety of triggers","swab","submission","Iran","age","nasopharyngeal aspirate","MATERIALS","METHODS","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","severe attacks","admission","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

They play a role in innate and adaptive immunity and are targets for various bacterial and viral adhesins. Two pathogens that colonize the normally sterile lower respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Both pathogens bind to CEACAMs and elicit a variety of cellular reactions, including bacterial internalization, cell adhesion and apoptosis. METHODS: To analyze the (co-) expression of CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in different lung tissues with respect to COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration, immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections of 19 donors were studied. To address short-term effects of cigarette smoke and acute inflammation, transcriptional regulation of CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and different CEACAM1 isoforms by cigarette smoke extract, interferons, Toll-like receptor agonists, and bacteria was tested in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by quantitative PCR. Corresponding CEACAM protein levels were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections showed the most frequent and intense staining for CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium, but revealed no significant differences in connection with COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration. In NHBE cells, mRNA expression of CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3L and CEACAM1-3S were up-regulated by interferons alpha, beta and gamma, as well as the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Interferon-gamma also increased CEACAM5 expression. These results were confirmed on protein level by FACS analysis. Importantly, also NTHI and M. catarrhalis increased CEACAM1 mRNA levels. This effect was independent of the ability to bind to CEACAM1. The expression of CEACAM6 was not affected by any treatment or bacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not find a direct correlation between CEACAM1 expression and COPD, the COPD-associated bacteria NTHi and M. catarrhalis were able to increase the expression of their own receptor on host cells. Further, the data suggest a role for CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in the phenomenon of increased host susceptibility to bacterial infection upon viral challenge in the human respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klaile, Esther; Klassert, Tilman E; Scheffrahn, Inka; M\u00FCller, Mario M; Heinrich, Annina; Heyl, Kerstin A; Dienemann, Hendrik; Gr\u00FCnewald, Christiane; Bals, Robert; Singer, Bernhard B; Slevogt, Hortense","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fb8269503a524e2257482ce479a05abd732ddfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941132/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-14-85","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["PCR","FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEACAM1 expression","mRNA expression of CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1","CEACAM5 expression","different CEACAM1 isoforms","expression of CEACAM6","catarrhalis increased CEACAM1 mRNA levels","related cell adhesion molecules CEACAM1","bacterial infection","human lung","COPD-associated bacteria NTHi","transcriptional regulation of CEACAM5","bacterial internalization","NHBE cells","host cells","human respiratory tract","smoking status","different lung tissues","granulocyte infiltration","Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections","Moraxella catarrhalis","RESULTS","role","pathogens","phenomenon of increased host susceptibility","cigarette smoke extract","short-term effects of cigarette smoke","viral challenge","sterile lower respiratory tract","interferons alpha","viral adhesins","Corresponding CEACAM protein levels","receptor agonists","FACS analysis","Interferon-gamma","stained paraffin sections","patients","acute inflammation","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","BGP","respect","non-typable Haemophilus influenzae","polycytidylic acid","Toll","CD66a","TLR3 agonist polyinosinic","significant differences","connection","alveolar epithelium","intense staining","variety of cellular reactions","carcinoembryonic antigen","adaptive immunity","apoptosis","CD66c","CD66e","direct correlation","flow cytometry","quantitative PCR","CEACAMs","BACKGROUND","donors","beta","NCA","ability","treatment","data","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In the present study archived tissues of 1,419 bats of 22 species from 6 families collected in 5 south and southwest provinces in China were screened by pan-HV RT-PCR following viral metagenomic analysis. As a result nine HVs have been identified in two bat species in two provinces and phylogenetically classified into two species, Laibin virus (LAIV, ICTV approved species, 1 strain) and Xuan son virus (XSV, proposed species, 8 strains). Additionally, 709 serum samples of these bats were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity between different HVs using expressed recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) of LAIV, XSV and Seoul virus (SEOV). The cross-reactivity of some bat sera were further confirmed by western blot (WB) using three rNPs followed by fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) against live SEOV. Results showed that the total HV seropositive rate of bat sera was 18.5% (131/709) with many cross reacting with two or all three rNPs and several able to neutralize SEOV. WB analysis using the three rNPs and their specific hyperimmune sera demonstrated cross-reactivity between XSV/SEOV and LAIV/XSV, but not LAIV/SEOV, indicating that XSV is antigenically closer to human-infecting HVs. In addition a study of the distribution of the viruses identified an area covering the region between Chinese Guangxi and North Vietnam, in which XSV and LAIV circulate within different bat colonies with a high seroprevalence. A circulation sphere of bat-borne HVs has therefore been proposed.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Lin; Wu, Jianmin; Li, Qi; Wei, Yamei; Tan, Zhizhou; Cai, Jianqiu; Guo, Huancheng; Yang, Ling\u2019en; Huang, Xiaohong; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Fuqiang; He, Biao; Tu, Changchun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53847cf95615b651c07388b52222211db0b4d303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6358112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668611/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAIV","WB","SEOV","XSV/SEOV","XSV"],"locations":["China","North Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["XSV","LAIV","bat species","different HVs","rNPs","divergent HVs","human-infecting HVs","cross-reactivity","proposed species","Bats","live SEOV","different bat colonies","Laibin virus","Seoul virus","cross reacting","ICTV approved species","circulation sphere of bat","total HV seropositive rate of bat sera","Xuan son virus","high seroprevalence","WB analysis","specific hyperimmune sera","identified reservoirs of hantaviruses","fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test","southwest provinces","present study","viral metagenomic analysis","pan-HV RT-PCR","FAVNT","expressed recombinant nucleocapsid proteins","region","North Vietnam","area","Chinese Guangxi","China","antigenic relationship","distribution","public health","families","western blot","tissues","significance","Results","ELISA","strains","recent years","addition","serum samples"],"language":"en"},

The intestinal flora of pigs contains several hundred microbial species, mostly strict anaerobes. A great amount of these bacteria reside in the large intestine that in adult pigs consists of mainly Gram-positive bacteria such as cocci, lactobacilli, eubacteria, and clostridia. The composition of the intestinal microflora is a result of the interaction between the microorganisms that colonize the gut and the intestinal physiology of the pigs. While a part of this microflora is constantly present in the gut (resident flora), some microorganisms have a short residence and dynamically change the composition of the microflora. The stability and diversity of this flora has a tremendous role in maintaining the health status of the pigs, especially during the suckling and post-weaning period. The digestive tract of the newborn piglet is specialized on a diet comprising milk. Therefore, a high lactase activity is present in the small intestine, at least for as long as milk comprises the dominant feed source. While several methods, including molecular-based techniques, are available to detect and identify unculturable bacterial flora of the gut, there is a need for more advanced techniques to measure the functional status of the normal flora in response to dietary feed and environmental stress.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katouli, M.; Wallgren, P.","journal":"Biology of Growing Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ccd83ef8ab2d0324ab40b54bff3b4eaa64addc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877182309700359; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877182309700359","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal flora of pigs","normal flora","resident flora","intestinal microflora","unculturable bacterial flora","adult pigs","growing pigs","gut","intestinal physiology","health status","microorganisms","composition","milk","available information","dietary feed","functional status","Gram-positive bacteria","advanced techniques","small intestine","large intestine","molecular-based techniques","dominant feed source","response","population dynamics","animal\u0027s life","lactobacilli","chapter","different stages","microbial species","tremendous role","newborn piglet","cocci","environmental stress","high lactase activity","suckling","changes","result","factors","Publisher Summary","post-weaning period","digestive tract","eubacteria","strict anaerobes","methods","disease","short residence","diversity","interaction","need","clostridia","stability"],"language":"en"},

These\u0022bag squeezer\u0022designs are bulky and heavy, depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also, invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries. In this work, we present a low-cost ($\u003C$\\$200), portable (fits in an 8\u0022x8\u0022x4\u0022box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19 patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost ($\u003C$\\$400 including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV provides 0-20 cmH$_{2}$O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin$^{-1}$. We hope that our report will encourage implementations and further studies on helmet-based NIV for treating COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Yasser; Fahad, Hossain Mohammad; Muin, Sifat; Gopalan, Karthik","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5db273f730a39aa61bfb9bfba6824b7aa463d048.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11008v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["invasive mechanical ventilation of patients","noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation","helmet-based NIV","bilevel positive airway pressure","continuous positive airway pressure","O pressure","invasive ventilation","vast majority of patients","helmet-based solution","CPAP","BiPAP","featured ventilators","emergency ventilators","early-stage COVID","low-resource settings","mechanical squeezing of bag","rapid-response ventilators","valve-masks","bag squeezer","Coronavirus disease","end-to-end solution","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","aerosolization","intensive care unit support","box","supply capacity","studies","high-pressure blower fan","unprecedented need","breathing assistance devices","x4","designs","SARS-CoV","non-invasive ventilator","flow rates","relief","modes","Ambu-bags","difficulty","moving parts","x8","implementations","spread","common concern","viral filters","developing countries","fits","demand","Lmin","report","use","work","cmH"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge of random testing outcomes will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M.; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1348acbc5966975c15c13e0857c4e9285c06b76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04614v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fraction of infected people","quantitative effect of restrictive measures","real-time assessment","Knowledge of random testing outcomes","tested people","daily sampling","noisy sampling data","frequent sampling","pandemic","current fraction of infections","higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences","real time","transmission rates","reliable data","order of magnitude higher","key variable","shorter delay times","efficiency of new means","level","number","evolution","analysis of sewage water","homogeneous population","control model of mitigation","conservative estimate","present ones","day","relaxation of restrictions","reboot","load","healthcare system","optimized decisions","progression","feedback","place","symptomatic individuals","disease","size","COVID","predictability"],"language":"en"},

The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor.

Here, we describe a learning and classification algorithm based on hyperdimensional (HD) computing that, unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, enables computationally efficient updates to incrementally incorporate new data and adapt to changing contexts. EMG signal encoding for both training and classification is performed using the same set of simple operations on 10,000-element random hypervectors enabling updates on the fly. Through human experiments using a custom EMG acquisition system, we demonstrate 88.87% classification accuracy on 13 individual finger flexion and extension gestures. Using simple model updates, we preserve this accuracy with less than 5.48% degradation when expanding to 21 commonly used gestures or when subject to changing situational contexts.

Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows correlations with the available official data on the number of infected individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19 outbreak started in both North (Lombardia and Veneto) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested on other epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other countries.

One of the main tools of the policymakers is to control the contact rate among the population, commonly referred to as social distancing, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. We pose a mean-field game model of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of utility from contacts but also risk of infection from those contacts. We compute and compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes individuals acting selfishly to maximize their own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which is the strategy maximizing the total utility of the population. We prove that the infected always want to make more contacts than the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the need to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave). Additionally, we compute the socially optimal strategies, given the costs to incentivize people to change from their selfish strategies. We find that if we impose limited resources, curbing contacts of the infected is more important after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the price of anarchy of this system, to understand the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise, which is when public policy would be most effective.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Samuel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6ab970140fbab89b4cb0e27b174ea89c68a5c35.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06758v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MFE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal strategy","curbing contacts","optimal strategies","dynamic strategy","MFE","disease epidemic","total utility","trade-off of utility","population","selfish strategies","mean-field equilibrium","right public policy","mean-field game model of individuals","quarantining","policymakers","outbreak","sick paid leave","large discrepancies","limited resources","system","order","conditions","contact rate","people","complex problem","peak","costs","need","social distancing","current COVID","price of anarchy","main tools","spread","infection","level"],"language":"en"},

We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p\u003E0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of\u0022deceleration parameters\u0022may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.","publish_time":"2015-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viboud, C\u0027ecile; Simonsen, Lone; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb673172682791536469cf121f85966cf5e03b3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01389v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["Ebola","Liberia","Khulna","Uruguay","Japan","West African Ebola"],"keyphrases":["slow growth","Sub-exponential growth profiles","epidemic growth patterns","importance of sub-exponential growth","generalized-growth model","early growth dynamics","substantial growth variations","profile of slower growth","epidemic profiles","mouth disease outbreak","AIDS epidemic","Ebola outbreak","near exponential","disease forecasts","smallpox outbreak","different infectious disease outbreaks","West African Ebola epidemic","important drivers of disease transmission","empirical outbreak data","mean p","range of transmission routes","largest district-level outbreaks","existing mathematical transmission models","early onset of interventions strategies","risk groups","heterogeneity","reactive behavior changes","unique opportunity","contact structures","simulations","analysis","Uruguay","variety of viral pathogens","significant variation","consideration","geography","HIV","forecasting purposes","ascending phase","Japan","Liberia","better characterization","findings","common phenomenon","deceleration parameters","pandemic influenza","San Francisco","Bomi","foot","Khulna"],"language":"en"},

China, and subsequently, across the world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been asked by the public is\u0022Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?\u0022. While different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases, the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands. On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the patients\u0027 frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best medical outcome.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Grace; He, Wenqing; Lin, Dennis Kon-Jin; Yu, Chun-Ming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35d72224e5e468d67b6079c6ce0fcc9df4e01b87.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01252v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["limited resources","general public","COVID","scant resources","availability of resources","Public health officials","screening criteria","tough situation","best medical outcome","best outcome","hand","screening infected cases","evidence-based reasoning","medical personnel","infected patients","statistical angle","statistical viewpoint","stealth transmissions","new evidence","Undetected transmissions","swift spread","shortage of test kits","considerations","factoring","remarkable challenge","sensible evaluations","recommendations","physicians","inaccuracy","uncertainty","clinicians","dilemma","usage","anxieties","definition of PUI","investigation","coronavirus disease","containment","examination","unlimited demands","appalling threat","different regions","city of Wuhan","China","tests","patients\u0027 frustrations","beginning","development","issue","concerns","light","urgent question","paper","world"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}\u003C1$, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When $R_{0}\u003E1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Conghui; Yu, Yongguang; Yang, QuanChen; Lu, Zhenzhen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68b1aaf54cdad74b9b4095f253802a7a191a2ee6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12541v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIQRP","SEIQRPD"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["modified SEIQRP model","improved model","SEIQRPD model","trend of COVID","epidemic trend","United States","disease-free equilibrium point","generalized fractional-order SEIR model","endemic equilibrium points","weeks","development process of COVID","possible outbreak of infectious diseases","insect diseases","better prediction ability","basic guiding significance","basic reproduction number","local asymptotic stability of disease-free","government mitigation measurement","individual behavior","spread","paper","influence","real data","peak of isolated cases","future","important reference","qualitative properties","conditions"],"language":"en"},

The current gold standard test for screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray. Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A (1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763 non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19), respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and 184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model, which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for better outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Misra, Sampa; Jeon, Seungwan; Lee, Seiyon; Managuli, Ravi; Kim, Chulhong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10635018a1cc032cba39d259d86b6e7871d71f83.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05576v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening COVID","reading COVID","diagnosis of COVID","presentation of COVID","non-pneumonia","Dataset","challenge of reading chest X-rays","Non-COVID19","ResNet-based models","screening patients","single ResNet model","ResNet architecture","ensemble model","test kits","quick screening","current gold standard test","polymerase chain reaction test","multi-channel transfer learning model","relevant semantic features","radiologists","specialization","immediate triaging","treatment","better outcomes","clinicians","class","precision","results","method","novel coronavirus","use","alternative","cases","approach","recall","world","society"],"language":"en"},

In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus.

Based on an extended SEIR model and continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment (eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple\u0022flattening of the curve\u0022. Careful analysis of the resulting evolution of the time-dependent effective reproduction number reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kantner, Markus; Koprucki, Thomas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fd667eb2cd80cc9411699f37c5ad5b94be887a9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09471v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy","computed optimal control strategy","continuous-time optimal control theory","non-pharmaceutical interventions","model system","socio-economic costs","case","single-intervention scenario","available strategies","motivated interventions","time-dependent effective reproduction number reveals","effective medical treatment","extended SEIR model","paper","social distancing","home quarantine","far-reaching shutdown of public life","COVID","vaccination","resulting evolution","tightrope","sufficient degree of natural immunity","initial exponential growth phase","minimization of disease","eradication","complete containment","risk","competing requirements","obtained solution","stability boundary","order","related deaths","fact","measures","establishment","Careful analysis","vaccine","new outbreak","spread of epidemics","Germany","wave","curve","minimum"],"language":"en"},

This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like \u0027stress\u0027 which, unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset and the fact that \u0027healthcare worker\u0027 is a confounding variable, it is likely that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases the risk of COVID19. Indeed,\u0022being in close contact with COVID19 people\u0022reduces the risk of COVID19.

However, pure manual segmentation of CT images faces a serious challenge with the increase of suspected cases, resulting in urgent requirements for accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infections. Unfortunately, since the imaging characteristics of the COVID-19 infection are diverse and similar to the backgrounds, existing medical image segmentation methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance. In this work, we try to establish a new deep convolutional neural network tailored for segmenting the chest CT images with COVID-19 infections. We firstly maintain a large and new chest CT image dataset consisting of 165,667 annotated chest CT images from 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inspired by the observation that the boundary of the infected lung can be enhanced by adjusting the global intensity, in the proposed deep CNN, we introduce a feature variation block which adaptively adjusts the global properties of the features for segmenting COVID-19 infection. The proposed FV block can enhance the capability of feature representation effectively and adaptively for diverse cases. We fuse features at different scales by proposing Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to handle the sophisticated infection areas with diverse appearance and shapes. We conducted experiments on the data collected in China and Germany and show that the proposed deep CNN can produce impressive performance effectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Qingsen; Wang, Bo; Gong, Dong; Luo, Chuan; Zhao, Wei; Shen, Jianhu; Shi, Qinfeng; Jin, Shuo; Zhang, Liang; You, Zheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34e105872c774ec5f4d8c06f0c1b80b370cdc111.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10987v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","CNN"],"locations":["China","Germany"],"keyphrases":["segmenting COVID","confirmed COVID","automatic segmentation of COVID","annotated chest CT images","pure manual segmentation of CT images","proposed deep CNN","new chest CT image dataset","diverse cases","diverse appearance","features","proposed FV block","infections","sophisticated infection areas","feature variation block","existing medical image segmentation methods","new deep convolutional neural network","satisfactory performance","global properties","global intensity","impressive performance","increase of suspected cases","capability of feature representation","backgrounds","Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling","urgent requirements","serious challenge","patients","different scales","year","Computed Tomography","time-consuming RT-PCR test","world","end","crucial alternative","Germany","shapes","boundary","China","novel coronavirus disease","infected lung","various countries","imaging characteristics","observation","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where $T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic parameters.

We base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease, including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gershon, David; Lipton, Alexander; Levine, Hagai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f15c28001495afcf12754e6b59ecd03e5a18fd48.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10324v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total number of ICU beds","number of spare ICU beds","number of total","case of inadequate ICU beds","healthcare capacity","economy","total number of hospital","lack of ICU units","limited-time quarantine","inadequate capacity","healthcare system","limited period quarantine","specific high-risk groups","account different population groups","low-risk population groups","countries","functions of time","threshold","pandemic","model parameters","intensive care hospitalizations","intensive care unit","infection period","partial-quarantine scenarios outcomes","detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model","treatment","phases","disease","quantitative impact","incubation","data","deaths","million","reasonable hygienic measures","feedback loop","analysis","lockdowns","death curve","recent research papers","rest","COVID","main conclusion","country","approach"],"language":"en"},

Overall, our analysis pinpoints the need for further studies: 1) to better quantify olfaction and taste disturbances associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those of other viral and respiratory infections, 2) to understand the relation between smell, taste, and chemesthesis disturbances in COVID-19, and 3) to understand how persistent are these disturbances after the infection has resolved.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pellegrino, Robert; Cooper, Keiland W; Di Pizio, Antonella; Joseph, Paule V; Bhutani, Surabhi; Parma, Valentina","journal":"Chemical senses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407464/; https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjaa031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["taste disturbances","persistent chemosensory disturbances","novel COVID","chemesthesis disturbances","chemosensory symptomology","chemosensory ability","chemosensory evaluation","olfaction","review","SARS-CoV","anecdotal reports","evolving reports","association","past coronavirus pandemics","relationship","changes","screening tool","current evidence","manifestations","brief overview","social trends","true nature","smell","MERS","archived literature","parallels","analysis","need","studies","respiratory infections","topic","wealth","otolaryngological societies","goal"],"language":"en"},

Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus an ADP-receptor inhibitor (ticagrerol, prasugrel or clopidogrel) is recommended to reduce the risk of other platelet-mediated events. Clopidogrel is recommended in patients with Chronic Coronary Syndromes (CCS) or in ACS patients at high bleeding risk. Unfortunately, up to 30% of patients are non-responders to clopidogrel and show residual high platelet reactivity (HPR). Colchicine (COLC) is a drug with cardiovascular effects. We have demonstrated that COLC might exert protective cardiovascular effects by interfering with cytoskeleton rearrangement, a phenomenon involved in platelet aggregation. Here, we investigate in vitro the effects of colchicine on platelet aggregation of patients on DAPT with clopidogrel. Platelets obtained from 35 CCS patients on therapy with clopidogrel were pre-incubated with COLC 10 \u00B5M before being stimulated with ADP (20 \u00B5M), or TRAP (25 \u00B5M) at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min to measure max aggregation by LTA. Platelets not COLC-preincubated served as controls. Seven patients were pre-selected as clopidogrel non-responders. COLC significantly reduced TRAP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel responders and non-responders. Interestingly, COLC inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders in which ADP still caused activation despite DAPT. We demonstrate that COLC inhibits platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders with HPR despite DAPT with this ADP receptor-inhibitor. Further in vivo studies should be designed to evaluate the opportunity to prescribe colchicine after ACS/CCS to overcome the clopidogrel limitations in the DAPT therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cirillo, Plinio; Taglialatela, Vittorio; Pellegrino, Grazia; Morello, Andrea; Conte, Stefano; Di Serafino, Luigi; Cimmino, Giovanni","journal":"J Thromb Thrombolysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5b0e065f02dbf9847b8817bf210095ab9f1053a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183388.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02121-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","COLC","DAPT","CCS","ADP","LTA","ACS/CCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clopidogrel responders","clopidogrel non-responders","platelet aggregation of patients","clopidogrel limitations","Platelets aggregation","COLC inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation","ACS patients","CCS patients","max aggregation","reduced TRAP-induced platelet aggregation","DAPT therapy","platelet-mediated events","ADP-receptor inhibitor","ADP receptor-inhibitor","effects of colchicine","\u00B5M","residual high platelet reactivity","HPR","protective cardiovascular effects","Antiplatelet therapy","high bleeding risk","stent thrombosis","Chronic Coronary Syndromes","pathophysiology of acute coronary syndrome","pivotal role","cytoskeleton rearrangement","aspirin","ticagrerol","prasugrel","phenomenon","drug","activation","LTA","opportunity","controls","studies"],"language":"en"},

Here we used various imaging techniques to investigate the ultrastructural details of ZIKV RFs and their relationship with host cell organelles. Analyses of human hepatic cells and neural progenitor cells infected with ZIKV revealed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations containing pore-like openings toward the cytosol, reminiscent to RFs in Dengue virus-infected cells. Both the MR766 African strain and the H/PF/2013 Asian strain, the latter linked to neurological diseases, induce RFs of similar architecture. Importantly, ZIKV infection causes a drastic reorganization of microtubules and intermediate filaments forming cage-like structures surrounding the viral RF. Consistently, ZIKV replication is suppressed by cytoskeleton-targeting drugs. Thus, ZIKV RFs are tightly linked to rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cortese, Mirko; Goellner, Sarah; Acosta, Eliana Gisela; Neufeldt, Christopher John; Oleksiuk, Olga; Lampe, Marko; Haselmann, Uta; Funaya, Charlotta; Schieber, Nicole; Ronchi, Paolo; Schorb, Martin; Pruunsild, Priit; Schwab, Yannick; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/245785480707d85aedda479e48efebde1aee5ec1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f78f42cdcf23e60059e6ef785c1d72072824832a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/daff41630d6cdd363db1971c2a7ebb0414c58a96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5340982.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717301791; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124717301791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV replication","ZIKV infection","ultrastructural details of ZIKV RFs","Zika virus","Dengue virus-infected cells","RFs of similar architecture","host cell cytoskeleton","positive-strand RNA virus","neural progenitor cells","host cell organelles","Analyses of human hepatic cells","neurological diseases","Asian strain","severe neurological symptoms","membranous replication factories","MR766 African strain","endoplasmic reticulum","intermediate filaments","membrane invaginations","drastic reorganization of microtubules","infections","relationship","cage","openings","pore","PF","cytosol","pandemic","rearrangements","structures","adults","newborns","various imaging techniques","global concern","drugs"],"language":"en"},

Several potential pathogens such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus delphini have been studied, but the etiology of the syndrome seems complex. In pooled samples from 38 diarrheic and 42 non-diarrheic litters, each comprising of intestinal contents from 2\u20133 mink kits from the same litter, the bacterial populations were studied using Illumina Next Generation Sequencing technology and targeted 16S amplicon sequencing. In addition, we used deep sequencing to determine and compare the viral intestinal content in 31 healthy non-diarrheic and 30 diarrheic pooled samples (2\u20133 mink kits from the same litter per pool). The results showed high variations in composition of the bacterial species between the pools. Enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci dominated in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic pools. However, enterococci accounted for 70% of the reads in the diarrheic group compared to 50% in the non-diarrheic group and this increase was at the expense of staphylococci and streptococci which together accounted for 45% and 17% of the reads in the non-diarrheic and diarrheic group, respectively. Moreover, in the diarrheic pools there were more reads assigned to Clostridia, Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacter compared to the non-diarrheic pools. The taxonomically categorized sequences from the virome showed that the most prevalent viruses in all pools were caliciviruses and mamastroviruses (almost exclusively type 10). However, the numbers of reads assigned to caliciviruses were almost 3 times higher in the diarrheic pools compared the non-diarrheic pools and Sapporo-like caliciviruses were more abundant than the Norwalk-like caliciviruses.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients. The available therapeutic armamentarium (e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals) is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains; therefore, neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated HCMV infections in these patients. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mAb against HCMV from the immunological repertoire of immune donors. To this aim, we designed an efficient technology relying on two discrete and sequential steps: first, human B-lymphocytes are stimulated with TLR9-agonists and IL-2; second, after both additives are removed, the cells are infected with EBV. Using this strategy we obtained 29 clones secreting IgG neutralizing the HCMV infectivity; four among these were further characterized. All of the mAbs neutralize the infection in different combinations of HCMV strains and target cells, with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the HCMV hyperimmune globulins, currently used in transplant recipients. Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated. CONCLUSION: The technology described has proven to be more reproducible, efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques, and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mAbs for immunotherapeutic uses.","publish_time":"2008-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Funaro, Ada; Gribaudo, Giorgio; Luganini, Anna; Ortolan, Erika; Lo Buono, Nicola; Vicenzi, Elisa; Cassetta, Luca; Landolfo, Santo; Buick, Richard; Falciola, Luca; Murphy, Marianne; Garotta, Gianni; Malavasi, Fabio","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90662d7dc7b09e018829ae2bc13e167b218931d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2631500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014469/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-8-85","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human mAbs","HCMV infectivity","HCMV hyperimmune globulins","human B-lymphocytes","Human cytomegalovirus","Human monoclonal antibodies","different combinations of HCMV strains","re-activated HCMV infections","immune response","neutralizing mAb","Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable","therapeutic tool","effective therapeutic antibodies","transplant patients","efficient technology","available therapeutic armamentarium","resistant strains","target cells","immunological repertoire of immune donors","transplant recipients","prevention of primary","cell biology laboratory","development","serious pathogenic agent","clones secreting IgG","decisive alternative","low overall costs","emergence of drug","sequential steps","ubiquitous opportunistic virus","potency","clinical applications","study","case of infectious diseases","antivirals","BACKGROUND","TLR9-agonists","fold higher","immunotherapeutic uses","effects","strategy","reported techniques","RESULTS","purpose","aim","CONCLUSION","additives","EBV"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the human contact to hantaviruses carried by these hosts and to assess the public health relevance of hantaviruses for humans living in the tropical rainforest regions of Western and Central Africa, we performed a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the region of Ta\u00EF National Park in C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire and the Bandundu region near the Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic (DR) of Congo.

Seroprevalence rates of 3.9% (27/687) and 2.4% (7/295), respectively, were found in the investigated regions in C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire and the DR Congo. In C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire, this value was significantly higher than the seroprevalence rates previously reported from the neighboring country Guinea as well as from South Africa.

Although most such infections are viral in origin, it is difficult to differentiate bacterial and viral infections, as the clinical symptoms are similar. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods allow testing for multiple pathogens simultaneously and are, therefore, gaining interest. This prospective case-control study was conducted from October 2013 to February 2014. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were obtained from children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at a tertiary hospital. A control group of 40 asymptomatic children was included. Testing for 16 viruses was done by real-time multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR detected a viral pathogen in 159/177 (89.9 %) patients admitted with SARI. There was a high rate of co-infection (46.9 %). Dual detections were observed in 64 (36.2 %), triple detections in 17 (9.6 %), and quadruple detections in 2 (1.1 %) of 177 samples. Seventy-eight patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, of whom 28 (35.8 %) had co-infection with multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected among asymptomatic children. This study confirms the high rate of detection of viral nucleic acids by multiplex PCR among hospitalized children admitted with SARI, as well as the high rate of co-detection of multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected in asymptomatic children, resulting in challenges in clinical interpretation.

We have found that SARS-CoV enters cells via pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis. Treatment of cells with either SARS-CoV spike protein or spike-bearing pseudoviruses resulted in the translocation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, from the cell surface to endosomes. In addition, the spike-bearing pseudoviruses and early endosome antigen 1 were found to colocalize in endosomes. Further analyses using specific endocytic pathway inhibitors and dominant-negative Eps15 as well as caveolin-1 colocalization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism. Moreover, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways, were shown to be involved in virus entry. Endocytic entry of SARS-CoV may expand the cellular range of SARS-CoV infection, and our findings here contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, providing new information for anti-viral drug research.

Chloroplast genomes have been widely used for plant phylogenetic inference recently. The number of complete chloroplast genomes increases rapidly with the development of various genome sequencing projects. However, no comprehensive platform or tool has been developed for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes. Thus, we constructed a comprehensive platform for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes which was named as chloroplast genome analysis platform (CGAP). RESULTS: CGAP is an interactive web-based platform which was designed for the comparative analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. CGAP integrated genome collection, visualization, content comparison, phylogeny analysis and annotation functions together. CGAP implemented four web servers including creating complete and regional genome maps of high quality, comparing genome features, constructing phylogenetic trees using complete genome sequences, and annotating draft chloroplast genomes submitted by users. CONCLUSIONS: Both CGAP and source code are available at http://www.herbbol.org:8000/chloroplast. CGAP will facilitate the collection, visualization, comparison and annotation of complete chloroplast genomes. Users can customize the comparative and phylogenetic analysis using their own unpublished chloroplast genomes.","publish_time":"2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Jinkui; Zeng, Xu; Ren, Guomin; Liu, Zhihua","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3eb3c6212432888ecf0f2d3d2dc4a2fb6b4f17c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3636126.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23496817/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-95","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CGAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes","phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes","comparative analysis of complete chloroplast genomes","chloroplast genome analysis platform","annotation of complete chloroplast genomes","unpublished chloroplast genomes","number of complete chloroplast genomes","annotating draft chloroplast genomes","complete genome sequences","genome features","independent genome","CGAP integrated genome collection","phylogeny analysis","phylogenetic trees","comprehensive platform","plant phylogenetic inference","regional genome maps of high quality","development of various genome sequencing projects","visualization","interactive web-based platform","users","content comparison","annotation functions","web servers","essential organelle","plants","source code","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","tool"],"language":"en"},

The virus was ultimately named Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and has been endemic in Saudi Arabia since 2012. As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization. An imported case of MERS occurred in South Korea in 2015, stimulating a multi-month outbreak. Several distinguishing factors emerge upon epidemiological and sociological analysis of the two outbreaks including public awareness of the MERS outbreak, and transmission and synchronization of governing healthcare bodies. South Korea implemented a stringent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information. In addition, many details about MERS-CoV virology, transmission, pathological progression, and even the reservoir, remain unknown. This paper aims to delineate the key differences between the two regional outbreaks from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices, information and public knowledge, cultural practices, and reservoirs, among others.

One trained observer recorded the healthcare activities performed, contacts with fomites, and self-contacts made by healthcare workers (HCWs), while another observer recorded fomite contacts of patients during the encounter using predefined checklists. RESULTS: The surface contacted by HCWs during the majority of visits was the patient (90%). Environmental surfaces contacted by HCWs frequently during healthcare activities included the tray table (48%), bed surface (41%), bed rail (41%), computer station (37%), and intravenous pole (32%). HCWs touched their own torso and mask in 32% and 29% of the visits, respectively.

When HCWs performed only 1 care activity, there were significant differences in the number of patient contacts and self-contacts that HCWs made during performance of multiple care activities (P \u003C .05). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs regularly contact environmental surfaces, patients, and themselves while providing care to patients with infectious diseases, varying among care activities and HCW job roles. These contacts may facilitate the transmission of infection to HCWs and susceptible patients.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phan, Linh T; Maita, Dayana; Mortiz, Donna C; Bleasdale, Susan C; Jones, Rachael M","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e489f92a7fda5ea493642945b61c85b6bde8a76e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6761362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCWs","self-contacts","fomite contacts of patients","number of patient contacts","care activity","healthcare activities","susceptible patients","performance of multiple care activities","hospitalized patients","fomites","acute care academic medical center","HCW job roles","respiratory therapists","patient room","healthcare workers","Respiratory viruses","Environmental surfaces","bed surface","viral respiratory infections","sites susceptible","transmission of infection","trained observer","majority of visits","bed rail","hour periods","significant differences","times","providers","encounter","infectious diseases","nurses","nurse technicians","hands","tray table","predefined checklists","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","year period","torso","mask","RESULTS","computer station","intravenous pole"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in 23 French ICUs during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Levels of PCT at admission were compared between patients with confirmed influenzae A pneumonia associated or not associated with a bacterial co-infection. RESULTS: Of 103 patients with confirmed A/H1N1 infection and not having received prior antibiotics, 48 (46.6%; 95% CI 37\u201356%) had a documented bacterial co-infection, mostly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (54%) or Staphylococcus aureus (31%). Fifty-two patients had PCT measured on admission, including 19 (37%) having bacterial co-infection. Median (range 25\u201375%) values of PCT were significantly higher in patients with bacterial co-infection: 29.5 (3.9\u201345.3) versus 0.5 (0.12\u20132) \u03BCg/l (P \u003C 0.01).

However, their etiological pattern and clinical impact remains inconclusive. METHODS: Eight hundred forty-six consecutive children with CAP were evaluated prospectively for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were examined by direct immunofluorescence assay or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viruses. PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to detect M. pneumoniae. Bacteria was detected in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, or pleural fluid by culture. RESULTS: Causative pathogen was identified in 70.1% (593 of 846) of the patients. The most commonly detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.9%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (22.1%), M. pneumoniae (15.8%).

In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR) assay targeting the ORF3 of PEDV was developed to distinguish PEDV field strains from attenuated strains by using a specific pair of primers. The PCR products of field strains and attenuated strains were 264 bp and 215 bp in length, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were also assessed. The nanoparticle-assisted RT-PCR assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay, with no cross-reactions when amplifying porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine rotavirus (RV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).

Infections caused by human coronaviruses (hCoVs) are mostly associated with the respiratory, enteric, and nervous systems. The hCoVs only occasionally induce lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. In 2002 to 2003, a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the seminal detection of a novel CoV (SARS-CoV). A decade later (June 2012), another novel CoV was implicated as the cause of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia. Although bats might serve as a reservoir of MERS-CoV, it is unlikely that they are the direct source for most human cases. Severe lines of evidence suggest that dromedary camels have been the major cause of transmission to humans. The emergence of MERS-CoV has triggered serious concerns about the potential for a widespread outbreak. All MERS cases were linked directly or indirectly to the Middle East region including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and UAE. MERS cases have also been reported in the later phases in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Tunisia. Most of these MERS cases were linked with the Middle East. The high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based outbreaks were reported among patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure. MERS-CoV causes an acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction. The major complications reported in fatal cases are hyperkalemia with associated ventricular tachycardia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pericarditis, and multiorgan failure. The case-fatality rate seems to be higher for MERS-CoV (around 30%) than for SARS-CoV (9.6%). The combination regimen of type 1 interferon \u002B lopinavir/ritonavir is considered as the first-line therapy for MERS. Antiviral treatment is generally recommended for 10 to 14 days in patients with MERS-CoV infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has shown some efficacy among patients refractory to antiviral drugs if administered within 2 weeks of the onset of the disease.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Sunit K.","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b69353a7338ec3fe6c9e5fdfda059b3016762620.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27486737/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1584796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","France","Germany","Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["MERS cases","MERS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV","novel CoV","reservoir of MERS","emergence of MERS","human cases","fatal cases","cause of Middle East respiratory syndrome","Middle East region","global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Saudi Arabia","lower respiratory tract disease","patients refractory","renal failure","human coronaviruses","hCoVs","humans","major cause of transmission","major complications","antiviral drugs","lethal pneumonia","multiorgan failure","renal dysfunction","widespread outbreak","line therapy","later phases","Antiviral treatment","associated ventricular tachycardia","Severe lines of evidence","hospital-based outbreaks","Convalescent plasma therapy","efficacy","Jordan","intravascular coagulation","France","hyperkalemia","bronchitis","United Kingdom","dromedary camels","enveloped RNA viruses","interferon","Italy","Germany","family","birds","Oman","pericarditis","Qatar","comorbidities","seminal detection","serious concerns","combination regimen of type","lopinavir","Spain","Kuwait","mammals","potential","weeks","bronchiolitis","direct source","diabetes","high mortality rates","ritonavir","case-fatality rate","nervous systems","Infections","days","Tunisia","UAE","onset","bats","decade"],"language":"en"},

The presence of two distinct membrane topologies of the SARS-CoV E protein may provide a useful clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2006-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Q.; Liao, Y.; Torres, J.; Tam, J.P.; Liu, D.X.","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f40702e4fe670477663f60a748e55dcd521722b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094218.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579306005333; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579306005333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Asn"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV E protein","N-terminus","C-terminus","small integral membrane protein","pathogenesis of SARS","C-termini","membranes","cyto","Different coronavirus E proteins","distinct membrane topology","distinct membrane topologies","N-linked glycosylation","multi-functions","biological functions","Coronavirus envelope","infectious bronchitis virus","striking similarities","morphogenesis","virion assembly","biochemical properties","immunofluorescent staining of cells","useful clue","detergents","IBV","lum","exo","proteinase","Asn","parallel experiments","host interaction","minor proportion","protection assay","presence","contrast","report"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines have been used to protect against ARD; however, these are not always available or effective. METHODS: The medical literature (1963\u20132004) on preventive nonvaccine ARD interventions (NOVARDIs) for infectious diseases, which addressed personal measures, administrative controls, and engineering controls, was studied during 2000 to 2004. Population-based studies in community settings (non-health care) were reviewed in detail to evaluate the effectiveness of NOVARDIs. Budgetary and logistic factors as well as acceptance were considered in formulating recommendations for implementation of NOVARDIs in military training centers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight population-based studies contained in 35 publications were examined. Three studies contained information on multiple NOVARDIs. Nine studies supported the use of personal measures relating to hand hygiene. Ten studies supported administrative controls such as cohorting military training units to reduce contact between units (4 studies), providing adequate personal space to reduce crowding (5), and cloth barriers between beds (1); and 14 studies supported the use of engineering controls such as increased indoor air dilution and ventilation (2), dust suppression (4), and air sterilization (8). CONCLUSIONS: Promoting hand hygiene and reducing crowding through the provision of adequate living space and cohorting of training units may offer benefits in respiratory disease control. These interventions, along with UV lights and air dilution/ventilation, deserve further evaluation in controlled studies to assess their efficacy. NOVARDIs could benefit military and other populations living in close contact.","publish_time":"2005-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Terrence; Jordan, Nikki N.; Sanchez, Jose L.; Gaydos, Joel C.","journal":"Am J Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135187.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379704003630; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379704003630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["controlled studies","Population-based studies","military training centers","cohorting military training units","cohorting of training units","administrative controls","implementation of NOVARDIs","multiple NOVARDIs","effectiveness of NOVARDIs","use of engineering controls","adequate personal space","use of personal measures","ventilation","crowding","provision of adequate living space","hand hygiene","air sterilization","Infectious acute respiratory disease","increased indoor air dilution","preventive nonvaccine ARD interventions","respiratory disease control","infectious diseases","close contact","community settings","school dormitories","benefits","non-health care","UV lights","formulating recommendations","significant cause of worldwide morbidity","individuals","acceptance","INTRODUCTION","evaluation","populations","correctional facilities","logistic factors","RESULTS","information","cloth barriers","crowded conditions","dust suppression","METHODS","medical literature","beds","CONCLUSIONS","efficacy","publications","Vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Animals: Sixty Pugs with NME and 14 contemporaneous control Pugs with other intracranial diseases (non\u2010NME group). Methods: Pugs that were euthanized or died because of intracranial disease were prospectively obtained. All dogs had necropsy, histopathology, and testing for various infectious diseases and were subsequently divided into NME and non\u2010NME groups. Signalment, geographic distribution, seasonal onset, treatment, and survival were compared between groups. Results: In Pugs with NME, median age at onset of clinical signs was 18 months (range, 4\u2013113 months). A greater proportion of female dogs were present in the NME group (40/60) compared with the control group (6/14). Pugs with NME had a significantly lower mean weight (7.81 kg) than control Pugs (9.79 kg) (P= .012). Mean survival in Pugs with NME was 93 days (range, 1\u2013680 days), with dogs receiving any form of treatment living significantly longer than those that were not treated (P= .003). Anticonvulsive drugs were the only treatment significantly associated with longer survival (P= .003). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: NME appears to be a common cause of intracranial signs in Pugs, based on the high proportion of NME dogs reported in this population. Pugs with NME are most commonly young adult female dogs. Although further investigation is needed to determine the optimal treatment of NME, anticonvulsive drugs appear to beneficially affect duration of survival.","publish_time":"2008-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levine, J.M.; Fosgate, G.T.; Porter, B.; Schatzberg, S.J.; Greer, K.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/868fcd701b2f8669b51b669d187d4210f475c292.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166975.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0137.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18647157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal treatment of NME","non\u2010NME groups","high proportion of NME dogs","contemporaneous control Pugs","survival of affected dogs","Mean survival","longer survival","form of treatment","duration of survival","control group","greater proportion of female dogs","seasonal onset","intracranial diseases","young adult female dogs","onset of clinical signs","signalment","geographic distribution","range","Anticonvulsive drugs","months","days","common cause of intracranial signs","Clinical Importance","various infectious diseases","lower mean weight","median age","testing","histopathology","histopathologic features of necrotizing meningoencephalitis","little information","necropsy","Conclusions","Background","population","Animals","Results","investigation","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Most of the published virological surveys are based on the first described Real-Time PCR method, designed on the PB1 gene of the first isolate. The necessity of extending investigation to different animal species and geographic areas, requires a continuous update of molecular tests, considering newly sequenced strains. Moreover, the availability of an alternative assay, is essential either to confirm data, or for ensuring the detection of the widest number of strains. A new Real-Time PCR, specific for influenza D virus (IDV), was developed and evaluated. The target sequences of primers and probe are highly conserved among IDV strains currently known. The specificity of the method was demonstrated in silico by BLAST, and in vitro with a huge panel of common swine and bovine respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR was estimated through synthetic RNA molecules and the limit of detection was about 20 copies/\u03BCL. The assay was assessed in field and proved to be a valuable tool for the detection of IDV strains.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faccini, Silvia; De Mattia, Aurora; Chiapponi, Chiara; Barbieri, Ilaria; Boniotti, Maria Beatrice; Rosignoli, Carlo; Franzini, Giuliana; Moreno, Ana; Foni, Emanuela; Nigrelli, Arrigo Daniele","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31130f918b672de11184f7764d6147993f838b02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113724.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.01.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416304633; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416304633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of IDV strains","Real-Time PCR method","sequenced strains","new Real-Time PCR","limit of detection","widest number of strains","influenza D virus","occurrence of virus","alternative assay","putative genus Influenzavirus D","geographic areas","probe","different animal species","huge panel of common swine","synthetic RNA molecules","investigation","bovine respiratory pathogens","continuous update of molecular tests","world arousing","valuable tool","PB1 gene","target sequences of primers","scientific community","necessity","BLAST","copies","analytical sensitivity","published virological surveys","isolate","availability","field","silico","data","\u03BCL","specificity"],"language":"en"},

We have previously used this method to detect HSV1, GBV-C, and measles virus sequence in brain tissue from deceased donors. Deep sequencing was performed on brain specimens from a cohort of patients who died with progressive forms of MS, revealing evidence of increased expression of some human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) domains. OBJECTIVES: Identify RNA sequences and new antigens involved in the pathogenesis of MS METHODS: Deep sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from 12 progressive MS, 2 neuromyelitis optica (MS/NMO = demyelination group), 14 normal control, and 7 other neurologic disease (OND) control frozen brain specimens. The resulting single-ended 50 bp sequences (reads) were compared to a non redundant viral database representing (NRVDB) all 1.2 M viral records in GenBank. A retroviral gene catalog (RVGC) was prepared by identifying human genetic loci (GRCh37.p13) homologous to domains contained in the Gypsy 2.0 retro element database. Reads were aligned to the RVGC and human transcriptome with Bowtie2. The resulting viral hit rates (VHRs) were normalized by the number of high quality reads. The expression of human genes, including HERVs, was determined using Cufflinks. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the false discovery rate. RESULTS: Fifty to 131 million high quality reads per specimen were obtained. Comparison of the reads to the NRVDB suggested that the demyelination and OND specimens had higher VHRs against some retroviral sequences compared with the controls. This was confirmed by retroviral domain averaging. Gene expression analysis showed differential expression among some HERV sequences. Single read mapping revealed one envelope and one reverse transcriptase sequence record that were significantly enriched among the demyelination samples compared to the normal controls. Less restrictive (comprehensive) read mapping showed that 2 integrase, 2 core, 2 envelope, and 3 KRAB sequences that were overexpressed in the demyelination group. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that some endogenous retroviral sequences are significantly overexpressed in these demyelination brain tissue specimens, but the magnitude of this overexpression is small.

Reverse transcription of mRNA isolated from E. coli containing the run of 11 A\u0027s reveals heterogeneity of transcript length while reverse transcription of mRNA isolated from S. cerevisiae containing the same gene shows no heterogeneity. Protein sequencing of the beta-galactosidase molecules derived from the out-of-frame construct containing a run of adenines reveals the addition of a lysine at the run. A new method was developed where messages small enough to allow resolution of single nucleotide differences on an acrylamide gel are electrophoresed, electroblotted onto nylon and probed. This confirmed the reverse transcription results and showed that additional residues can be added to transcripts derived from DNA containing 10 or 11 thymine residues. A mechanism for slippage is discussed where the A-U rich RNA-DNA hybrid can denature during elongation and rehybridize in an offset position, causing the addition of extra residues to the transcript.","publish_time":"1990-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wagner, L A; Weiss, R B; Driscoll, R; Dunn, D S; Gesteland, R F","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC331007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["run of guanine residues","thymine residues","run of adenines","additional residues","Reverse transcription of mRNA","addition of extra residues","reverse transcription results","coli","beta-galactosidase molecules","frame lacZ gene","A\u0027s reveals heterogeneity of transcript length","galactosidase expression","frame construct","high level of beta","U rich RNA-DNA hybrid","resolution of single nucleotide differences","messages small","acrylamide gel","elongation","offset position","Protein sequencing","new method","transcripts","lysine","cerevisiae","end","mechanism","slippage","nylon","effect"],"language":"en"},

A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. OBJECTIVES To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. RECOMMENDATIONS A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chawla, Deepak; Chirla, Dinesh; Dalwai, Samir; Deorari, Ashok K; Ganatra, Atul; Gandhi, Alpesh; Kabra, Nandkishor S; Kumar, Praveen; Mittal, Pratima; Parekh, Bakul Jayant; Sankar, M Jeeva; Singhal, Tanu; Sivanandan, Sindhu; Tank, Parikshit","journal":"Indian pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Guideline Development Group","GDG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical care","diagnosis of infection","neonatal care","recommendations","infection control","clinical trials","clinical suspicion","confirmed COVID","prevention of transmission","postnatal period","list of questions","practice questions","general questions","pregnant women","labor","special resources","special vulnerable group","evolving pandemic of COVID","resuscitation","wider group of clinicians","GDG","Perinatal period","Guideline Development Group","narrative reviews","systematic reviews","evidence profiles","travel history","mother-baby dyads","websites of relevant international","newborn infants","PubMed","unique challenges","national professional organizations","Existing guidelines","following broad headings","World Health Organization","surgical problems","obstetricians","immediate attention","GRADE approach","descriptive reports","neonatologists","values","JUSTIFICATION","preferences","Literature search","pediatricians","pregnancies","childbirths","context","OBJECTIVES","set","e-survey"],"language":"en"},

Qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals.","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32395789","license":"unk","abstract":"CONTEXT The Maghreb Central, like all the countries of the world, was strongly mobilized (governments, ministries of health, population, civil society) in the response against COVID-19, immediately after the registration of the first cases on its territory (end of February, beginning of March) and according to pre-established control strategies. OBJECTIVES Describe the perceptions of health professionals in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) as to the Strengths/Opportunities and Weaknesses/Threats of the national response plans against COVID-19, during the first weeks of their execution, and report their proposals for optimizing the performance of control strategies. METHODS This is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals in the Maghreb Central regarding their experience of the first six weeks of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected using the \u0022Delphi\u0022 technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as \u0022Google Form\u0022, developed according to SWOT analysis. The respondents\u0027 verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured. RESULTS A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years. The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe. The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics. CONCLUSION The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Yahia, Faten; Ben Abdelaziz, Asma; Barhoumi, Tarek; Quessar, Asmaa; Ben Salem, Kamel","journal":"La Tunisie medicale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Maghreb","Algeria","Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Central Maghreb","Maghreb response strategies","Maghreb Central participated","COVID","perceptions of health professionals","ministries of health","commitment of health professionals","national health systems","national response plans","development of health personnel","steering committees of response","performance of control strategies","general population","years","pre-established control strategies","weeks","loyalty of civil society","qualitative study","electronic form","median age","Google Form","possible epidemics","new epidemics","median professional tenure","mobilization","Threats","low support","Weaknesses","recommendations","community participation","chronic fragility","Tunisia","Asia","doctors","biologists","Strengths","turn","human resources","Morocco","governments","capacity","success","Algeria","launch of assistant motivation programs","pandemics","major force","homogeneous groups of items","international epidemiological expertise","cases","Delphi","occurrence","Opportunities","proposals","CONCLUSION","countries","OBJECTIVES","experience","territory","technique","respondents\u0027","Europe","nurses","world","execution","METHODS","total","CONTEXT","SWOT analysis","registration","data","fight"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The clinical data of 3 pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 19 to February 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS There was one case in the first-trimester pregnancy (case 1), one in the second-trimester pregnancy (case 2) and one in third-trimester pregnancy (case 3). Cough, fever, fatigue, lung imaging changes were the main manifestations. The white cell count, lymphocyte percentage had no significantly changes in case 1 and case 3, while the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IL-6 and IL-10 elevated. The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage decreased and the inflammatory indicators significantly increased in case 2. All patients were treated with antiviral, antitussive, oxygen inhalation; case 3 received glucocorticoids, case 2 with severe illness received glucocorticoids and additionally gamma globulin. All three cases were cured and discharged. Case 1 with early pregnancy chose to terminate pregnancy after discharge; case 2 chose to continue pregnancy without obstetric complications; and case 3 had cesarean section delivery due to abnormal fetal heart monitoring.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020. RESULTS Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 in children aged \u003C18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged \u003C18 years.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hua-Ping; Li, Bing-Fei; Chen, Xiao; Hu, Hua-Zhu; Jiang, Shu-Ai; Cheng, Hao; Hu, Xin-He; Tang, Jian-Xin; Zhong, Fu-Chu; Zeng, Ling-Wen; Yu, Wei; Yuan, Yan; Wu, Xian-Fei; Li, Yu-Ping; Zheng, Zong-Li; Pan, Tian-Bo; Wu, Zhi-Xing; Yuan, Jin-Feng; Chen, Qiang","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434634/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["children","years","diagnosis of COVID","CONCLUSIONS COVID","increase","reduction","family aggregation","days","months","lungs","mild type","fever","cough","clinical features of coronavirus disease","disease onset","mild symptoms","common type","nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS","virus nucleic acid negative conversion","specific clinical manifestation","laboratory examination results","particular importance","patchy ground-glass opacities","total leukocyte count","retrospective analysis","Abnormal pulmonary CT findings","good prognosis","medical data","C-reactive protein","Epidemiological history","METHODS","wet rales","D-dimer","period","OBJECTIVE","lymphocytes","Jiangxi","China","antiviral therapy","asymptomatic infection"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The EMG signals for the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and vastus medialis (VM) as well as times to exhaustion (Tlim) were recorded in ten runners during two exhaustive treadmill runs (SIZ1 and SIZ2). The composite and individual responses were compared among muscles and between intensities. RESULTS The composite patterns of responses in EMG AMP (linear, quadratic, and cubic increases; r2/R2=0.684-0.848) and EMG MPF (linear, quadratic, and cubic decreases; r2/R2=0.648 - 0.852) for the VL and RF were consistent with neuromuscular fatigue in both zones, but those for the VM were not (quadratic, cubic, and non-significant relationships with responses near baseline). The RF tended to demonstrate greater fatigue (EMG MPF decreased from 80-100% Tlim). There was large inter-individual variability (only 10-60% of responses consistent with composite) in response to fatiguing treadmill running.

The aim of this review was to systematically review studies examining the efficacy and tolerability of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders among older adults. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to English-language articles. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine for randomized controlled trials. RESULTS A total of 8,785 citations were retrieved and pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 3,753. This set was uploaded to Covidence for screening. Two separate screeners (AG and SAF) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the eligible articles. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, benzodiazepines were associated with decreased anxiety at the end of the study period. The limited tolerability data show mild adverse effects from the benzodiazepines studied. Limitations of the trials included limited data on the long-term use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and a preponderance of trials examining generalized anxiety disorder, with relatively less data on other anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS Benzodiazepines are effective for treating anxiety disorders in late life, at least in the short term, but more data is needed to establish tolerability and their long-term benefits.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Aarti; Bhattacharya, Gargi; Farheen, Syeda Arshiya; Funaro, Melissa; Balasubramaniam, Meera; Young, Juan; Tampi, Deena J; Tampi, Rajesh R","journal":"Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine","SAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tolerability of benzodiazepines","treatment of anxiety disorders","decreased anxiety","limited data","limited tolerability data","quality data","CONCLUSIONS Benzodiazepines","BACKGROUND Benzodiazepines","generalized anxiety disorder","long-term use of benzodiazepines","studies","preponderance of trials","randomized controlled trials","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","older adults","Ovid Embase","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","Ovid MEDLINE","long-term benefits","inclusion criteria","study period","eligible articles","English-language articles","Web of Science","Evidence-Based Medicine","PubMed","mild adverse effects","SAF","late life","titles","text","Centre","dearth of good","short term","prescribed medication","EndNote","separate screeners","abstracts","METHODS","authors","subject","efficacy","Limitations","citations","set","Covidence","screening","searches","total","aim"],"language":"en"},

Several factors increase the risk of respiratory infections in cancer patients.

In the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lung disease, it is important to distinguish pneumonia as an infectious disorder. Immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs)have been widely introduced to treat several types of malignancies. It is currently believed that ICIs do not increase the risk of infections. However, immune-related adverse events(irAEs)induced by ICIs may necessitate the administration of immunosuppressive agents, which could cause opportunistic infections. Furthermore, several reports describe reactivation tuberculosis without irAEs or immunosuppressants. Further studies are needed to prevent the development of tuberculosis in patients receiving ICIs.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Honda, Yoshihiro","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In this study, cellular protein response to TGEV infection in swine testes (ST) cells was analyzed, using the proteomic method of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) coupled with MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS identification. RESULTS: 33 differentially expressed protein spots, of which 23 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated were identified. All the protein spots were successfully identified. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and the mitochondrial pathway. Western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of alpha tubulin, keratin 19, and prohibitin during TGEV infection. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we have performed the first analysis of the proteomic changes in host cell during TGEV infection. 17 altered cellular proteins that differentially expressed in TGEV infection were identified.

SHIP has previously been shown to play a pivotal role in limiting the number of immunoregulatory cells and their function. AIM: To determine whether SHIP plays a pivotal role in control of immune tolerance in the gut mucosa. METHODS: Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. Gastrointestinal pathology was analysed in SHIP-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT haematopoietic cell grafts, and WT hosts reconstituted with SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts including whole splenocytes, purified T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Major immune cell populations were also analysed in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice and WT controls. RESULTS: SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis that recapitulated classical features of Crohn\u0027s disease enteric pathology. Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras showed that WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP(\u2212/\u2212) hosts corrects ileitis. Reconstitution with SHIP(\u2212/\u2212) splenocytes transferred ileitis to WT hosts. Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP(\u2212/\u2212) T cells or NK cells to WT hosts did not transfer ileitis. There was a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice; however, neutrophil numbers were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: SHIP plays a pivotal role in immune function in the intestine; further scrutiny of this pathway in IBD patients is warranted. It is proposed that SHIP-deficient ileitis results from a local deficit in mucosal T cell immunity that promotes a damaging granulocyte\u2013monocyte inflammation of the distal ileum.","publish_time":"2010-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerr, William G; Park, Mi-Young; Maubert, Monique; Engelman, Robert W","journal":"Gut","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cf33ae7aecff3052d051eefe7f4d26287c0217d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3022365.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20940287/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2009.202283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SHIP-deficient hosts","SHIP-deficient mice","SHIP-deficient ileitis results","SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts","WT hosts","small intestine of SHIP","small intestines of SHIP","separate strains of SHIP","WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP","Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP","WT haematopoietic cell grafts","WT controls","NK cells","CD8 T cells","immune function","pivotal role","mucosal T cell immunity","Major immune cell populations","number of immunoregulatory cells","immune regulation","Gastrointestinal pathology","intestinal epithelial cell integrity","splenocytes","control of immune tolerance","Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras","classical features of Crohn\u0027s disease enteric pathology","IBD patients","Inflammatory bowel disease","local deficit","transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis","damaging granulocyte","genetic mutations","respective wild-type","natural killer","monocyte inflammation","scrutiny","BACKGROUND","pathway","CD4","distal ileum","gut mucosa","paucity","littermates","neutrophil numbers","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","AIM"],"language":"en"},

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients\u0027 positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19\u0027s highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dover, Jeffrey S; Moran, Mary Lynn; Figueroa, Jose F; Furnas, Heather; Vyas, Jatin M; Wiviott, Lory D; Karchmer, Adolf W","journal":"Facial plastic surgery \u0026 aesthetic medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362134/; https://doi.org/10.1089/abc.2020.0239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Facial Plastic Surgery and Plastic Surgery"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["aesthetic care","Guidance Supplement","aesthetic physicians","Aesthetic providers","patient care","medical aesthetic specialties","aesthetic medical settings","health care practitioners","aesthetic medicine physicians","safety considerations","routine care","expert care","standards of care","non-surgical aesthetic treatments","traditional aesthetic office safety precautions","Public Health Policy","public health agencies","public health conditions","office environment","elective procedures","actionable risk-mitigation considerations","risk of infection","risk of infectious processes","new world of COVID","certain non-surgical procedures","healthy patients","elective treatment environment","professional medical societies","staffs","additional set of practical considerations","general office comportment","individual healthcare professional","Facial Plastic Surgery","elevated safety profile","fields of Infectious Disease","patient situation","practical guide","essential treatment","advisories applicable","number of areas","applicable law","local governmental authorities","government stay-at-home orders","local legal status","healthcare systems transition","disturbing number of young","Dermatology","staffing constraints","reduced tolerance","stroke","testing availability","doctoral experts","extremis","equipment","procedure details","unique challenges","Immunology","clinic preparedness","renal failure","multi-disciplinary panel of board-certified physician","sense of well-being","high quality","neurologic deficits","ultimate judgment","related commercial limitations","pre-existing morbidities","pericarditis","state","return","pernicious effects","life-threatening complications","variable presentation","unpredictable course","patients\u0027 positive self-image","practice","partnership","services","business","stressful period of quarantine","work phase","greatest extent","Project AesCert","advanced age","activity","economy","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

These are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 coterminal since they are composed of a leader and a body sequence, which are identical to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome, respectively. Previously, it has been suggested thatcis-splicing of a genome-length precursor RNA is involved in their synthesis. This was reevaluated in a comparative analysis of the sg RNA synthesis of EAV, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the alphavirus Sindbis virus. UV transcription mapping showed that the majority of the EAV sg RNAs made at later stages of infection is not derived from a genome-length precursor. However, complete independence of sg RNA synthesis from that of genomic RNA was never observed during the course of infection. The possibility that this resulted from UV irradiation-induced effects on the synthesis of the viral replicase was investigated by inhibiting translation using cycloheximide. For EAV, ongoing protein synthesis was found to be more important for the synthesis of sg RNA than for that of genomic RNA. In general, MHV transcription was extremely sensitive to translation inhibition, whereas EAV genomic RNA synthesis became independent ofde novoprotein synthesis late in infection.","publish_time":"1995-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"DEN BOON, JOHAN A.; SPAAN, WILLY J.M.; SNIJDER, ERIC J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04c9a90c7714882a22670cb77fdcda1c42b575e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285700098; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285700098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesis of sg RNA","sg RNA synthesis of EAV","EAV genomic RNA synthesis","complete independence of sg RNA synthesis","EAV sg RNAs","ongoing protein synthesis","genome-length precursor RNA","independent ofde novoprotein synthesis","MHV transcription","course of infection","alphavirus Sindbis virus","later stages of infection","UV transcription mapping","translation inhibition","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","genetic information of equine arteritis virus","UV irradiation-induced effects","majority","comparative analysis","viral replicase","body sequence","expression","subgenomic","arterivirus","leader","possibility","mRNAs","cycloheximide","thatcis","coterminal"],"language":"en"},

Accurate determination of the dimer dissociation constant and the role of the N-finger (residues 1\u20137) will provide more insights into the enzyme catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase. The dimer dissociation constant of the wild-type protein was determined to be 14.0\u03BCM by analytical ultracentrifugation method. The N-finger fragment of the enzyme plays an important role in enzyme dimerization as shown in the crystal structure. Key residues in the N-finger have been studied by site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme assay, and analytical ultracentrifugation. A single mutation of M6A was found to be critical to maintain the dimer structure of the enzyme. The N-terminal octapeptide N8 and its mutants were also synthesized and tested for their potency as dimerization inhibitors. Peptide cleavage assay confirms that peptide N8 is a dimerization inhibitor with a K i of 2.20mM. The comparison of the inhibitory activities of N8 and its mutants indicates that the hydrophobic interaction of Met-6 and the electrostatic interaction of Arg-4 contribute most for inhibitor binding.

This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factor\u03B1 (TNF\u03B1) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. RESULTS: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNF\u03B1 blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNF\u03B1 agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; George, Gincy; Santaolalla, Aida; Cope, Andrew; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke","journal":"Ecancermedicalscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/188f3e97042155ac1709aa8b74c0755760c3b50d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32256705/; https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","JAK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","context of COVID","modulation of COVID","clear evidence","specific cytotoxic drugs","current evidence","definitive evidence","conclusive evidence","specific studies","TNF\u03B1 blockade","beneficial impact of IL","unwell patients","transplant patients","JAK kinase inhibitors","cytotoxic chemotherapy","immune-suppressive","low-dose steroids","low-dose methotrexate","Low-dose prednisolone","NSAIDs","tacrolimus","anti-TNF\u03B1 agents","use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","auto-immune disease","specific inhibitor","pre-clinical studies","JAK-STAT pathway","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Janus kinase","anti-CD20","beneficial impacts","fatal respiratory diseases","mycophenolate mofetil picture","tumour necrosis factor\u03B1","blockers","secretion of cytokines","conflicting data","peak levels","pro-inflammatory cytokine generation","challenging decision-making","effects","Ovid MEDLINE","pandemic","interlukin","Cancer","host immunity","CTLA4-Ig","potential targets","higher risk","severity of pulmonary complications","BACKGROUND","coronaviruses","role","METHODS","CONCLUSION","review","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The difference map between the two structures reveals a novel large globular domain of VP4 buried within the virion that interacts extensively with the intermediate shell protein, VP6.

Methods The HPS was positioned at 45\u00B0 on the bed and programmed to mimic mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H2O). Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) started at 10 cm H2O and gradually increased to 18 cm H2O, whereas expiratory pressure was maintained at 4 cm H2O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet, and images were captured by high definition video. Normalized exhaled air concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. Findings As IPAP increased from 10 to 18 cm H2O, the exhaled air of a low normalized concentration through the ComfortFull 2 mask (Respironics) increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the median sagittal plane. When the IPAP of 10 cm H2O was applied via the Image 3 mask (Respironics) connected to the whisper swivel, the exhaled air dispersed to 0.95 m toward the end of the bed along the median sagittal plane, whereas higher IPAP resulted in wider spread of a higher concentration of smoke.

JEV-induced neuroinflammation is characterized by profound neuronal cells damage accompanied by activation of glial cells. Albeit long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been emerged as important regulatory RNAs with profound effects on various biological processes, it is unknown how lncRNAs regulate JEV-induced inflammation. Here, using microarray approach, we identified 618 lncRNAs and 1,007 mRNAs differentially expressed in JEV-infected mice brain. The functional annotation analysis revealed that differentially regulated transcripts were predominantly involved in various signaling pathways related to host immune and inflammatory responses. The lncRNAs with their potential to regulate JEV-induced inflammatory response were identified by constructing the lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network. Furthermore, silencing of the two selected lncRNAs (E52329 and N54010) resulted in reducing the phosphorylation of JNK and MKK4, which are known to be involved during inflammatory response. Collectively, we first demonstrated the transcriptomic landscape of lncRNAs in mice brain infected with JEV and analyzed the coexpression network of differentially regulated lncRNAs and mRNAs during JEV infection. Our results provide a better understanding of the host response to JEV infection and suggest that the identified lncRNAs may be used as potential therapeutic targets for the management of Japanese encephalitis.","publish_time":"2017-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yunchuan; Zhang, Hao; Zhu, Bibo; Ashraf, Usama; Chen, Zheng; Xu, Qiuping; Zhou, Dengyuan; Zheng, Bohan; Song, Yunfeng; Chen, Huanchun; Ye, Jing; Cao, Shengbo","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b48e310b1f5d0205ad5ffa292d950d2808185c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5626832.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JNK","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified lncRNAs","regulated lncRNAs","JEV infection","selected lncRNAs","JEV-induced neuroinflammation","JEV-induced inflammation","JEV-infected mice brain","transcriptomic landscape of lncRNAs","host response","mRNAs","management of Japanese encephalitis","Japanese encephalitis virus","inflammatory responses","profound effects","profound neuronal cells damage","host immune","regulated transcripts","lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network","leading cause of epidemic encephalitis","various biological processes","activation of glial cells","important regulatory RNAs","potential therapeutic targets","non-coding RNAs","better understanding","N54010","pathways","functional annotation analysis","E52329","phosphorylation of JNK","MKK4","results","microarray approach","silencing"],"language":"en"},

The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide. With a death toll approaching that of China\u2019s SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert. Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms. RESULTS: This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission. The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.

The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-\u03BAB and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools. Our current approach provides a new strategy in predicting formulation rationale when developing new dietary supplements.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Liang; Hu, Chun; Hood, Molly; Zhang, Xue; Zhang, Lu; Kan, Juntao; Du, Jun","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344708/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12041193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCG Plus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of VCG","innate immune response","dietary approach","current approach","pathways relevant","excessive inflammatory responses","combat CoV infections","CoV infections studies","beneficial approach","inflammation responses","current findings","System biology tools","new dietary supplements","gene ontology","new strategy","modulating targets","Novel coronaviruses","recent advances","hub targets","recent years","Gene target acquisition","recurrent spreading of CoVs","novel combination of vitamin C","Kyoto encyclopedia of genes","curcumin","predicting formulation rationale","phytonutrients research","genomes","ongoing threat","AKT","KEGG","NF-\u03BAB","glycyrrhizic acid","PI3K","global health","pathway enrichment","balance T-cells","interferons production","MAPK","NOD","worth investigation","onset of cytokine storm","economy","specific therapy","world","biological processes","Toll","network analysis","experiments","results"],"language":"en"},

However, whether this effect of MAT is through protecting the integrity and function of the BBB is not known. In the present study, we show that MAT treatment had a therapeutic effect comparable to dexamethasone (DEX) in EAE rats, with reduced Evans Blue extravasation, increased expression of collagen IV, the major component of the basement membrane, and the structure of tight junction (TJ) adaptor protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, MAT treatment attenuated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2 (MMP-9/-2), while it increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 (TIMP-1/-2). Our findings demonstrate that MAT reduces BBB leakage by strengthening basement membrane, inhibiting activities of MMP-2 and -9, and upregulating their inhibitors. Taken together, our results identify a novel mechanism underlying the effect of MAT, a natural compound that could be a novel therapy for MS.","publish_time":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Su; Kan, Quan-Cheng; Xu, Yuming; Zhang, Guang-Xian; Zhu, Lin","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3892a126c127795e96e4e071cf14fd7fdc2e4231.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3781841.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/736085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Evans","TJ"],"organizations":["EAE","CNS","BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of MAT","MAT treatment attenuated expression of matrix metalloproteinase","EAE rats","basement membrane","clinical EAE","BBB leakage","expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase","increased expression of collagen IV","therapeutic effect comparable","novel mechanism","novel therapy","activities of MMP","experimental model of multiple sclerosis","primary characteristic of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","reduced Evans Blue extravasation","TJ","dexamethasone","structure of tight junction","major component","adaptor protein Zonula","quinolizidine alkaloid","natural compound","blood-brain barrier","herb Radix Sophorae Flave","MS","Dysfunction","CNS inflammation","integrity","findings","present study","results","Matrine","TIMP"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify known pathogens at the species or genus level in blinded testing. Despite a lower sensitivity than PCR, EOPM is sufficiently sensitive to detect the predominant pathogens causing clinical symptoms. During application in two recent clinical infectious disease outbreaks in China, EOPM successfully identified the responsible pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: EOPM is an effective surveillance platform for infectious diseases, and can play an important role in infectious disease control.","publish_time":"2013-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Weiwei; Yang, Yinhui; Zhang, Xinlei; Zhao, Changan; Yin, Aihua; Zhang, Xiaozhuang; He, Zhengxin; Jiang, Yongqiang; Zhang, Liang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73761176155e77d6873806dd9579f59e5419111a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3848773.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EOPM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["known pathogens","EOPM data","predominant pathogens","responsible pathogens","control of infectious diseases","infectious disease control","effective identification of pathogens","rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens","recent clinical infectious disease outbreaks","microbial genus","related species","China","effective surveillance platform","large number of microbial genome sequences","cost-effective pathogen screening method","easy operating pathogen microarray","generation sequencing","genus level","genomic sequences","clinical symptoms","high-throughput high-density microarray platform","conventional Sanger sequencing","user-friendly web-based interface","broad coverage","development","prevention","important role","statistical enrichment algorithm","METHODS","PCR","blinded testing","application","availability","lower sensitivity","CONCLUSIONS","multiple probes","RESULTS","mobile population","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Results Among these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5\u201348 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation. The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure. Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died. The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs. 8.8%) (P \u003C 0.0001). Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P \u003C 0.001). By multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of acute renal impairment in SARS. Conclusion Acute renal impairment is uncommon in SARS but carries a high mortality. The acute renal impairment is likely to be related to multi-organ failure rather than the kidney tropism of the virus. The development of acute renal impairment is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with SARS.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Kwok Hong; Tsang, Wai Kay; Tang, Colin S.; Lam, Man Fai; Lai, Fernand M.; To, Ka Fai; Fung, Ka Shun; Tang, Hon Lok; Yan, Wing Wa; Chan, Hilda W.H.; Lai, Thomas S.T.; Tong, Kwok Lung; Lai, Kar Neng","journal":"Kidney International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28dae782723faa61dc10d0050d9f4c01a7f43deb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112337.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253815505061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815505061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["development of acute renal impairment","Conclusion Acute renal impairment","renal factors","Renal tissues","renal insult","SARS patients","acute tubular necrosis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","SARS-CoV","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","clinical presentation","clinical parameters","respiratory complications","plasma creatinine concentration","normal plasma creatinine level","new viral infection","onset of viral infection","emerged infection","days","Kidney tissues","mortality rate","high mortality","adjusted relative risk of mortality","novel coronavirus","significant independent risk factors","retrospective analysis","multivariate analysis","light microscopy","electron microscopy","kidney tropism","multi-organ failure","context of multiorgan failure","age","important negative prognostic indicator","laboratory features","median duration","major outbreak","regional hospitals","survival","postmortem examinations","evidence of glomerular pathology","range","fever","Hong Kong","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade \u2162A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Jian; Liu, Jun; Zhao, Xinguo; Liu, Chengyuan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Dawei; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Chunyu; Yu, Jiong; Jiang, Bin; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/548541513fec823d4600ec793be7541b17133a36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109279/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa199","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Jiangsu"],"keyphrases":["discharged patients","infected patients","proportion of patients","severe patients","laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID","abnormal CT imaging","moderate symptoms","time nucleic acid test","liver dysfunction","Imaging examination","hospitals of Jiangsu","Jiangsu Province","Wuhan","clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease","negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results","main clinical manifestations","abnormal density shadow","respiratory samples","new coronavirus","Real time RT-PCR","obvious gender susceptivity","parenchyma","Grade","female","fever","rest","median age","interim guidance","history of chronic diseases","average length","cough","years","lungs","days","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Although the provision of infection services throughout Europe is not uniform, with variation in the roles of infectious disease physicians and microbiologists, there are, nonetheles, physicians with a predominant responsibility for clinical infectious diseases (and tropical medicine) in most countries. However, infectious diseases is formally recognised as a specific discipline by most, but not yet all, European countries. There has been consensus from national representatives to the UEMS on the content of the published curriculum. There are clear areas of overlap in training between different infection disciplines, and exploration of possible areas for closer liaison and collaboration between them has been initiated. The increased movement of medical staff within Europe will place greater demands on those responsible for training, monitoring and quality assurance. The Board and Section of Infectious Diseases have established core training programmes with a generic logbook to assist those countries without a written curriculum or record book and facilitate the development of common standards of training. The duration of training varies across Europe; 4 years is the UEMS standard, or longer if the training is combined with general internal medicine. The numbers of infection specialists (infectious diseases and microbiology) per million population show considerable variation. The UEMS Sections have recognised the importance of working closely with European specialist societies involved with training. The Section for Infectious Diseases has, in partnership with the ESCMID, established a Board for the accreditation of continuing medical education/continuing professional development.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKendrick, M.

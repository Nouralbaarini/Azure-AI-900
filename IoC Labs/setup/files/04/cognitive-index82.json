We previously reported the establishment of spontaneous JEV persistent infection, assisted by defective interfering particle accumulation and/or attenuated helper viruses, in BHK-21 cells devoid of virus-induced apoptosis, cBS6-2 and cBS6-3. However, cell-specific factors may play important roles in controlling JEV replication and have never been assessed for this specific phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that viruses have evolved various mechanisms to cope with endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways for their efficient amplification and transmission, including the unfolded protein response (UPR). RESULTS: To identify the host cell factors that affect JEV persistence, we investigated the expression of essential UPR factors in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. Of the selected UPR factors tested, the most noticeable deviations from those of the normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection were as follows: the suppression of C/EBP homologous binding protein (CHOP) and the constant up-regulation of immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. In JEV acute infection on normal BHK-21 cells, silencing CHOP expression through specific siRNA blocked cell death almost completely. Meanwhile, depletion of BiP by specific siRNA unlocked CHOP expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells, resulting in massive cell death. Fulminant apoptotic cell death for both cell clones on tunicamycin treatment revealed that the JEV persistently infected cells still contained functional arms for cell fate decisions. CONCLUSIONS: BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection strive against virus-induced apoptosis through constant up-regulation of BiP expression, resulting in the complete depletion of CHOP even with apparent virus amplification in the cells. Accordingly, the attenuation of virus replication as well as the modifications to cell metabolism could be additional factors contributing to the development of JEV persistent infection in mammalian cells.

In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324\u2013720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of \u03B2-mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517\u2013720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation. Our results suggest that the antigenic determinants formed by two domains are likely associated with the probable polymorphic region of the BCV S1 subunit.","publish_time":"1991-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoo, Dongwan; Parker, Michael D.; Song, Jaeyoung; Cov, Graham J.; Deregt, Dirk; Babiuk, Lorne A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a56ce5fa4ee093c053550da1a5c51a4a9e6192db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190121Q; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190121Q","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Antigenic","BCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domains","antigenic determinants","antigenic structure","S1 protein","BCV S1 subunit","antigenic sites","mutant S1 polypeptides","truncated S1 derivatives","mutants","residues","mutant proteins","native conformation","conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes","epitope formation","probable polymorphic region","domain inhibited extracellular secretion","modified genes","S spike glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus","series of cDNA clones","insect cells","Western blot analysis","absence of \u03B2","recombinant baculoviruses","vital function","Deletion","amino acids","intracellular transport","immunoprecipitation","immunoreactive","Monoclonal antibodies","observation","mercaptoethanol","addition","results","order"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: State-of-the-art tools based on in-silico methods are a cost-effective initial approach for identifying appropriate ligands against SARS-CoV-2. The present study developed the 3D structure of the envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular docking analysis was done against various ligands. RESULTS: The highest log octanol/water partition coefficient, high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity were considered for the best ligand for the envelope (mycophenolic acid: log P = 3.00; DG = \u201310.2567 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.713 \u00B5M) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid: log P = 2.901; DG = \u201312.2112 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.885 \u00B5M) of SARS-CoV-2.

Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses. RESULTS: Exposure to esfenvalerate affected swimming behavior of larval delta smelt at concentrations as low as 0.0625 \u03BCg.L(-1), and significant differences in expression were measured in genes involved in neuromuscular activity. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by esfenvalerate exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that microarray technology is a useful approach in screening for, and generation of molecular biomarkers in endangered, non-model organisms, identifying specific genes that can be directly linked with sublethal toxicological endpoints; such as changes in expression levels of neuromuscular genes resulting in measurable swimming impairments. The developed microarrays were successfully applied on larval fish exposed to esfenvalerate, a known contaminant of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary, and has permitted the identification of specific biomarkers which could provide insight into the factors contributing to delta smelt population decline.","publish_time":"2009-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Connon, Richard E; Geist, Juergen; Pfeiff, Janice; Loguinov, Alexander V; D\u0027Abronzo, Leandro S; Wintz, Henri; Vulpe, Christopher D; Werner, Inge","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8b801f23efa409e89226176fec4c0517e330717.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2806348.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA Federal","USA","ASPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of genes","larval delta smelt","specific genes","Selected genes","expression levels of neuromuscular genes","larval fish","swimming behavior of larval delta","esfenvalerate exposure","generation of molecular biomarkers","expression of aspartoacylase","effects of contaminants","pelagic fish species","pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate","identification of specific biomarkers","Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary","RESULTS","population decline","Californian State Endangered Species Acts","genome-wide effects","relevant pyrethroid concentrations","measurable swimming impairments","USA Federal","behavioral responses","immune responses","microarray technology","causative stressors","multiple stressors","measured downregulation","neuromuscular activity","Anthropogenic contaminants","potential causes of population","non-model organisms","Hypomesus transpacificus","strong links","detoxification","brain cell function","osmotic stress","enzyme","apoptosis","indicator of ecosystem health","screening","known contaminant","useful approach","growth","numerous human diseases","study","quantitative PCR analyses","factors","insight","habitat range","insecticides","BACKGROUND","major concern","developed microarrays","significant differences","sublethal toxicological endpoints","development","CONCLUSIONS","\u03BCg","Alterations","Interrogative tools"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood\u2010monocytes and cells from mesenteric lymph nodes were obtained from pigs and cultured with live Bb12 for 4 and 12 h. Transcript levels of IL\u201010 and TLR2 were analysed. Furthermore, TLR2 was blocked to determine its participation in IL\u201010 production. TLR2 blockade was achieved with neutralizing antibodies, followed by stimulation with Bb12. Bifidobacteria induced IL\u201010 production in both swine monocytes and mesenteric cells. Monocytes with TLR2 blockade had a decrease in IL\u201010 transcripts, while mesenteric cells did not.

Pangolins (order Pholidota) are highly threatened mammals, in large part due to the trade in illegal wildlife. During July to August 2018 four sick wild pangolins (three Manis javanica and one Manis pentadactyla) exhibiting a variety of clinical symptoms were rescued by the Jinhua Wildlife Protection Station in Zhejiang province, China. Although three of these animals died, fortunately one recovered after 2 weeks of symptomatic treatment. Using meta-transcriptomics combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified two novel RNA viruses in two of the dead pangolins. Genomic analysis revealed that these viruses were most closely related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses, although still highly genetically distinct, with more than 48 and 25 per cent sequence divergence at the amino acid level, respectively. We named these Dongyang pangolin virus (DYPV) and Lishui pangolin virus (LSPV) based on the sampling site and hosts. Although coltiviruses (LSPV) are known to be transmitted by ticks, we found no evidence of LSPV in ticks sampled close to where the pangolins were collected. In addition, although DYPV was present in nymph ticks (Amblyomma javanense) collected from a diseased pangolin, they were not found in the local tick population. Epidemiological investigation revealed that both novel viruses might have been imported following the illegal international trade of pangolins. Hence, these data indicate that illegal wildlife trafficking not only threatens the status of pangolin populations, but may also spread epizootic pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Wen-Hua; Lin, Xian-Dan; Chen, Yan-Mei; Xie, Chun-Gang; Tan, Zhi-Zhou; Zhou, Jia-Jun; Chen, Shuai; Holmes, Edward C; Zhang, Yong-Zhen","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296543/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DYPV","LSPV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["dead pangolins","illegal international trade of pangolins","illegal wildlife trafficking","wildlife species","novel viruses","diseased pangolin","Lishui pangolin virus","Dongyang pangolin virus","sick wild pangolins","DYPV","nymph ticks","status of pangolin populations","evidence of LSPV","novel RNA viruses","Epizootic pathogens","coltiviruses","Jinhua Wildlife Protection Station","Manis javanica","Manis pentadactyla","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Zhejiang province","RT-PCR","Amblyomma javanense","major threat","cent sequence divergence","amino acid level","meta-transcriptomics","threatened mammals","China","variety of clinical symptoms","context","order Pholidota","sampling site","Epidemiological investigation","data","weeks of symptomatic treatment","local tick population","changing environments","hosts","addition","Genomic analysis","pestiviruses","animals"],"language":"en"},

POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5 h to 19.0 h, p \u003C 0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p \u003C 0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36 h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray\u00AE testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

CoVs encode a proofreading 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.","publish_time":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graepel, Kevin W.; Lu, Xiaotao; Case, James Brett; Sexton, Nicole R.; Smith, Everett Clinton; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e27b2ec189028052ab97b7b959087ac012222a98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5676041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29114026/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01503-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-ExoN","nsp14-ExoN","ExoN activity","ExoN functions","nsp14 of MHV","WT-MHV","increased replication fidelity","CoV high-fidelity replication","P250","Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues","enhanced replication","wild-type MHV","defective replication","CoV fitness","increased susceptibility","multiple nucleoside analogues","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA genome","SARS-CoV","increased competitive fitness","positive-sense RNA viruses","P3","reversion","results","CoVs","fold-decreased fidelity","reduced susceptibility","viable mutant viruses","multiple replicase proteins","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","murine hepatitis virus","novel amino acid changes","nonstructural protein","times","phenotype","selection","cultured cells","exoribonuclease","hypothesis","genotype","significant barrier","active site","proofreading","stability"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: DNA typing for HLA-A and -B loci was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method on 114 randomly selected healthy individuals of the Yi population. The allelic frequencies of HLA-A and -B loci were calculated by direct counting and HLA-A-B haplotypes were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 17 HLA-A and 38 HLA-B alleles were found in the Yi population. The most frequent alleles were A*2402 (32.46%), A*1101 (26.32%), and A*0203 (10.09%) at the HLA-A locus and B*4601 (12.28%), B*1525 (10.09%), B*4001 (8.77%), and B*3802 (7.89%) at the HLA-B locus. The predominant HLA-A-B haplotypes were A*2402-B*1525 (7.86%) and A*0203-B*3802 (5.64%), followed by A*1101-B*4001 (4.69%). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Yi population in the Honghe, Yunnan Province of China basically belongs to groups of southeastern Asian origin, but shares some characteristics with northeastern Asian groups.

The epidemiological features (existence of epidemics, community outbreaks and seasonality), unique age distribution and clinical symptoms and signs of KD suggest that the disease is caused by one or more infectious environmental triggers. However, KD is not transmitted person\u2010to\u2010person and does not occur in clusters within households, schools or nurseries. KD is a self\u2010limited illness that is not associated with the production of autoantibodies or the deposition of immune complexes, and it rarely recurs. Regarding the underlying pathophysiology of KD, innate immune activity (the inflammasome) is believed to play a role in the development of KD vasculitis, based on the results of studies with animal models and the clinical and laboratory findings of KD patients. Animal studies have demonstrated that innate immune pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) can cause vasculitis independently of acquired immunity and have provided valuable insights regarding the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. To validate this concept, we recently searched for KD\u2010specific PAMPs and identified such molecules with high specificity and sensitivity. These molecules have structures similar to those of microbe\u2010associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), as shown by liquid chromatography\u2010tandem mass spectrometry. We propose herein that KD is an innate immune disorder resulting from the exposure of a genetically predisposed individual to microbe\u2010derived innate immune stimulants and that it is not a typical infectious disease.","publish_time":"2016-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hara, T.; Nakashima, Y.; Sakai, Y.; Nishio, H.; Motomura, Y.; Yamasaki, S.","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c900c0fa6eecd1ffe8e54b72d6e0fc0257aefe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5054572.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/cei.12832; https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.12832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27342882/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["signs of KD","development of KD vasculitis","underlying pathophysiology of KD","innate immune pathogen","innate immune disorder","immune activity","laboratory findings of KD patients","derived innate immune stimulants","deposition of immune complexes","microbe","molecular patterns","Animal studies","molecules","Kawasaki disease","typical infectious disease","clinical symptoms","animal models","results of studies","acute systemic vasculitis of childhood","underlying mechanisms","specific PAMPs","transmitted person","known cause","infectious environmental triggers","unique age distribution","community outbreaks","seasonality","existence of epidemics","predisposed individual","exposure","liquid chromatography","tandem mass spectrometry","clusters","valuable insights","MAMPs","epidemiological features","high specificity","households","schools","nurseries","sensitivity","production of autoantibodies","immunity","structures similar","role","aetiology","phenomenon","inflammasome","self\u2010limited illness","concept"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Environmental and health data were collected for the 16 years around the refinery closure. Toronto (2.5 million persons) and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA, 6.3 million persons) were used as control and reference populations, respectively, for Oakville (160,000 persons). We compared sulfur dioxide and age- and season-standardized hospitalizations, considering potential factors such as changes in demographics, socio-economics, drug prescriptions, and environmental variables. Results: The closure of the refinery eliminated 6000 tons/year of SO(2) emissions, with an observed reduction of 20% in wind direction-adjusted ambient concentrations in Oakville. After accounting for trends, a decrease in cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations was observed for Oakville (reduction of 2.2 cases/1000 persons per year, [Formula: see text]) but not in Toronto (p = 0.856) and the GTA (p = 0.334). The reduction of respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville post closure appeared to have no observed link to known confounders or effect modifiers. Conclusion: The refinery closure allowed an assessment of the change in community health. This natural experiment provides evidence that a reduction in emissions was associated with improvements in population health. This study design addresses the impact of a removed source of air pollution.","publish_time":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burr, Wesley S.; Dales, Robert; Liu, Ling; Stieb, Dave; Smith-Doiron, Marc; Jovic, Branka; Kauri, Lisa Marie; Shin, Hwashin Hyun","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cf02f23f08f2b7c8b0e83dcc85d080f9c1cf615.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6163796.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15092029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30227660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["refinery closure","persons","observed reduction","Oakville post closure","reduction of respiratory hospitalizations","residents\u2019 health","health data","community health","population health","oil refinery-related air pollution","season-standardized hospitalizations","emissions","observed link","natural experiment","GTA","Greater Toronto Area","removed source of air pollution","environmental variables","cold-season peak","effects","drug prescriptions","demographics","impact","decrease","age","wind direction","assessment","socio-economics","potential factors","confounders","ambient concentrations","change","improvements","evidence","cases","effect modifiers","trends","sulfur dioxide","control","reference populations","text","Methods","Formula","years","tons","Background","Canada","study design","accounting","opportunity","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The constitutive tetA promoter and the in vivo activated nirB and pagC promoters were evaluated for their use to express two epitopes of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike protein carried by fimbriae which were displayed on a Salmonella vaccine strain. Constructs with the pagC promoter were shown to drive increased expression of chimeric 987P fimbriae in macrophages as well as in Mg2\u002B-poor media, mimicking a major environmental signal found in Salmonella-containing endocytic vacuoles of macrophages. Mice immunized orally with a Salmonella vaccine strain which expressed chimeric fimbriae from the pagC promoter elicited significantly higher mucosal and systemic immune responses to both the 987P fimbriae and the TGEV epitopes than mice immunized with the same strain hosting a tetA or nirB promoter-driven expression plasmid. Moreover, only the Salmonella vaccine strains harboring a plasmid with the pagC promoter, with or without an additional tetA promoter in tandem, elicited neutralizing antibodies to TGEV.

Most studies of bacterial or viral cause in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries. We investigated bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed medical records of 736 cases of AECOPD at the Korea University Guro Hospital. We analyzed bacterial and viral identification rates and classified infections according to epidemiological factors, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage, mortality, and seasonal variation. RESULTS: The numbers of AECOPD events involving only bacterial identification, only viral identification, bacterial-viral co-identification, and no identification were 200 (27.2%), 159 (21.6%), 107 (14.5%), and 270 (36.7%), respectively. The most common infectious bacteria identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (5.3%); the most common viruses identified were influenza virus (12.4%), rhinovirus (9.4%), parainfluenza virus (5.2%), and metapneumovirus (4.9%). The bacterial identification rate tended to be higher at more advanced stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.020 overall, p=0.011 for P. aeruginosa, p=0.048 for S. pneumoniae). Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were identified more in mortality group (p=0.003 for S. aureus, p=0.009 for K. pneumoniae). All viruses were seasonal (i.e., greater prevalence in a particular season; p\u003C0.050). Influenza virus and rhinovirus were mainly identified in the winter, parainfluenza virus in the summer, and metapneumovirus in the spring. CONCLUSION: This information on the epidemiology of respiratory infections in AECOPD will improve the management of AECOPD using antibiotics and other treatments in Korea.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Juwhan; Oh, Jee Youn; Lee, Young Seok; Hur, Gyu Young; Lee, Sung Yong; Shim, Jae Jeong; Kang, Kyung Ho; Min, Kyung Hoon","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5a7b8b5e36fb9c710990a5adbe057fdc1682ec5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6342712.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2019.60.2.216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus","Klebsiella"],"organizations":["Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["bacterial-viral co-identification","viral identification rates","bacterial identification rate","cases of AECOPD","management of AECOPD","viral cause","studies of bacterial","numbers of AECOPD events","parainfluenza virus","common viruses","Klebsiella pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","common cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage","advanced stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","rhinovirus","metapneumovirus","epidemiology of respiratory infections","common infectious bacteria","classified infections","mortality group","Korea University Guro Hospital","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","seasonal variation","Staphylococcus aureus","Global Initiative","epidemiological factors","greater prevalence","summer","information","particular season","winter","antibiotics","medical records","RESULTS","treatments","METHODS","CONCLUSION","spring","Western countries","PURPOSE","Haemophilus influenzae","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

Because of different treatment options for the parasites, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary. The PCR based assays are suitable for differential diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of Small Animal Diarrhoea panel, a multiplexed-tandem real-time PCR (MT-PCR) assay, that detects DNA of both G. intestinalis and T. foetus. The sensitivity and specificity were compared to reference real-time PCR assays using 105 faecal samples, 39.05% (n = 41) positive for G. intestinalis and 30.48% (n = 32) were positive for T. foetus. The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of Ct-values \u003E 35. On the other hand, only one G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier. For G. intestinalis DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 95.1% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. For T. foetus DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 41.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. To evaluate the interlaboratory reproducibility of the MT-PCR assay, results were compared in two different laboratories and found to be in a very good agreement (Kappa = 0.9).

This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. Material and methods Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. Results A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31\u20132.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. Conclusion According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea7be11af0a342fc1fc60431e52239c5f3ba8467.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128942.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298982/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300576?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS CoV"],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["death count data","death counts","linear regression analysis","linear regression model predicted week","Multiple regression","average week","linear regression analyses","auto-regression technique","projected death rate","related outcomes","input variables","Novel Coronavirus","Indian data","risk of over-estimation","risk-based models","present state","spite","world","epidemic","illness","valid treatment","SARS CoV","strong correlation","preventative strategy","date","situation","socioeconomic recession","tracing","trend","chosen inputs","predictive ability","database","havoc","millions","and467","mind","China","Abstract Introduction","test of statistical significance","Material","methods","COVID","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In total, 71% of the selected calves were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. The statistical analysis revealed influence of colostrum quality on faecal score. Linear regression showed that the colostrum quantity during the first day of life was negatively associated with the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faeces.

Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, international public health agencies and learned societies, ECDC-supported laboratory networks have also progressed harmonization of routinely used antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, thereby significantly advancing the quality, comparability and precision of microbiological information gathered by ECDC for surveillance for zoonotic diseases and multidrug-resistant pathogens in Europe. ECDC continues to act as a catalyst for sustaining continuous practice improvements and strengthening wider access to laboratory capacity across the European Union. Key priorities include optimization and broader use of rapid diagnostics, further integration of whole-genome sequencing in surveillance and electronic linkage of laboratory and public health systems. This article highlights some of the network contributions to public health in Europe and the role that ECDC plays managing these networks.","publish_time":"2018-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albiger, Barbara; Revez, Joana; Leitmeyer, Katrin Claire; Struelens, Marc J.","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/994021cbe306f8833d4124d53771d0038d248860.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5834927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29535998/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","ECDC"],"locations":["Europe","European Union"],"keyphrases":["European laboratory networks","laboratory capacity","harmonization of laboratory diagnostic","electronic linkage of laboratory","training of laboratory staff","core of European infectious disease surveillance networks","ECDC plays","public health systems","continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing","European Centre","European Union","international public health agencies","molecular typing methods","antimicrobial susceptibility","Disease Prevention","control","era of global health threats","epidemics of infectious diseases","multidrug-resistant pathogens","multidrug resistance","risk assessment","zoonotic diseases","rapid detection of emerging pathogens","microbiology laboratories","technical capacity mapping","broader use of rapid diagnostics","multicentre method validation","essential scientific evidence","societies","food safety authorities","adaptive capabilities","wider access","optimization","role","continuous practice improvements","precision of microbiological information","epidemic preparedness","integration","genome sequencing","years","network contributions","decades","Key priorities","partnership","comparability","catalyst","Cooperation","article","Activities"],"language":"en"},

Male C57BL/10 mice were used as donors. Male PTX3 knockout (KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates on 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J background were used as recipients. In KO recipients, 7/13 grafted lungs were consolidated without volume recovery on CT scan, while only 2/9 WT mice showed similar graft consolidation. For grafts where lung volume could be reliably analyzed by CT scan, the lung volume recovery was significantly reduced in KO mice compared to WT. Interstitial inflammation, parenchymal fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans scores were significantly higher in KO mice. Presence of myofibroblasts and lymphoid aggregation was significantly enhanced in the grafts of PTX3 KO recipients. Recipient PTX3 deficiency enhanced chronic rejection-like lesions by promoting a fibrotic process in the airways and lung parenchyma.

Bats, like all mammals, rely on a number of innate immune mechanisms to combat invading pathogens, including the interferon type I, II and III responses. Ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a key modulator of these interferon responses. Within these pathways, ISG15 can serve to stabilize host proteins modulating innate immune responses and act as a cytokine. Post-translational modifications of viral proteins introduced by ISG15 have also been observed to directly affect the function of numerous viral proteins. Unlike ubiquitin, which is virtually identical across all animals, comparison of ISG15s across species reveals that they are relatively divergent, with sequence identity dropping to as low as \u223C58% among mammals. In addition to serving as an obstacle to the zoonotic transmission of influenza, these ISG15 species\u2013species differences have also long been shown to have an impact on the function of viral deISGylases. Recently, the structure of the first nonhuman ISG15, originating from mouse, suggested that the structures of human ISG15 may not be reflective of other species. Here, the structure of ISG15 from the bat species Myotis davidii solved to 1.37 \u00C5 resolution is reported. Comparison of this ISG15 structure with those from human and mouse not only underscores the structural impact of ISG15 species\u2013species differences, but also highlights a conserved hydrophobic motif formed between the two domains of ISG15. Using the papain-like deISGylase from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a probe, the biochemical importance of this motif in ISG15\u2013protein engagements was illuminated.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langley, Caroline; Goodwin, Octavia; Dzimianski, John V.; Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Pegan, Scott D.","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa489397dd2392deab6f930c097984a50f653801.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1107/s2059798318015322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30644842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structure of ISG15","ISG15 structure","domains of ISG15","nonhuman ISG15","structural impact of ISG15 species","structures of human ISG15","species differences","interferon responses","bat species Myotis davidii","function of numerous viral proteins","innate immune responses","host proteins","interferon type","mouse","function of viral deISGylases","Ubiquitin","mammals","Bats","Post-translational modifications of viral proteins","origin of numerous human diseases","number of innate immune mechanisms","interferon-stimulated gene product","comparison of ISG15s","conserved hydrophobic motif","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","probe","invading pathogens","zoonotic transmission of influenza","biochemical importance","obstacle","animals","key modulator","\u00C5 resolution","sequence identity","papain","hosts","cytokine","protein engagements","addition","pathways"],"language":"en"},

One hundred sixty-two isolates were collected from different countries, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. A unique species of G. abietina RNA virus\u2013MS1 (GaRV-MS1) appears to occur indistinctly in G. abietina biotypes A and B, without a particular geographical distribution pattern. Forty-six isolates were shown to host GaRV-MS1 according to direct specific RT-PCR screening, and the virus was more common in biotype A than B. Phylogenetic analysis based on 46 partial coat protein (CP) cDNA sequences divided the GaRV-MS1 population into two closely related clades, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences revealed only one clade. The evolution of the virus appears to mainly occur through purifying selection but also through recombination. Recombination events were detected within alignments of the three complete CP and RdRp sequences of GaRV-MS1. This is the first time that recombination events have been directly identified in fungal partitiviruses and in G. abietina in particular. The results suggest that the population dynamics of GaRV-MS1 do not have a direct impact on the genetic structure of its host, G. abietina, though they might have had an innocuous ancestral relationship.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Botella, Leticia; Tuomivirta, Tero T.; Hantula, Jarkko; Diez, Julio J.; Jankovsky, Libor","journal":"Fungal Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f8b4625ea6e410ce24d30ace80fb37a71c03817.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102696.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878614614001767; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878614614001767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25749364/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.12.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["B.

HPV16 infection was shown to decrease in the presence of the lysosomotrophic neutralizing agent ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl). NH(4)Cl neutralizes acidic endo-lysosome compartments, thus suggesting that pH was responsible for PV capsid conformational changes leading endosome escape. RESULTS: However, our data suggested that NH(4)Cl blocked infection by preventing the movement of PV viral particles from the early endosome to the caveosome as was shown for JC virus [1,2]. We have confirmed that HPV 16 infection requires the trafficking of reporter-virions to the caveosome as is the case for BPV1 [3,4]. In this manuscript we propose that the observed decrease in infection of PV in the presence of NH(4)Cl was due to a loss of movement of reporter-virions to caveosomes. We also demonstrate that cysteine proteases are involved in the infectious process, and that cathepsin B treatment of viral particles was shown to overcome the block of infection observed in the presence of furin inhibition. We confirmed the need for cathepsin B in HPV16 infection using cathepsin B null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: We present data that suggest HPV16 infection is in part mediated by cysteine proteases, and that NH(4)Cl blocks the intracellular trafficking of infectious viral particles. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that cysteine proteases influence the infection of a non-enveloped virus.","publish_time":"2009-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dabydeen, Sarah A; Meneses, Patricio I","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/541e4b9cc19cdef991c78ff39e6ad79c1f5ecb09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2718874.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619315/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV16 infection","infection of PV","block of infection","blocked infection","presence of NH","cysteine proteases","movement of PV viral particles","cathepsin B treatment of viral particles","intracellular trafficking of infectious viral particles","infectious pathway","infectious process","early endosome","non-enveloped virus","trafficking of reporter","reporter-virions","observed decrease","cathepsin B null mouse embryonic fibroblasts","presence of furin inhibition","PV capsid conformational changes leading endosome escape","loss of movement","present data","JC virus","non-enveloped Human Papillomavirus Type","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","cell surface","binding","lysosomotrophic","agent ammonium chloride","penetration","demonstration","acidic endo-lysosome compartments","need","caveosomes","case","BPV1","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","manuscript","knowledge","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Fifty HCWs performed a personal or causal glove removal method (pretest) and a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-recommended glove removal method (posttest) at distances of 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin after the application of fluorescent solution (the simulated contaminant) onto their gloved hands.

The Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated in a pilot study of respiratory virus infections. METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection visiting the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital during the winter influenza season of 2014 to 2015 were evaluated. CLART PneumoVir kit, (GENOMICA, Madrid, Spain) was used for viral detection of all known respiratory viruses. Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated with the MILLIPLEX MAP Human TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Correlation of the TH17 profile with viral detection was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Seventy\u2010six patients were evaluated (median age 56 years, 51.3% female); a respiratory virus was identified in 60 (78.9%) patients; 45% had confirmed influenza. Influenza A (H3N2) correlated with higher levels of granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (GM\u2010CSF), interleukin 1\u03B2 (IL\u20101\u03B2), IL\u201017A, IL\u201017E, IL\u201017F, IL\u201021, IL\u201022, and IL\u201023 (P \u003C 0.05 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]) compared with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Parainfluenza virus (PIV) similarly had higher levels of GM\u2010CSF, IL\u20101b, IL\u201017A, IL\u201022 compared with those detected in RSV, influenza B and any other virus infection ( P \u003C 0.05; ANOVA). Increasing age (\u03B2\u2010coefficient = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.04\u20101.2, P \u003C 0.01) as well as IL\u201017A levels (\u03B2\u2010coefficient = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.001\u20101.05, P = 0.04) predicted hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Main Th17 cell effector cytokines were upregulated in laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H3N2) influenza and PIV. Excessive amounts of Th17 cytokines may be implicated in the pathogenesis and immune control of acute influenza and PIV infection in humans and may predict the severity of disease.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antalis, Emmanouil; Spathis, Aris; Kottaridi, Christine; Kossyvakis, Athanasios; Pastellas, Kalliopi; Tsakalos, Konstantinos; Mentis, Andreas; Kroupis, Christos; Tsiodras, Sotirios","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b5954d845694ddd2695243d5732946aec56fbc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166444.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30715745/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MILLIPLEX MAP Human TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore Corp.","PIV"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["TH17 profile","influenza B","clearing influenza infection","Th17 cytokine profile","respiratory syncytial virus","PIV infection","Excessive amounts of Th17 cytokines","winter influenza season","Parainfluenza virus","symptoms of respiratory tract infection","Main Th17 cell effector cytokines","pilot study of respiratory virus infections","immune control of acute influenza","higher levels of GM","known respiratory viruses","viral detection","higher levels of granulocyte","CSF","Consecutive patients","ANOVA","coefficient","H3N2","RSV","MILLIPLEX MAP Human TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel","hospital admission","median age","multivariate analysis","analysis of variance","tertiary care hospital","Millipore","emergency department","macrophage colony","GENOMICA","factor","CONCLUSION","pathogenesis","humans","experimental models","Madrid","Billerica","Spain","laboratory","modulation of inflammation","female","interleukin","CLART PneumoVir kit","years","METHODS","Correlation","BACKGROUND","severity of disease","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about pathogenesis of these diseases. In order to investigate the role of respiratory viruses in chronic adenotonsillar diseases, we developed a cross-sectional study to determine the rates of viral detections of common respiratory viruses detected by TaqMan real time PCR (qPCR) in nasopharyngeal secretions, tonsillar tissues and peripheral blood from 121 children with chronic tonsillar diseases, without symptoms of acute respiratory infections. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 97.5% of patients. The viral co-infection rate was 69.5%. The most frequently detected viruses were human adenovirus in 47.1%, human enterovirus in 40.5%, human rhinovirus in 38%, human bocavirus in 29.8%, human metapneumovirus in 17.4% and human respiratory syncytial virus in 15.7%. Results of qPCR varied widely between sample sites: human adenovirus, human bocavirus and human enterovirus were predominantly detected in tissues, while human rhinovirus was more frequently detected in secretions. Rates of virus detection were remarkably high in tonsil tissues: over 85% in adenoids and close to 70% in palatine tonsils. In addition, overall virus detection rates were higher in more hypertrophic than in smaller adenoids (p = 0.05), and in the particular case of human enteroviruses, they were detected more frequently (p = 0.05) in larger palatine tonsils than in smaller ones. While persistence/latency of DNA viruses in tonsillar tissues has been documented, such is not the case of RNA viruses. Respiratory viruses are highly prevalent in adenoids and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillar diseases, and persistence of these viruses in tonsils may stimulate chronic inflammation and play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","publish_time":"2012-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proenca-Modena, Jose Luiz; Pereira Valera, Fabiana Cardoso; Jacob, Marcos Gerhardinger; Buzatto, Guilherme Pietrucci; Saturno, Tamara Honorato; Lopes, Lucia; Souza, Jamila Mendon\u00E7a; Paula, Flavia Escremim; Silva, Maria Lucia; Carenzi, Lucas Rodrigues; Tamashiro, Edwin; Arruda, Eurico; Anselmo-Lima, Wilma Terezinha","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e16bcce21552d6bb63b2407557f0a8dbd8b007e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3411673.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22870291/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0042136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human adenovirus","human bocavirus","human rhinovirus","detected viruses","human metapneumovirus","human respiratory syncytial virus","Chronic tonsillar diseases","role of respiratory viruses","tonsillar tissues","chronic adenotonsillar diseases","particular case of human enteroviruses","rates of viral detections of common respiratory viruses","case of RNA viruses","chronic inflammation","latency of DNA viruses","Rates of virus detection","palatine tonsils of patients","larger palatine tonsils","overall virus detection rates","tonsil tissues","smaller adenoids","symptoms of acute respiratory infections","persistence","pathogenesis","nasopharyngeal secretions","Results of qPCR","smaller ones","viral co-infection rate","TaqMan real time PCR","peripheral blood","important health problem","sample sites","children","large numbers of surgical procedures","cross-sectional study","addition","order"],"language":"en"},

PRF is also utilized in the expression of a small number of cellular genes. Frameshifting is typically stimulated by signals contained within the mRNA: a \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence and a 3\u2032-adjacent RNA structure. Recently, we showed that \u22121 PRF in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is trans-activated by the viral 2A protein, leading to a temporal change in PRF efficiency from 0% to 70% during virus infection. Here we analyzed PRF in the related Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). We show that 2A is also required for PRF in TMEV and can stimulate PRF to levels as high as 58% in rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translations and 81% during virus infection. We also show that TMEV 2A trans-activates PRF on the EMCV signal but not vice versa. We present an extensive mutational analysis of the frameshift stimulators (mRNA signals and 2A protein) analysing activity in in vitro translation, electrophoretic mobility shift and in vitro ribosome pausing assays. We also investigate the PRF mRNA signal with RNA structure probing.

However, sampling viable airborne viruses is challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in the ultrafine size range (\u003C 100nm). Herein, a Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling of virus aerosols. The BASIC utilizes adiabatic expansion in a supersaturated container to activate condensation of water vapor onto virus aerosol particles, thus amplifying the size of the particles by orders of magnitude. Using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, the BASIC\u0027s performance was evaluated and optimized both from the perspectives of physical size amplification as well as preservation of the viability of the MS2 bacteriophage. Experimental results show that one compression/expansion (C/E) cycle under a compression pressure of 103.5kPa and water temperature of 25\u00B0C was sufficient to increase the particle diameter from \u003C 100nm to \u003E 1\u00B5m; further increases in the number of C/E cycles neither increased particle number concentration nor diameter. An increase in compression pressure was associated with physical size amplification and a higher concentration of collected viable MS2. Water temperature of 40\u00B0C was found to be the optimal for size amplification as well as viability preservation. No significant effect on particle size enlargement was observed by changing the dwell time after expansion. The results illustrate the BASIC\u0027s capability as a simple, quick and inexpensive tool for rapid sampling of viable airborne viruses.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Haoran; Afshar-Mohajer, Nima; Theodore, Alexandros D.; Lednicky, John A.; Fan, Z.

Furthermore distinctive synovial proteome expression patterns segregate patient subgroups. Protein expression patterns localized in the chronically inflamed joint therefore have the potential to identify patients more likely to suffer disease which will spread from a single joint to multiple joints.

CyHV-3 has been implicated in a large number of disease outbreaks in carp populations causing up to 100% mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the requirement of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in CyHV-3 entry and replication in carp cells. Plasma membrane cholesterol was depleted from common carp brain (CCB) cells with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD). Treated and non-treated cells were infected with CyHV-3 and virus binding and infection parameters were assessed using RT-qPCR, immunocytochemistry and virus titration. The effect of cholesterol reduction severely stunted virus entry in vitro, however after cholesterol replenishment virus entry and subsequent replication rates were similar to the control infection. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion did not significantly influence virus binding and the subsequent post-entry replication stage, however had an impact on virus egress. Comparative analysis of the lipid compositions of CyHV-3 and CCB membrane fractions revealed strong similarities between the lipid composition of the CyHV-3 and CCB lipid rafts. The results presented here show that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are important for the CyHV-3 replication cycle especially during entry and egress.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brogden, Graham; Adamek, Miko\u0142aj; Proepsting, Marcus J.; Ulrich, Reiner; Naim, Hassan Y.; Steinhagen, Dieter","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5adf7aca5308543613d1f966616c2fbec18ec21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059657/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.05.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515002205; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515002205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cholesterol replenishment virus entry","virus binding","virus egress","stunted virus entry","lipid compositions of CyHV","virus titration","cholesterol-rich lipid rafts","CCB lipid rafts","requirement of cholesterol","cholesterol depletion","Plasma membrane cholesterol","carp cells","effect of cholesterol reduction","subsequent post-entry replication stage","replication cycle","new Alloherpesviridae virus family","subsequent replication rates","CCB membrane fractions","carp populations","non-treated cells","common carp brain","infection parameters","control infection","strong similarities","methyl-\u03B2","RT-qPCR","member","large number of disease outbreaks","Herpesvirales order","cyclodextrin","immunocytochemistry","impact","Comparative analysis","M\u03B2CD","study","Cyprinus herpesvirus","aim","mortality","results"],"language":"en"},

It has many potential causes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Mice lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1) develop age-dependent spongiform encephalopathy. We identified an interaction between a \u201CPSAP\u201D motif in MGRN1 and the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of TSG101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I), and demonstrate that MGRN1 multimonoubiquitinates TSG101. We examined the in vivo consequences of loss of MGRN1 on TSG101 expression and function in the mouse brain. The pattern of TSG101 ubiquitination differed in the brains of wild-type mice and Mgrn1 null mutant mice: at 1 month of age, null mutant mice had less ubiquitinated TSG101, while in adults, mutant mice had more ubiquitinated, insoluble TSG101 than wild-type mice. There was an associated increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels in mutant brains. These results suggest that loss of MGRN1 promotes ubiquitination of TSG101 by other E3s and may prevent its disassociation from endosomal membranes or cause it to form insoluble aggregates. Our data implicate loss of normal TSG101 function in endo-lysosomal trafficking in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration in Mgrn1 null mutant mice.","publish_time":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Jian; Sun, Kaihua; Walker, Will P.; Bagher, Pooneh; Cota, Christina D.; Gunn, Teresa M.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9868e3bb0651eb9ef03ee35e382a4eb17d9e33a5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e78ca38be8e94ab6738aec212d803f68e4e0a07e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2755232.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.08.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443909001902; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443909001902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19703557/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2755232?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mgrn1 null mutant mice","MGRN1 multimonoubiquitinates TSG101","ubiquitinated TSG101","insoluble TSG101","ubiquitination of TSG101","loss of MGRN1","domain of TSG101","TSG101 expression","wild-type mice","pattern of TSG101 ubiquitination","loss of normal TSG101 function","mutant brains","pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration","brains of wild","consequences of loss","age-dependent spongiform encephalopathy","month of age","endosomal membranes","insoluble aggregates","ubiquitin E2 variant","endosomal sorting complex","E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger","epidermal growth factor receptor","EGFR","endo-lysosomal trafficking","levels","associated increase","motif","component","UEV","adults","appearance of vacuoles","transport","data","underlying cellular mechanisms","central nervous system","potential causes","mouse brain","disassociation","PSAP","E3s","ESCRT","interaction","results"],"language":"en"},

Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration \u003C0.2 \u03BCM. Conclusion: This study provides a proof of concept for the novel strategy to identify anti-HBV agents by targeting the candidate HBV receptor, NTCP, using CsA as a structural platform.

It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.

The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries. METHODS A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020. The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied. RESULTS A total of 226 patients were included. Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57-70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male. The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days. Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2-8). Organ function damages were found in most of the patients: ARDS in 161 (71.2%) patients, septic shock in 34 (15.0%) patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 57 (25.2%) patients, cardiac injury in 61 (27.0%) patients, and lymphocytopenia in 160 (70.8%) patients. Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of severe complications and need to receive an intensive level of treatments.

The ability of bats to remain asymptomatic to viral infection may be due to the rapid control of viral replication very early in the immune response through innate antiviral mechanisms. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) represent the first line of defence against viral infection in mammals, with both families of IFNs present in pteropid bats. To obtain further insight into the type III IFN system in bats, we describe the characterization of the type III IFN receptor (IFN\u03BBR) in the black flying fox, P. alecto with the characterization of IFN\u03BBR1 and IL10R2 genes that make up the type III IFN receptor complex. The bat IFN\u03BBR complex has a wide tissue distribution and at the cellular level, both epithelial and immune cells are responsive to IFN-\u03BB treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bat IFN\u03BBR1 chain acts as a functional receptor. To our knowledge, this report represents the first description of an IFN receptor in any species of bat.

How do IFNLs impact COPD and its exacerbations? METHODS: Five hundred twenty eight patients were recruited in a prospective observational multicentre cohort (PROMISE) study. The genetic polymorphisms (rs8099917 and rs12979860) within the IFNL3/4 gene region and circulating levels of IFNL3 in COPD patients were determined and associated with disease activity and outcome during a median follow-up of 24 months. RESULTS: The GG genotype significantly influenced severe exacerbation rate (42 vs. 23%; p = 0.032) and time to severe exacerbation (HR = 2.260; p = 0.012). Compared to the TT or TG genotypes, the GG genotype was associated with severe dyspnoea (modified medical research council score \u2265 median 3; 22 vs 42%, p = 0.030). The CC genotype of the rs12979860 SNP was associated with a poorer prognosis (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea and exercise capacity index \u2265 median 4; 46 vs. 36% TC vs. 20.5% TT; p = 0.031).

Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of \u03B2-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03B4 and \u03B2 mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03B1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03B3, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of \u03B2-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of \u03B2-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis. Above findings supported desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent for potential prevention of disorders involving lipid metabolism.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xin-Luan; Wang, Nan; Zheng, Li-Zhen; Xie, Xin-Hui; Yao, Dong; Liu, Ming-Yan; Yao, Zhi-Hong; Dai, Yi; Zhang, Ge; Yao, Xin-Sheng; Qin, Ling","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b9319ed0c8b5dffcee0c320e46d2d54724e2b8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094326.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23792141/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299913004743; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299913004743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of desmethylicaritin","adipogenesis","protein expression of \u03B2","\u03B2 mRNA expression","\u03B2-catenin","protein expression of adipgenic","mRNA expression of CCAAT","mRNA expression of Wnt10b","adipocyte lipid-binding protein","enhancer binding protein \u03B1","enhancer binding protein \u03B4","nuclear translocation of \u03B2","nuclear location of \u03B2","lipid metabolism","mRNA level","extravascular lipid deposition","clonal expansion","findings","potential prevention of disorders","3T3-L1 cells","3T3-L1 preadipocytes","Abstract Epimedium flavonoids","prevention of steroid","bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids","immunofluorescence results","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03B3","novel phytochemical agent","Oil Red O staining","related factors","cytoplasm","nuclei","qRT-PCR","lipoprotein lipase","dose-dependent manner","serum","pathway","associated osteonecrosis","western blot","addition","underlying mechanism","process of suppression","immunofluoresence assay","aidpogenesis","phytoestrogen","adipogenic induction","study","Bromodeoxyuridine"],"language":"en"},

Due to frequent coinfections with other respiratory viruses, PCR of plasma samples and detection of specific IgM might aid in determining the etiology of infection.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ur\u0161i\u010D, Tina; Petrovec, Miroslav","journal":"Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c89089ee91f82b8b65bde98c840a6629822bfe3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173585.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124169753000157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124169753000157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","respiratory viruses","hospitalized children","detection of HBoV1 DNA","severe clinical course of HBoV1 infection","years of age","months of age","routine laboratory diagnostics of HBoV1 infections","PCR of plasma samples","genus Bocavirus","Human bocavirus","etiology of infection","detection of specific IgM","family Parvoviridae","subfamily Parvovirinae","adults","frequent coinfections","underlying medical conditions","worldwide distribution","IgG antibodies","life","seroepidemiological studies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the post\u2010mortem histopathological findings and investigated localisation of viral particles in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissue by transmission electron microscopic examination in a 33\u2010year\u2010old male patient of T cell lymphoma, who acquired MERS\u2010CoV infection. Tissue needle biopsies were obtained from brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. All samples were collected within 45 min from death to reduce tissue decomposition and artefact. Histopathological examination showed necrotising pneumonia, pulmonary diffuse alveolar damage, acute kidney injury, portal and lobular hepatitis and myositis with muscle atrophic changes. The brain and heart were histologically unremarkable. Ultrastructurally, viral particles were localised in the pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles.

It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from healthy donors, and measured MERS-CoV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and neutralizing antibody titers, as well as T cell responses. Totals of 16/30 CWs and 0/30 healthy control donors were seropositive by MERS-CoV-specific ELISA and/or neutralizing antibody titer, and an additional four CWs were seronegative but contained virus-specific T cells in their blood. Although virus transmission from CWs has not been formally demonstrated, a possible explanation for repeated MERS outbreaks is that CWs develop mild disease and then transmit the virus to uninfected individuals. Infection of some of these individuals, such as those with comorbidities, results in severe disease and in the episodic appearance of patients with MERS.","publish_time":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alshukairi, Abeer N.; Zheng, Jian; Zhao, Jingxian; Nehdi, Atef; Baharoon, Salim A.; Layqah, Laila; Bokhari, Ahmad; Al Johani, Sameera M.; Samman, Nosaibah; Boudjelal, Mohamad; Ten Eyck, Patrick; Al-Mozaini, Maha A.; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley; Alagaili, Abdulaziz N.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1703fbc6de47798061e7ec8d87182906fedab8e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6212820.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01985-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CWs","measured MERS-CoV","majority of MERS cases","camel herders","repeated MERS outbreaks","continued emergence of MERS","well-documented camel exposure","cohort of camel workers","specific ELISA","severe disease","emerging disease","mild disease","virus transmission","lethal respiratory disease","virus-specific T cells","healthy donors","majority of patients","healthy control donors","neutralizing antibody titers","specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","immunofluorescence assay","epidemic spread","blood samples","uninfected individuals","Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","episodic appearance of patients","T cell responses","route of transmission unclear","Middle East respiratory syndrome","handlers","CEPI","truck drivers","IFA","hospital","novel coronavirus","high potential","important target","camels","KSA","Coalition","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","sensitive immunological assays","possible explanation","comorbidities","community acquisition","vaccine development","results","indirect source","controls","Totals","Infection"],"language":"en"},

Despite lifelong physiological therapy and antibiotics, the lungs of affected patients are progressively destroyed, leading to respiratory insufficiency. Recessive mutations in Dynein Axonemal Intermediate chain type 1 (DNAI1) gene have been described in 10% of cases of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Our goal was to restore normal ciliary beating in DNAI1\u2013deficient human airway epithelial cells. A lentiviral vector based on Simian Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein was used to transduce cultured human airway epithelial cells with a cDNA of DNAI1 driven by the Elongation Factor 1 promoter. Transcription and translation of the transduced gene were tested by RT\u2013PCR and western blot, respectively. Human airway epithelial cells that were DNAI1\u2013deficient due to compound heterozygous mutations, and consequently had immotile cilia and no outer dynein arm, were transduced by the lentivirus. Cilia beating was recorded and electron microscopy of the cilia was performed. Transcription and translation of the transduced DNAI1 gene were detected in human cells treated with the lentivirus. In addition, immotile cilia recovered a normal beat and outer dynein arms reappeared. We demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a normalization of ciliary beat frequency of deficient human airway epithelial cells by using a lentivirus to transduce cells with the therapeutic gene. This preliminary step constitutes a conceptual proof that is indispensable in the perspective of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia\u0027s in vivo gene therapy.

Techniques for estimating R 0 , either from incidence data or in-host clinical measures, often rely on estimates of mean transition times, that is, the mean time before recovery, death or quarantine occurs. In many cases, however, either data or intuition may provide additional information about the dispersal of these transition times about the mean, even if the precise form of the underlying probability distribution remains unknown. For example, we may know that recovery typically occurs within a few days of the mean recovery time. In this paper we elucidate common situations in which R 0 is sensitive to the dispersal of transition times about their respective means. We then provide simple correction factors that may be applied to improve estimates of R 0 when not only the mean but also the standard deviation of transition times out of the infectious state can be estimated.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heffernan, J.

During influenza vaccine production, by either conventional or cell culture methods, there is a risk of incidental contamination by adventitious agents. Thus, a risk-assessment model has been developed to qualitatively assess the potential risk of vaccine process contamination by viral pathogens. The model takes into account the basic growth characteristics of each virus, its ability to grow in different cell substrates and resistance to processing steps during vaccine manufacture. The risk-assessment model has been applied to various pathogens to determine potential risk and relevance in different manufacturing scenarios, using different cell substrates for virus propagation, including Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Avian viruses, introduced via use of embryonated eggs for virus isolation, were found to present the greatest risk, irrespective of the substrate used for influenza virus propagation. The use of MDCK cells to propagate vaccine virus from egg-isolated influenza virus strains does not introduce a new or greater adventitious virus risk, compared with egg-based vaccine production. Indeed, the adventitious virus risk is potentially reduced as fewer viruses are able to grow in MDCK cells.","publish_time":"2008-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gregersen, Jens-Peter","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91388764b01e051b00401e4efb12caca8b979484.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115387.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08004143; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08004143; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.03.076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18468737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine virus","virus isolation","influenza virus propagation","greater adventitious virus risk","greatest risk","risk-assessment model","potential risk of vaccine process contamination","risk of incidental contamination","vaccine manufacture","Abstract Influenza vaccine production","egg-isolated influenza virus strains","different cell substrates","cell-culture","egg-based vaccine production","use of MDCK cells","cell culture methods","use of embryonated eggs","different manufacturing scenarios","use of embryonated chicken eggs","adventitious agents","derived manufacturing methods","viral pathogens","various pathogens","fewer viruses","Avian viruses","Madin","Darby canine kidney","resistance","relevance","basic growth characteristics","steps","ability","account"],"language":"en"},

There is little information regarding the host factors that correlate with and contribute to MHV-induced demyelination. Here, we detail the genes and pathways associated with MHV-induced demyelinating disease in the spinal cord. High-throughput sequencing of the host transcriptome revealed that demyelination is accompanied by numerous transcriptional changes indicative of immune infiltration as well as changes in the cytokine milieu and lipid metabolism. We found evidence that a Th1-biased cytokine/chemokine response and eicosanoid-derived inflammation accompany persistent MHV infection and that antigen presentation is ongoing. Interestingly, increased expression of genes involved in lipid transport, processing, and catabolism, including some with known roles in neurodegenerative diseases, coincided with demyelination. Lastly, expression of several genes involved in osteoclast or bone-resident macrophage function, most notably TREM2 and DAP12, was upregulated in persistently infected mouse spinal cord. This study highlights the complexity of the host antiviral response, which accompany MHV-induced demyelination, and further supports previous findings that MHV-induced demyelination is immune-mediated. Interestingly, these data suggest a parallel between bone reabsorption by osteoclasts and myelin debris clearance by microglia in the bone and the CNS, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using an RNA-seq approach to study the host CNS response to persistent viral infection.","publish_time":"2013-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elliott, Ruth; Li, Fan; Dragomir, Isabelle; Chua, Ming Ming W.; Gregory, Brian D.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45dd7b43349a7cd110254e46282dd4968dcdffbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3776850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058676/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075346","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-induced demyelination","persistent MHV infection","host CNS response","Persistent infection","host antiviral response","host transcriptome","host factors","persistent viral infection","chemokine response","bone reabsorption","demyelinating disease","infected mouse spinal cord","increased expression of genes","study","mouse central nervous system","mouse hepatitis virus","bone-resident macrophage function","lipid transport","cytokine milieu","lipid metabolism","model system","numerous transcriptional changes indicative of immune infiltration","Th1-biased cytokine","eicosanoid-derived inflammation","osteoclasts","myelin debris clearance","microglia","previous findings","catabolism","antigen presentation","RNA-seq approach","known roles","TREM2","multiple sclerosis","neurodegenerative diseases","processing","complexity","High-throughput sequencing","report","DAP12","evidence","data","little information","pathways","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Pig diarrhea especially post-weaning diarrhea remains one of the most important swine diseases. ETEC bacterial fimbriae including K88, F18, 987P, K99 and F41 promote bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate ETEC colonization in pig small intestine. ETEC enterotoxins including heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins type Ia (porcine-type STa) and type II (STb) stimulate fluid hyper-secretion, leading to watery diarrhea. Blocking bacteria colonization and/or neutralizing enterotoxicity of ETEC toxins are considered effective prevention against ETEC diarrhea. In this study, we applied the MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen) strategy to create toxoid MEFAs that carried antigenic elements of ETEC toxins, and examined for broad antitoxin immunogenicity in a murine model. By embedding STa toxoid STa(P12F) (NTFYCCELCCNFACAGCY), a STb epitope (KKDLCEHY), and an epitope of Stx2e A subunit (QSYVSSLN) into the A1 peptide of a monomeric LT toxoid (LT(R192G)), two toxoid MEFAs, \u2018LT(R192G)-STb-Stx2e-STa(P12F)\u2019 and \u2018LT(R192G)-STb-Stx2e-3xSTa(P12F)\u2019 which carried three copies of STa(P12F), were constructed.

Moreover, suckling piglets born by a gilt immunized with \u2018LT(R192G)-STb-Stx2e-3xSTa(P12F)\u2019 were protected when challenged with ETEC strains, whereas piglets born by a control gilt developed diarrhea. Results from this study showed that the toxoid MEFA induced broadly antitoxin antibodies, and suggested potential application of the toxoid MEFA for developing a broad-spectrum vaccine against ETEC diarrhea in pigs.","publish_time":"2016-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rausch, Dana; Ruan, Xiaosai; Nandre, Rahul; Duan, Qiangde; Hashish, Emad; Casey, Thomas A.; Zhang, Weiping","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/191350faa97b3279eb49a1b4135ed0a6a6d8985b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172483.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.02.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351630027X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351630027X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["ETEC","MEFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ETEC diarrhea","STa toxoid STa","ETEC colonization","ETEC strains","STb-Stx2e","monomeric LT toxoid","ETEC enterotoxins","Stx2e toxins","P12F","toxoid MEFAs","Pig diarrhea","neutralizing enterotoxicity of ETEC toxins","ETEC bacterial fimbriae","antigenic elements of ETEC toxins","R192G","STb epitope","watery diarrhea","copies of STa","epitope of Stx2e","porcine-type STa","main cause of diarrhea","post-weaning diarrhea","antitoxin antibodies","Induced antibodies","heat-stable toxins type Ia","IgG antibodies","pigs","xSTa","study","bacterial attachment","neutralizing activities","bacteria colonization","control gilt","suckling piglets","heat-labile toxin","broad antitoxin immunogenicity","pig small intestine","intestinal epithelial cells","F41","F18","strategy","broad-spectrum vaccine","A1 peptide","effective prevention","K99","QSYVSSLN","K88","multiepitope fusion antigen","fluid hyper-secretion","potential application","NTFYCCELCCNFACAGCY","murine model","subunit","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","KKDLCEHY","important swine diseases","Mice","Results"],"language":"en"},

In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.

Participating veterinarians enrolled 831 dairy herds and submitted fecal samples from 2,565 female dairy cattle for Salmonella culture because of suspicion of clinical disease. Estimates of animal-level incidence rates were calculated for each age group as the number of cases per animal time at risk, and an estimate of herd-level incidence rate was calculated as the number of positive herds per herd time at risk. Descriptive analysis of serotype data and level of antimicrobial resistance was performed, and Poisson regression analysis was used to study associations between the within-herd incidence of salmonellosis and certain predictor variables (herd size, housing type, vaccination status, and prior history of Salmonella infection). Salmonella was isolated from 576 (22.5%) samples representing 93 herds. The animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 8.1, 0.04, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively. The herd-level incidence rate was 8.6 positive herds per 100 herd-years. Salmonella Newport was the predominant serotype, accounting for 41% of the cases, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium. Over 68% of all isolates were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobial agents. Herd size was the only significant predictor of the incidence of salmonellosis in a multivariable model; herds with at least 400 female dairy cattle had a higher incidence rate than smaller herds.

A total of 32 barrows and gilts, approximately 1 wk post-wean (BW = 8.46 \u00B1 0.50 kg), and na\u00EFve for PEDV were obtained, weighed, and allotted based on sex and BW to one of two treatments: 1) Control, PEDV na\u00EFve and 2) PEDV-inoculated (PEDV) with eight pens of two pigs each per treatment. On day post-inoculation (dpi) 0, PEDV pigs were inoculated via intragastric gavage with PEDV isolate (USA/Iowa/18984/2013). Pig and feeder weights were recorded at dpi \u22127, 0, 5, and 20 in order to calculate ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Eight pigs per treatment were euthanized on dpi 5 and 20, and tissues and blood were collected. At dpi 5, all PEDV pigs were PCR positive for PEDV in feces. Overall, PEDV pigs tended (P \u003C 0.10) to increase ADFI, which resulted in reduced (P \u003C 0.05) feed efficiency. At dpi 5, PEDV pigs had reduced (P \u003C 0.05) villus height and increased (P \u003C 0.05) stem cell proliferation in the jejunum compared with Control pigs. Pigs inoculated with PEDV had increased (P \u003C 0.05) serum haptoglobin and increased insulin-to-glucose ratios compared with Control pigs at dpi 5. Markers of muscle proteolysis were not different (P \u003E 0.05) between treatments within dpi; however, at dpi 5, 20S proteasome activity was increased (P \u003C 0.05) in longissimus dorsi of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. Liver and jejunum gluconeogenic enzyme activities were not different (P \u003E 0.05) between treatments within dpi. Overall, PEDV-inoculated pigs did recover the absorptive capacity that was reduced during PEDV infection by increasing proliferation of intestinal stem cells. However, the energy and nutrients needed to recover the epithelium may be originating from available luminal nutrients instead of muscle proteolysis and gluconeogenesis.

This review aims to summarize the respective findings and to discuss possible molecular mechanisms by which zinc could influence viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and the response to vaccination. Zinc supplementation in diseases such as diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, acute lower respiratory infection, and leishmaniasis seems beneficial. In contrast, the results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in most vaccination and rheumatoid arthritis studies. For AIDS and type 1 diabetes, zinc supplementation may even be a risk factor for increased mortality or deterioration of the glucose metabolism, respectively. In these cases, zinc supplementation should be used with care and limited to clearly zinc-deficient individuals.","publish_time":"2008-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Overbeck, Silke; Rink, Lothar; Haase, Hajo","journal":"Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f85d33b30f4c9821c4c9d16f0712c4a2c25204ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18250973/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00005-008-0003-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zinc supplementation","zinc administration","zinc-dependent functions","loss of zinc secondary","autoimmune diseases","immune system","vaccination","outcome of various diseases","rheumatoid arthritis studies","leprosy","pneumonia","tuberculosis","shigellosis","diarrhea","acute lower respiratory infection","deterioration","chronic hepatitis C","sufficient availability","increased mortality","risk factor","leishmaniasis","parasitic infections","possible molecular mechanisms","respective findings","results","malaria","essential trace element","multiple cellular tasks","type","diabetes","glucose metabolism","immunity","response","AIDS","contrast","review","cases","care","deficient individuals","efforts","decades"],"language":"en"},

Since it is often impossible to observe the state of all nodes in a network, a common method is to detect harmful cascades from sparsely placed sensors. However, the harmful cascades are usually dynamic (e.g., the cascade initiators and diffusion trajectories can change over the time), which can severely destroy the robustness of selected sensors. Meanwhile the large scale of current networks greatly increases the time complexity of sensor selection. Motivated by the observation, in this paper we investigate the scalable sensor selection problem for early detection of dynamic harmful cascades in networks. Specifically, we first put forward a dynamic susceptible-infected model to describe harmful cascades, and formally define a detection time minimization (DTM) problem which focuses on effective sensors placement for early detection of dynamic cascades. We prove that it is #P-hard to calculate the objective function exactly and propose two Monte-Carlo methods to estimate it efficiently. We prove the NP-hardness of DTM problem and design a corresponding greedy algorithm. Based on that, we propose an efficient upper bound based greedy (UBG) algorithm with the theoretical performance guarantee reserved. To further meet different types of large-scale networks, we propose two accelerations of UBG: Quickest-Path-UBG for sparse networks and Local-Reduction-UBG for dense networks to improve the time complexity. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world social networks demonstrate the practicality of our approaches.","publish_time":"2017-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Chuan; Lu, Wei-Xue; Zhang, Jingzun; Li, Lei; Hu, Yue; Guo, Li","journal":"J Comput Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2db98aa242e3e84116afdfad5e250943c55ac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102699.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877750317305434; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2017.10.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317305434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sparse networks","dense networks","early detection of dynamic harmful cascades","early detection of dynamic cascades","real-world social networks","detection time minimization","DTM problem","accelerations of UBG","large scale of current networks","different types of large-scale networks","time complexity of sensor selection","scalable sensor selection problem","placed sensors","dynamic susceptible-infected model","corresponding greedy algorithm","effective sensors placement","robustness of selected sensors","Local-Reduction","Quickest-Path","experimental results","common method","diffusion trajectories","cascade initiators","paper","practicality","theoretical performance guarantee","objective function","state","nodes","NP-hardness","Monte-Carlo methods","approaches","destructive influence","causes","observation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Eligible Japanese tourists (1,480) aged \u226515 years traveling in Chiangmai Province in the north, Ayutthaya Province in the center, Kanchanaburi Province in the west, Pattaya City in the east, and Krabi Province in the south of Thailand were enrolled in the study. Of these tourists, 1,318 consented to participate in this study and completed questionnaires in Japanese, giving a response rate of 89.1%. RESULTS: Among these Japanese tourists 21.3% had diarrheal illness, and of these tourists, 5.0% had classical travelers\u2019 diarrhea (TD), 11.8% had mild TD, 3.3% had good food and drink related behaviors, and 75.4% had moderate level of perception of diarrhea related to drinking and eating. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated three significant diarrheal illness predictors: large number of previous visits to Thailand, longer stay in Thailand, and the experience of visiting other countries. Furthermore, 56.9% suggested providing an adequate number of toilets at tourist destinations; 53.9% suggested providing a 24-hour emergency call facility for a public ambulance; and 51.9% suggested providing garbage bins and garbage disposal facilities at tourist destinations. CONCLUSIONS: TD still affects experienced Japanese tourists who visit Thailand. Although the proportions of the good levels of food and drink related behaviors were low, there were indications that Japanese tourists perceived the risk of contracting TD.","publish_time":"2006-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suwannapong, Nawarat; Howteerakul, Nopporn; Boonshuyar, Chaweewon","journal":"Environ Health Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f555eb7cee704756a696f3d628466c7431bb6690.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02905277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21432378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chiangmai","Ayutthaya","Kanchanaburi","Pattaya City","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["experienced Japanese tourists","Eligible Japanese tourists","related behaviors","Ayutthaya Province","Kanchanaburi Province","Krabi Province","Chiangmai Province","good food","mild TD","south of Thailand","significant diarrheal illness predictors","good levels of food","tourist destinations","risk of contracting TD","study","garbage bins","response rate","prevalence rate","garbage disposal facilities","adequate number of toilets","classical travelers\u2019 diarrhea","large number of previous visits","west","center","Multiple logistic regression analysis","east","Pattaya City","north","indications","facility","association","hour emergency","public ambulance","moderate level of perception","health care needs","proportions","questionnaires","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","years","RESULTS","countries"],"language":"en"},

Biofilm infections are typically chronic in nature, as biofilm-residing bacteria can be resilient to both the immune system, antibiotics, and other treatments. This is a comprehensive review describing biofilm diseases in the auditory, the cardiovascular, the digestive, the integumentary, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system. In most cases reviewed, the biofilms were identified through various imaging technics, in addition to other study approaches. The current knowledge on how biofilm may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease indicates a number of different mechanisms. This spans from biofilm being a mere reservoir of pathogenic bacteria, to playing a more active role, e.g., by contributing to inflammation. Observations also indicate that biofilm does not exclusively occur extracellularly, but may also be formed inside living cells. Furthermore, the presence of biofilm may contribute to development of cancer. In conclusion, this review shows that biofilm is part of many, probably most chronic infections. This is important knowledge for development of effective treatment strategies for such infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vestby, Lene K.; Gr\u00F8nseth, Torstein; Simm, Roger; Nesse, Live L.","journal":"Antibiotics (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5c1c652a7f7768b805977e4439939d9a2aa01e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167820.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics9020059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32028684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Biofilm infections","biofilm diseases","bacterial biofilm","presence of biofilm","biofilm-related","chronic infections","pathogenesis of disease","important knowledge","development of cancer","immune system","current knowledge","comprehensive review","urinary system","active role","development of effective treatment strategies","mere reservoir of pathogenic bacteria","addition","nature","various imaging technics","biofilms","digestive","number of different mechanisms","antibiotics","increased focus","Recognition","fact","spans","study approaches","treatments","conclusion","cases","Observations","inflammation","cells"],"language":"en"},

Upon any detection of invading pathogen products (e.g., TLR agonists) or host-released signaling factors (e.g., interferon/IFN), these cells undergo an activation process to release large numbers of inflammatory substances that participate in inflammation and homeostasis. The profound effects of inflammation associated with TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848) and type 1 interferon (e.g., IFN-\u03B1)-induced macrophage and dendritic cell activation on biological outcomes have long been recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined in microglial cells. METHODS: The present study investigated the molecular signatures of microglia and identified genes that are uniquely or synergistically expressed in R848-, IFN-\u03B1- or R848 with IFN-\u03B1-treated primary microglial (PM) cells. We used RNA-sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR, and bioinformatics approaches to derive regulatory networks that control the transcriptional response of PM to R848, IFN-\u03B1 and R848 with IFN-\u03B1. RESULTS: Our approach revealed that the inflammatory response in R848 with IFN-\u03B1-treated PM is faster and more intense than that in R848 or IFN-\u03B1-treated PM in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes and the magnitude of induction/repression. In particular, our integrative analysis enabled us to suggest the regulatory functions of TFs, which allowed the construction of a network model that explains how TLR7/8 and IFN-\u03B1-sensing pathways achieve specificity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the systematic approach presented herein could be important to the understanding microglial activation-mediated molecular signatures induced by inflammatory stimuli related to TLR7/8, IFN-\u03B1 or co-signaling, and associated transcriptional machinery of microglial functions and neuroinflammatory mechanisms.

Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions. High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events. At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs. In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died. On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons. Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the ACE2 gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous. Secondly, the higher ACE2 expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data. Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17). Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death. Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gemmati, Donato; Bramanti, Barbara; Serino, Maria Luisa; Secchiero, Paola; Zauli, Giorgio; Tisato, Veronica","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21103474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","ACE2 rebalancing","ACE2 balance","higher levels of ACE2","epidemiological data","promising data","infection","human ACE2 receptor","ACE2 gene lays","X-heterozygous females","higher ACE2 expression rate","gender-biased data","related genes responsible","female COVID","sex dimorphism","X-chromosome","ACE1","outcome of COVID","women","inflammation","China","pronounced sex-related differences","high number of immune","anti-malaria","new coronavirus","adaptive immune responses","anti-coagulant drugs","long-term fallout of coronavirus","High mortality rates","controversial scientific journals","World Health Organization","subsequent pulmonary shutdown","cell entry","unrestrained cytokines-storm","dedicated treatments","ABO locus","transmembrane serine protease","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome","essential role","main actors","Hong Kong hospitals state","use of anti-inflammatory","strong interaction","approved vaccines","mosaic advantage","SRY","SOX3","TMPRSS2","micro thromboembolism events","central points","patients","contrast","Chinese scientists","present time","intensive care","ADAM17","elderly","worst prognosis","thrombosis","cases","hand","psychosocial reasons","sexes","disease","city of Wuhan","pandemic proportions","death","progression","RAS-pathway","epidemic","addition"],"language":"en"},

The numerical results of the airflow field were firstly compared against the experimental data in the literature to validate the reliability of the simulations. Airborne droplets were assumed to be released by passengers through coughing and their transport characteristics were modelled using the Lagrangian approach. Numerical results found that the particle travel distance was very sensitive to the release locations, and the impact was more significant along the longitudinal and horizontal directions. Particles released by passengers sitting next to the windows could travel much further than the others. A quantifiable approach was then applied to assess the individual infection risks of passengers. The key particle transport information such as the particle residence time yielded from the Lagrangian tracking process was extracted and integrated into the Wells-Riley equation to estimate the risks of infection.

Growth performance data were analyzed as a 2 \u00D7 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with a control within a completely randomized block design to evaluate the main effects of plasma processing (UV irradiated vs. nonirradiated) and dietary inclusion level, and block, room, and pen were random effects. In phase 1, there were no differences in G:F among treatments, but pigs fed 6% UV-SDPP and 6% SDBP had greater (P \u003C 0.01) ADG (0.11 vs. 0.08 kg/d) and ADFI (0.17 vs. 0.15 kg/d) than pigs fed the control, 3% SDBP, and 3% UV-SDPP diets. After phase 1 (d13), feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP increased (P = 0.02) the BW of pigs. In phases 2 and 3 and the overall feeding period (d 0 to 55), there were no differences in ADG, ADFI, and G:F among dietary treatments. There was a linear decrease (P \u003C 0.01) in mortality of nursery pigs as dietary inclusion rate of SDBP and UV-SDPP increased. In conclusion, feeding SDBP or UV-SDPP diets improved ADG and ADFI during the first 2 wk after weaning due to improved feed consumption, and UV irradiation appeared to have no detrimental effects on the feeding value of SDPP.","publish_time":"2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cottingim, K.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that STING also modulates responses to RNA viruses, though the mechanisms remain less clear. In this review, we give a brief overview of the ways in which STING facilitates sensing of RNA viruses. These include modulation of RIG-I-dependent responses through STING\u0027s interaction with MAVS, and more speculative mechanisms involving the DNA sensor cGAS and sensing of membrane remodelling events. We then provide an in-depth literature review to summarise the known mechanisms by which RNA viruses of the families Flaviviridae and Coronaviridae evade sensing through STING. Our own work has shown that the NS2B/3 protease complex of the flavivirus dengue virus binds and cleaves STING, and that an inability to degrade murine STING may contribute to host restriction in this virus. We contrast this to the mechanism employed by the distantly related hepacivirus hepatitis C virus, in which STING is bound and inactivated by the NS4B protein. Finally, we discuss STING antagonism in the coronaviruses SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus NL63, which disrupt K63-linked polyubiquitination and dimerisation of STING (both of which are required for STING-mediated activation of IRF-3) via their papain-like proteases. We draw parallels with less-well characterised mechanisms of STING antagonism in related viruses, and place our current knowledge in the context of species tropism restrictions that potentially affect the emergence of new human pathogens.","publish_time":"2014-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maringer, Kevin; Fernandez-Sesma, Ana","journal":"Cytokine Growth Factor Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9b5959ee499c95df781f5ee16a284f79d67b46b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/95742e15e5dc39ed30e4b72398dd4a49507dcec1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4330990.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610114000872; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2014.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25212897/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610114000872","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["murine STING","dimerisation of STING","characterised mechanisms of STING antagonism","STING-mediated activation of IRF","sensing of RNA viruses","DNA viruses","related viruses","speculative mechanisms","known mechanisms","dependent responses","interferon responses","human coronavirus NL63","flavivirus dengue virus","related hepacivirus hepatitis C virus","activation of type","sensing of membrane remodelling events","coronaviruses SARS coronavirus","DNA sensor cGAS","in-depth literature review","emergence of new human pathogens","MAVS","infection","important signalling adaptor","families Flaviviridae","protease complex","K63-linked polyubiquitination","current knowledge","recent years","context of species tropism restrictions","Coronaviridae","STING\u0027s interaction","ways","host restriction","brief overview","increasing body of evidence","NS2B","bacteria","inability","modulation of RIG","papain","parallels","NS4B protein","proteases","work"],"language":"en"},

Despite the availability of PEDV vaccines in the domestic market, the disease continues to plague the Korean pork industry, raising issues regarding their protective efficacy and new vaccine development. Therefore, PEDV isolation in cell culture is urgently needed to develop efficacious vaccines and diagnostic assays and to conduct further studies on the virus biology. In the present study, one Korean PEDV strain, KOR/KNU-141112/2014, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in Vero cells for over 30 passages. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the Korean PEDV isolate were investigated. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by cytopathology, immunofluorescence, and real-time RT-PCR. The infectious virus titers of the viruses during the first 30 passages ranged from 105.1 to 108.2 TCID50 per ml. The inactivated KNU-141112 virus was found to mediate potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized guinea pigs. Animal studies showed that KNU-141112 virus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, and acute atrophic enteritis, indicating that strain KNU-141112 is highly enteropathogenic in the natural host. In addition, the entire genomes or complete S genes of KNU-141112 viruses at selected cell culture passages were sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness.

Protective sterile immunity (\u003E90%) against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has been achieved using a transgenically modified Plasmodium berghei sporozoite (Tg-Pb/PfCSP) and a self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) vaccine presenting CSP epitopes (PfCSP-SAPN). Here, several possible mechanisms involved in the independently protective humoral and cellular responses induced following SAPN immunization are described. METHODS: Inbred mice were vaccinated with PfCSP-SAPN in PBS. Serum antibodies were harvested and effects on P. falciparum sporozoites mobility and integrity were examined using phase contrast microscopy. The functionality of SAPN-induced antibodies on inhibition of sporozoite invasion and growth within primary human hepatocytes was also examined. The internal processing of SAPN by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDDC), using organelle-specific, fluorescent-tagged antibody or gold-encapsulated SAPN, was observed using confocal or electron microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: The results of this work demonstrate that PfCSP-SAPN induces epitope-specific antibody titers, predominantly of the Th2 isotype IgG1, and that serum antibodies from PfCSP-SAPN-immunized mice appear to target P. falciparum sporozoites via the classical pathway of complement. This results in sporozoite death as indicated by cessation of motility and the circumsporozoite precipitation reaction. Moreover, PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies are able to inhibit wild-type P. falciparum sporozoite invasion and growth within cultured primary human hepatocytes. In addition, the observation that PfCSP-SAPN are processed (and presented) to the immune system by dendritic cells in a slow and continuous fashion via transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) recruitment to the early endosome (EE), and have partially delayed processing through the endoplasmic reticulum, has the potential to induce the long-lived, effector memory CD8(\u002B) T-cells as described previously. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the examination of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms induced by PfCSP-SAPN vaccination which result in sterile host protection against a transgenic P. berghei malaria sporozoite expressing the P. falciparum CSP, and which significantly inhibits native P. falciparum sporozoites from invading and developing within cultured human hepatocytes. These results may indicate the type and mode of action of protective antibodies needed to control P. falciparum sporozoites from infecting humans as well as a potential mechanism of induction of protective long-lived effector memory CD8(\u002B) T-cells.","publish_time":"2013-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCoy, Margaret E; Golden, Hannah E; Doll, Tais APF; Yang, Yongkun; Kaba, Stephen A; Burkhard, Peter; Lanar, David E","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8e9fcc34571f9c29e04f9feb34197250556cb9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607541/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-12-136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tg-Pb/PfCSP","CSP","PBS","SAPN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PfCSP-SAPN vaccination","functionality of SAPN","internal processing of SAPN","protective antibodies","falciparum CSP","falciparum sporozoite invasion","following SAPN immunization","gold-encapsulated SAPN","induced antibodies","protective immune mechanisms","falciparum sporozoites mobility","RESULTS","Serum antibodies","Protective sterile immunity","Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein","berghei malaria sporozoite","cellular immune mechanisms","sporozoite death","long-lived sterile immune responses","human host","cultured human hepatocytes","T-cells","protective long-lived effector memory CD8","cultured primary human hepatocytes","inhibition of sporozoite invasion","immune system","transgenically modified Plasmodium berghei sporozoite","growth","cellular responses","sterile host protection","possible mechanisms","antigen processing","CSP epitopes","delayed processing","bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","examination of humoral","wild-type","epitope-specific antibody titers","immunized mice","organelle-specific","Inbred mice","electron microscopy","potential mechanism of induction","enhanced vaccine efficacy","circumsporozoite precipitation reaction","phase contrast microscopy","self-assembling protein nanoparticle","lack of defined correlates of immunity","Tg-Pb","recruitment","TAP","transporter","continuous fashion","BMDDC","integrity","improved understanding","cessation of motility","need","inability","effects","Th2 isotype IgG1","infecting humans","mode of action","early endosome","endoplasmic reticulum","work","classical pathway of complement","BACKGROUND","paper","observation","CONCLUSION","METHODS","addition","PBS"],"language":"en"},

While the percentage of atypical pathogens identified was lower than expected, we found a significant relationship between atypical bacterial-viral co-infection and severity of disease in this refugee population.","publish_time":"2011-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Curi; Nyoka, Raymond; Ahmed, Jamal A.; Winchell, Jonas M.; Mitchell, Stephanie L.; Kariuki Njenga, M.; Auko, Erick; Burton, Wagacha; Breiman, Robert F.; Eidex, Rachel B.","journal":"J Immigr Minor Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b552955a463adfe2f94c4e78747a00b4a0f4bd42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701900/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10903-011-9494-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C. pneumoniae","M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["atypical bacteria co-infected","percentage of atypical pathogens","atypical bacterial-viral co-infection","common causes of atypical pneumonia","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydia pneumoniae","respiratory viruses","Patients positive","Legionella","refugee camps","refugee population","refugee setting","oropharyngeal specimens","severe acute respiratory illness","severity of disease","healthcare centers","significant relationship","data","Kenya"],"language":"en"},

High-throughput sequencing of total extracted nucleic acids from lung, esophagus and spleen revealed a novel nidovirus. PCR indicated the presence of viral RNA in lung, trachea, esophagus, liver, and spleen. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of intracellular, intracytoplasmic viral nucleic acids in the lungs of infected snakes.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient\u0027s general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. CONCLUSION This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hornuss, Daniel; Laubner, Katharina; Monasterio, Carmen; Thimme, Robert; Wagner, Dirk","journal":"Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403153/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1170-6061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR-analysis","CLINICAL FINDINGS","diagnosis of COVID","deep oral swab-samples","deep oral swabs","oral treatment","associated pneumonia","days","SARS-CoV","radiological findings","case of COVID","suspect of COVID","negative PCR results","typical clinical features","pathological findings","sputum","PATIENT HISTORY","cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID","Laboratory examination","result of SARS","left lung FINDINGS","Analysis of deeper airway samples","clinical recovery antiviral therapy","chest","increased values","normal values","bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates","Physical examination","possible secondary bacterial infection","evaluation of syncopes","orthostatic syncopes","bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation","intravenous antibiotic treatment","Detection of viral RNA","beginning","basal soft crackling noises","pro-BNP","bronchoalveolar lavage","LDH","CRP","tracheal secretions","high blood pressure","emergency department","year old construction worker","Pulmonary auscultation","ampicillin","stool","repeated attempts","leucocytes","sulbactam","symptoms","indication","antibiotics","onset","prolonged fever","coughs","known hypertension","Conventional X-Ray","COURSE OF EVENTS","requirements","procalcitonin","examinations","CT-scan","vital signs","sultamicillin","patient\u0027s general practitioner","isolation","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Philipp P.; Rath, Barbara A.; Fragkou, Paraskevi C.; Antalis, Emmanouil; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Skevaki, Chrysanthi","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5c42a60e6acca6dfa7f00eded4016b6c4a4c854.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202255.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel respiratory viruses","new viruses","SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","different viruses","MERS-CoV","human coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","human polyomaviruses","human bocavirus","MERS coronavirus","care tests","rapid diagnostic tests","respiratory tract infections","description of new","severe respiratory illness","need","treatment of RTIs","kind of tests","generation of POCTs","improved lab-based detection methods","available rapid point","published characteristics of POCTs","current lab","nucleic acid amplification methods","RV-C","novel strains of influenza virus","care settings","specific treatment options","rhinovirus type C","innovative diagnostic techniques","biosensors","intensified search","potential future use","HMPV","mild cold","associated symptoms","NL63","HCoV-HKU1","HBoV","availability of pathogen","retrospective studies","majority","work","increasing number","implications","beginning","discovery","clinical presentation","assays","significant limitations","problem","KIPyV","WUPyV","key aspect","reliable diagnosis","review","century","ideas","prototypes","outlook"],"language":"en"},

Here we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomics-based strategies, a pan-viral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n = 17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information. Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments. These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings.","publish_time":"2010-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greninger, Alexander L.; Chen, Eunice C.; Sittler, Taylor; Scheinerman, Alex; Roubinian, Nareg; Yu, Guixia; Kim, Edward; Pillai, Dylan R.; Guyard, Cyril; Mazzulli, Tony; Isa, Pavel; Arias, Carlos F.; Hackett, John; Schochetman, Gerald; Miller, Steve; Tang, Patrick; Chiu, Charles Y.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccfba2653a0baee4d4a733902529dc5c96bc69d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2956640.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico","Canada","United States"],"keyphrases":["pandemic H1N1 influenza","H1N1 genome","H1N1 infection","influenza genome","Deep sequencing yielded reads","novel virus","percentage of sequence reads","sequence data","limits of detection","reference sequence","Virochip","swine influenza viruses","streamlined metagenomics detection strategy","novel pathogen","virus titer","metagenomics-based strategies","pathogen discovery","outbreak samples","practical front-line diagnostic","percentage of aligned sequences","multiple conventional diagnostic tests","near full-length genomic segments","outbreaks","host gene expression","upper respiratory microbiota","comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses","blueprint","response","assembly","pan-viral microarray","earliest stages","Mexico","unknown infectious diseases","insights","titers","identification","characterization","specific RT-PCR","public health settings","Canada","cost","complexity","novo","United States","nasopharyngeal swabs","unbiased analysis","utility","information","results","coverage"],"language":"en"},

Methods A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of New South Wales. Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. Results On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. Conclusion Increasing medical students\u0027 awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance.

Disease-control advanced and new epidemiologic evidence identified risk factors for the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases such as the cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and others. Medical care also improved and became more accessible through health insurance systems both in the private and governmental sector. Health systems became more combined public\u2013private endeavors, with health insurance for medical- and hospital-care taking center stage. Epidemiology blossomed as a science following World War II, producing vital insights and evidence of contributory factors to noncommunicable diseases. In the 1960s the cumulative evidence of smoking as a direct cause of lung cancer and heart disease was identified as a major public health challenge. These relationships became clear and increasingly accepted after the US Surgeon General\u2019s Report in 1964. In 1974, Hon. Marc Lalonde, Canada\u2019s Minister of National Health and Welfare issued the book A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, which identified genetic, environmental, personal lifestyle, and medical care as equally important issues in personal and population health. New Perspectives led to the \u201COttawa Charter\u201D in 1986 which defined health promotion and has become a vital issue in public health. The health promotion movement immediately found a crucial role in smoking reduction and diet change to deal with the pandemics of lung cancer and heart disease. In the 1980s health promotion found itself at the frontline dealing with the HIV pandemic when there were no biomedical means to stem the pandemic of death from AIDS. Public health had to find new and effective instruments for disease control. A renewed emphasis on social inequalities in health in the 21st century exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) addressed vulnerable populations with linked targets of reducing poverty, promoting education and gender equality, safer environment, and biomedical disease-control measures as global health policy. This more holistic approach to population health has become a leading element in modern public health largely based on the intellectual contribution of Marc Lalonde.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.","journal":"Case Studies in Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db6ed8cb9a0815328994b1034aeca618dd497ae8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150308.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128045718000287; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128045718000287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marc Lalonde"],"organizations":["National Health and Welfare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population health","Health systems","Health of Canadians","modern public health","s health promotion","health insurance systems","health promotion movement","global health policy","major public health challenge","Canada\u2019s Minister of National Health","disease control","heart disease","disease prevention","combined public","Disease-control advanced","biomedical disease-control measures","Medical care","new epidemiologic evidence","New Perspectives","evidence of contributory factors","cumulative evidence of smoking","hospital-care","century","pandemics of lung cancer","cardiovascular diseases","direct cause of lung cancer","growing burden of noncommunicable diseases","risk factors","vital insights","private endeavors","biomedical means","personal lifestyle","vital issue","smoking reduction","intellectual contribution of Marc Lalonde","pandemic of death","HIV pandemic","Welfare","increasing capacity","scientific breakthroughs","crucial role","safer environment","MDGs","poverty","vulnerable populations","education","book","important issues","leading element","gender equality","immunology","microbiology","linked targets","Millennium Development Goals","diet","World War","social inequalities","effective instruments","renewed emphasis","frontline","US Surgeon General\u2019s Report","nutrition","center stage","Ottawa Charter","holistic approach","governmental sector","sciences","Epidemiology","AIDS","Abstract","relationships"],"language":"en"},

Identification of inpatients for safe early discharge (ie, reverse triage) could create additional hospital surge capacity. We sought to develop a disposition classification system that categorises inpatients according to suitability for immediate discharge on the basis of risk tolerance for a subsequent consequential medical event. Methods We did a warfare analysis laboratory exercise using evidence-based techniques, combined with a consensus process of 39 expert panellists. These panellists were asked to define the categories of a disposition classification system, assign risk tolerance of a consequential medical event to each category, identify critical interventions, and rank each (using a scale of 1\u201310) according to the likelihood of a resultant consequential medical event if a critical intervention is withdrawn or withheld because of discharge. Findings The panellists unanimously agreed on a five-category disposition classification system. The upper limit of risk tolerance for a consequential medical event in the lowest risk group if discharged early was less than 4%. The next categories had upper limits of risk tolerance of about 12% (IQR 8\u201315%), 33% (25\u201350%), 60% (45\u201380%) and 100% (95\u2013100%), respectively. The expert panellists identified 28 critical interventions with a likelihood of association with a consequential medical event if withdrawn, ranging from 3 to 10 on the 10-point scale. Interpretation The disposition classification system allows conceptual classification of patients for suitable disposition, including those deemed safe for early discharge home during surges in demand. Clinical criteria allowing real-time categorisation of patients are awaited.","publish_time":"2006-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelen, Gabor D; Kraus, Chadd K; McCarthy, Melissa L; Bass, Eric; Hsu, Edbert B; Li, Guohua; Scheulen, James J; Shahan, Judy B; Brill, Justin D; Green, Gary B","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8167b94a7c3592a7ec805a977913bd34abb9e199.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138047.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606698085; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673606698085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subsequent consequential medical event","resultant consequential medical event","medical care","category disposition classification system","basis of risk tolerance","upper limits of risk tolerance","upper limit of risk tolerance","safe early discharge","suitable disposition","expert panellists","high-consequence event","conceptual classification of patients","early discharge home","immediate discharge","critical interventions","lowest risk group","categories","scale","likelihood of association","Identification of inpatients","health-care systems","real-time categorisation of patients","serious concern","warfare analysis laboratory exercise","evidence-based techniques","patient volume","disaster","sudden increases","reverse triage","surges","suitability","consensus process","additional hospital surge capacity","Clinical criteria","demand","Interpretation","Summary Background","Methods","rank","Findings","IQR"],"language":"en"},

Recent evidence suggests that surface TLR2 may also contribute to viral detection through recognition of viral coat proteins but its role in the outcome of acute viral infection remains elusive. In this study, we examined in vivo the role of TLR2 in acute infections induced by the highly hepatotrophic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) type 3 and weakly hepatotrophic MHV\u2010A59 serotype. To address this, C57BL/6 (wild\u2010type; WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) groups of mice were intraperitoneally infected with MHV3 or MHV\u2010A59. MHV3 infection provoked a fulminant hepatitis in WT mice, characterized by early mortality and high alanine and aspartate transaminase levels, histopathological lesions and viral replication whereas infection of TLR2 KO mice was markedly less severe. MHV\u2010A59 provoked a comparable mild and subclinical hepatitis in WT and TLR2 KO mice. MHV3\u2010induced fulminant hepatitis in WT mice correlated with higher hepatic expression of interferon\u2010\u03B2, interleukin\u20106, tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03B1, CXCL1, CCL2, CXCL10 and alarmin (interleukin\u201033) than in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice and in MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice. Intrahepatic recruited neutrophils, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells or macrophages rapidly decreased in MHV3\u2010infected WT mice whereas they were sustained in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice and MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO. MHV3 in vitro infection of macrophagic cells induced rapid and higher viral replication and/or interleukin\u20106 induction in comparison to MHV\u2010A59, and depended on viral activation of TLR2 and p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase. Taken together, these results support a new aggravating inflammatory role for TLR2 in MHV3\u2010induced acute fulminant hepatitis.","publish_time":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bleau, Christian; Burnette, M\u00E9lanie; Filliol, Aveline; Piquet\u2010Pellorce, Claire; Samson, Michel; Lamontagne, Lucie","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a852bbf6eeb7e844121d763f492c0eb82f547fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5011685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273587/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12627; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected WT mice","infected TLR2 KO mice","infection of TLR2 KO mice","role of TLR2","MHV3 infection","viral activation of TLR2","TLR2 knockout","surface TLR2","groups of mice","viral detection","higher viral replication","outcome of acute viral infection","acute fulminant hepatitis","A59 serotype","weakly hepatotrophic MHV","subclinical hepatitis","interleukin","infection of macrophagic cells","recognition of viral coat proteins","natural killer cells","hepatotrophic mouse hepatitis virus","natural killer T cells","acute infections","new aggravating inflammatory role","antiviral inflammatory responses","higher hepatic expression of interferon","aspartate transaminase levels","histopathological lesions","p38 mitogen","high alanine","cytosolic helicase sensors","early mortality","receptors","TLRs","CCL2","macrophages","tumour necrosis factor","Intrahepatic recruited neutrophils","CXCL10","activated protein kinase","cellular endosomal Toll","alarmin","results","liver","induction","comparison","Recent evidence","C57BL","study"],"language":"en"},

We collected blood for culture, induced sputum for culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and obtained oropharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients, and serum for serology and nasopharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients and controls. Results. Of 984 eligible case patients, 810 (84%) were enrolled in the study; 232 (29%) had VSP. Blood cultures were positive in 52 of 749 case patients (7%). A predominant potential pathogen was identified in sputum culture in 70 of 417 case patients (17%). A respiratory virus was detected by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 486 of 805 case patients (60%) and 172 of 369 controls (47%). Only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) showed a statistically significant association between virus detection in the nasopharynx and pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio, 12.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.1\u201351.5). Among 257 case patients in whom all specimens (excluding serum specimens) were collected, bacteria were identified in 24 (9%), viruses in 137 (53%), mixed viral and bacterial infection in 39 (15%), and no pathogen in 57 (22%); bacterial causes outnumbered viral causes when the results of the case-control analysis were considered. Conclusions. A potential etiology was detected in \u003E75% of children admitted with SP or VSP. Except for RSV, the case-control analysis did not detect an association between viral detection in the nasopharynx and hospitalization for pneumonia.","publish_time":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammitt, Laura L.; Kazungu, Sidi; Morpeth, Susan C.; Gibson, Dustin G.; Mvera, Benedict; Brent, Andrew J.; Mwarumba, Salim; Onyango, Clayton O.; Bett, Anne; Akech, Donald O.; Murdoch, David R.; Nokes, D.

However, their characterization is incomplete because prevalence estimates are based on syndromic surveillance data. Here, we address this shortcoming through the analysis of infection rates among individuals tested regularly for respiratory viral infections, irrespective of their symptoms. METHODS: We carried out longitudinal sampling and analysis among 214 individuals enrolled at multiple New York City locations from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined personal information with weekly nasal swab collection to investigate the prevalence of 18 respiratory viruses among different age groups and to assess risk factors associated with infection susceptibility. RESULTS: 17.5% of samples were positive for respiratory viruses. Some viruses circulated predominantly during winter, whereas others were found year round. Rhinovirus and coronavirus were most frequently detected. Children registered the highest positivity rates, and adults with daily contacts with children experienced significantly more infections than their counterparts without children. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infections are widespread among the general population with the majority of individuals presenting multiple infections per year. The observations identify children as the principal source of respiratory infections. These findings motivate further active surveillance and analysis of differences in pathogenicity among respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galanti, Marta; Birger, Ruthie; Ud\u2010Dean, Minhaz; Filip, Ioan; Morita, Haruka; Comito, Devon; Anthony, Simon; Freyer, Greg A.; Ibrahim, Sadiat; Lane, Benjamin; Ligon, Chanel; Rabadan, Raul; Shittu, Atinuke; Tagne, Eudosie; Shaman, Jeffrey","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/485b039c35ff2b0b0d592af3856fd9de63d47d01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6468062.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770641/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","Respiratory viral infections","multiple infections","Children","principal source of respiratory infections","analysis of infection rates","majority of individuals","analysis of differences","year","prevalence estimates","active surveillance","infection susceptibility","highest positivity rates","syndromic surveillance data","multiple New York City locations","adults","different age groups","weekly nasal swab collection","risk factors","general population","major cause of morbidity","personal information","daily contacts","pathogenicity","longitudinal sampling","samples","CONCLUSION","mortality","characterization","observations","findings","shortcoming","BACKGROUND","METHODS","spring","winter","symptoms","counterparts","Rhinovirus","coronavirus","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Tao; Wu, Qunfu; Zhang, Zhigang","journal":"Curr Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2776c8cd33a11dbe32e524583232475425bfdca2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/51d819872f5d3c9754771653d2d5f7ebdc871082.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fa876adce142f9df2404dde162fc755de721c6c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156161.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220303602; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960982220303602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32197085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liu"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Pangolin-CoV","related CoV","pangolin species","natural reservoir of SARS","S1 protein of Pangolin","pangolin lung samples","potential intermediate hosts of SARS","BatCoV RaTG13","CoVs","spread","amino acid mutations","key amino acid residues","control COVID","novel coronavirus","outbreak of coronavirus disease","putative furin recognition sequence motif","interaction","S2 cleavage site","occurrence","human ACE2","published data","dead Malayan pangolins","evolutionary evidence","city of Wuhan","China","study","genome level","Liu"],"language":"en"},

The isolation of the novel pestivirus from animals affected clinically posed concerns about the validity of BVDV eradication programs, considering that \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus (BVDV-3) is undetected or mistyped by the molecular diagnostic tools currently employed. In this paper, the development of a nested PCR (nPCR) assay for unambiguous typing of all bovine pestiviruses is reported. The assay consisted of a first-round amplification using an oligonucleotide pair which binds to conserved sequences located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region and capsid gene, followed by a heminested PCR using virus-specific forward primers. The assay performances were evaluated analytically, showing good sensitivity and specificity. By analysis of 100 BVDV-positive samples typed using a nPCR assay discriminating ruminant pestiviruses, five samples recognised previously as BVDV-2 were not typed when submitted to the new assay (n = 2) or reacted as \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus BVDV-3 (n = 3).

Interviews were conducted between August 2008 and June 2010. The characteristics of 56 dairy farms with at least one confirmed case of BNP (thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia and/or typical findings in post-mortem examination and bone marrow histology) were compared with those of two sets of 50 control dairy farms each, with no history of BNP. The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced. The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms. Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n =56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n =50) and (2) case farms (n =56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n =50). All variables with p \u003C0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models. In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure\u00AE BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114\u201314707). In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted. In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production. The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure\u00AE BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20\u20139095).","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauter-Louis, Carola; Carlin, Annette; Friedrich, Annette; Assad, Aryan; Reichmann, Frederike; Rademacher, G\u00FCnter; Heuer, Cord; Klee, Wolfgang","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d205480b1b5704003ff43d9dbb8b531827fcfb7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132418.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587712000682; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587712000682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22386740/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.02.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMU Munich","Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia","BNP"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["case farms","BNP case","control dairy farms","selected control farms","matched set of control farms","confirmed case of BNP","case control study","use of PregSure","control of parasites","history of BNP","non-conditional analysis","odds ratio","non-conditional logistic regression models","use of vitamin E","use of prophylactic measures","stepwise logistic regression models","univariable analysis","use of stem growth regulators","frequent use of mastitis tubes","BVD vaccine","veterinary practices","variables","numbers of calves","vaccination of calves","observed increase","clinical signs of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia","post-mortem examination","typical findings","selenium","LMU Munich","possible risk factors","bone marrow histology","farm level","leukocytopenia","thrombocytopenia","grain production","respiratory disease","Ruminants","sets","southern Germany","characteristics","separate analyses","Interviews"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness.

Qualitative and quantitative differences in humoral and cellular immune responses associated with the flu vaccination in 2009/2010 (pandemic H1N1 vaccine) and natural infection have not yet been described in detail. We designed a longitudinal study to examine influenza- (flu-) specific immune responses and the association between pre-existing flu responses, symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), impact of pandemic flu infection, and pandemic flu vaccination in a cohort of 2,040 individuals in Sweden in 2009\u20132010. METHODS: Cellular flu-specific immune responses were assessed by whole-blood antigen stimulation assay, and humoral responses by a single radial hemolysis test. RESULTS: Previous seasonal flu vaccination was associated with significantly lower flu-specific IFN-\u03B3 responses (using a whole-blood assay) at study entry. Pandemic flu vaccination induced long-lived T-cell responses (measured by IFN-\u03B3 production) to influenza A strains, influenza B strains, and the matrix (M1) antigen. In contrast, individuals with pandemic flu infection (PCR positive) exhibited increased flu-specific T-cell responses shortly after onset of ILI symptoms but the immune response decreased after the flu season (spring 2010). We identified non-pandemic-flu vaccinated participants without ILI symptoms who showed an IFN-\u03B3 production profile similar to pandemic-flu infected participants, suggesting exposure without experiencing clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Strong and long-lived flu-M1 specific immune responses, defined by IFN-\u03B3 production, in individuals after vaccination suggest that M1-responses may contribute to protective cellular immune responses. Silent flu infections appeared to be frequent in 2009/2010. The pandemic flu vaccine induced qualitatively and quantitatively different humoral and cellular immune responses as compared to infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic H1N1 influenza strain.","publish_time":"2014-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magalhaes, Isabelle; Eriksson, Mikael; Linde, Charlotte; Muhammad, Rashid; Rane, Lalit; Ambati, Aditya; Axelsson-Robertson, Rebecca; Khalaj, Bahareh; Alvarez-Corrales, Nancy; Lapini, Giulia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Linde, Annika; Pedersen, Nancy L; Maeurer, Markus","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c437ea3972c987ed041833f65535b2d4300e095.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1434efe4d841738948735807bd1d1f1e9a36225e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4067073.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["pandemic flu vaccine responses","pandemic flu vaccination","pre-existing flu responses","Cellular flu-specific immune responses","flu season","impact of pandemic flu infection","humoral responses","M1-responses","long-lived flu-M1 specific immune responses","pandemic-flu infected participants","lower flu-specific IFN-\u03B3 responses","subsequent immune responses","increased flu-specific T-cell responses","Silent flu infections","non-pandemic-flu vaccinated participants","protective cellular immune responses","Previous seasonal flu vaccination","pandemic H1N1 vaccine","symptoms of influenza","H1N1 pandemic H1N1 influenza strain","long-lived T-cell responses","clinical symptoms","natural infection","onset of ILI symptoms","influenza B strains","individuals","IFN-\u03B3 production profile similar","blood assay","blood antigen stimulation assay","Previous exposures","study entry","longitudinal study","PCR positive","association","quantitative differences","matrix","single radial hemolysis test","cohort","RESULTS","illness","contrast","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Sweden","spring"],"language":"en"},

This phenomenon poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems. Aging is one of the most important risk factors for infections and a myriad of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. A common denominator that is implicated in these diseases is the immune system. The immune system consists of the innate and adaptive arms that complement each other to provide the host with a holistic defense system. While the diverse interactions between multiple arms of the immune system are necessary for its function, this complexity is amplified in the aging immune system as each immune cell type is affected differently-resulting in a conundrum that is especially difficult to target. Furthermore, certain cell types, such as \u03B3\u03B4 T cells, do not fit categorically into the arms of innate or adaptive immunity. In this review, we will first introduce the human \u03B3\u03B4 T cell family and its ligands before discussing parallels in mice. By covering the ontogeny and homeostasis of \u03B3\u03B4 T cells during their lifespan, we will better capture their evolution and responses to age-related stressors. Finally, we will identify knowledge gaps within these topics that can advance our understanding of the relationship between \u03B3\u03B4 T cells and aging, as well as age-related diseases such as cancer.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Weili; Lau, Zandrea Wan Xuan; Fulop, Tamas; Larbi, Anis","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397491/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9051181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aging immune system","homeostasis of \u03B3\u03B4 T cells","immune cell type","age-related diseases","human \u03B3\u03B4 T cell family","myriad of diseases","arms of innate","adaptive arms","neurodegenerative diseases","holistic defense system","multiple arms","cancer","certain cell types","age-related stressors","adaptive immunity","ligands","infections","relationship","developed countries","phenomenon","unprecedented challenges","healthcare systems","important risk factors","complexity","understanding","function","ontogeny","diverse interactions","topics","world","coming decades","parallels","evolution","responses","host","lifespan","greying","knowledge gaps","mice","common denominator","conundrum","populations","review"],"language":"en"},

Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111\u2013158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fantini, Jacques; Di Scala, Coralie; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/599f1404001c5dd7dfa941942f261909a8c3177a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128678.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301102; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","viral S protein","CLQ-OH","viral protein","presence of CLQ","study","sialic acids","attachment","novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus","repositioned drugs","binding domain","infected patients","receptor","host cell surface gangliosides","viral replication cycle","N-terminal domain","drug repositioning","clinical evaluation","silico approaches","clinical isolates","worldwide pandemic","innovative drug candidates","new mechanism of action","molecular modelling approaches","broad range of repositioned","surface of respiratory cells","new type of ganglioside","efficient therapy","tip","reliable option","contact","spike","treatment","lipid rafts","active derivative","combination of structural","global health emergency","delay","recent emergence","hydroxychloroquine","high affinity","entry","use","potential therapeutic targets","efficiency","identification","step","enzyme","angiotension","investigation"],"language":"en"},

By comparing synonymous codon usage patterns in different viruses, we observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in these virus genes was virus specific and phylogenetically conserved, but it was not host specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARSCoV was diverged far from all three known groups of Coronavirus.

Bats are identified as important wildlife hosts of many viruses capable of causing fatal human disease, including members of the henipaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses and filoviruses. As global warming and habitat change are thought to impact upon pathogen transmission dynamics and increase the risk of spillover, virus surveillance in bat populations remains a significant component of efforts to improve the prediction and control of potential future disease outbreaks caused by bat-borne viruses. In this study we have developed two fluid bead array assays containing customized panels that target multiple bat-borne viruses. These assays detect up to 11 viral RNA\u0027s simultaneously in urine samples collected from wild bat populations in Australia and Bangladesh. The assays developed show high specificity for the target viruses and the analytical sensitivity compares favorably to qRT-PCR. These assays enhance the ability to monitor multi-pathogen dynamics and identify patterns of virus shedding from bat populations, thus informing key approaches to outbreak response and control.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyd, Victoria; Smith, Ina; Crameri, Gary; Burroughs, Amy L.; Durr, Peter A.; White, John; Cowled, Christopher; Marsh, Glenn A.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02c47f9c17a219ee65eb190107c7992066401ba9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190638/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415002372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415002372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["wild bat populations","multiple bat","target viruses","viruses capable","Abstract Virus surveillance of wildlife populations","patterns of virus","fluid bead array assays","fatal human disease","multi-pathogen dynamics","important wildlife hosts","pathogen transmission dynamics","control of potential future disease outbreaks","potential threat","human health","customized panels","prediction","urine samples","key approaches","risk of spillover","henipaviruses","impact","members","significant component of efforts","habitat change","analytical sensitivity","coronaviruses","outbreak response","viral RNA\u0027s","animal","ability","Australia","Bangladesh","high specificity","global warming","rhabdoviruses","filoviruses","emergence of pathogens","Bats","monitoring","qRT-PCR","study"],"language":"en"},

Increasing evidence suggests a role for autophagy in inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, Crohn\u0027s disease, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. These studies suggest that modulating autophagy could be a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. Eosinophils are a major type of inflammatory cell that aggravates airway inflammatory diseases, particularly corticosteroid-resistant inflammation. The eosinophil count is a useful tool for assessing which patients may benefit from inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that autophagy plays a role in eosinophilic airway inflammatory diseases by promoting airway remodeling and loss of function. Genetic variant in the autophagy gene ATG5 is associated with asthma pathogenesis, and autophagy regulates apoptotic pathways in epithelial cells in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, autophagy dysfunction leads to severe inflammation, especially eosinophilic inflammation, in chronic rhinosinusitis. However, the mechanism underlying autophagy-mediated regulation of eosinophilic airway inflammation remains unclear. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the role of autophagy in eosinophilic airway inflammation. We also suggest that autophagy may be a new therapeutic target for airway inflammation, including that mediated by eosinophils.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jinju; Kim, Hun Sik","journal":"Immune Netw","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcd5c4f4081c90fa1c4672cbe00246e62dcc440a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838160/; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of autophagy","modulating autophagy","autophagy dysfunction","eosinophilic airway inflammatory diseases","eosinophilic inflammation","autophagy-mediated regulation of eosinophilic airway inflammation","autophagy gene ATG5","airway remodeling","severe inflammation","infectious diseases","corticosteroid-resistant inflammation","major type of inflammatory cell","Eosinophils","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Crohn\u0027s disease","pulmonary hypertension","chronic rhinosinusitis","homeostatic mechanism","Recent studies","novel therapeutic option","new therapeutic target","inhaled corticosteroid therapy","individuals","epithelial cells","apoptotic pathways","cystic fibrosis","asthma pathogenesis","denatured proteins","damaged organelles","patients","lysosomal degradation","useful tool","pathogens","Genetic variant","general overview","loss of function","eosinophil count","review","evidence","aim"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: To describe the current etiology of CAP in Malawi and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR. Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4\u201341.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17\u20135.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40\u20135.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48\u20136.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03\u20139.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72\u20137.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial\u2013viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19\u20135.01]). Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially vaccine-preventable pathogens.

Multiple viruses are detected during a single ARI episode in approximately a quarter of all cases. The clinical relevance of these multiple detections is unclear, as is the role of the individual virus. We therefore investigated the correlation between clinical data and RT-PCR results in children with single- and multiple viral ARI. METHODS: Data from children with ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons. RT-PCR testing for 15 viruses was performed in 560 ARI episodes. In the patients with a single-viral etiology, clinical data, laboratory findings, patient management- and outcome data were compared between the different viruses. With this information, we compared data from children of whom RT-PCR data were negative, with children with single- and multiple viral positive results. RESULTS: The viral detection rate was 457/560 (81.6%) of which 331/560 (59.1%) were single infections and 126/560 (22.5%) were multiple infections. In single viral infections, some statistically significant differences in demographics, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome were found between children with different viral etiologies. However, no clinically recognizable pattern was established to be virus-specific. In a multivariate analysis, the only variables that were correlated with longer hospital stay were the use of oxygen and nebulizer therapy, irrespective of the viral pathogen. Children with RT-PCR positive test results had a significant higher disease severity, fever, length of hospital stay, days of extra oxygen supply, and days of antibiotic treatment than children with a negative RT-PCR test result. For children with single- versus children with multiple positive RT-PCR test results, these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Disease (severity), management and outcome in pediatric ARI are not associated with a specific virus. Single- and multiple viral ARI do not significantly differ with regard to clinical outcome and patient management. For general pediatrics, RT-PCR assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available or otherwise may have clinical consequences. Further research with an extended panel of RT-PCR assays and a larger number of inclusions is necessary to further validate our findings.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, some of which have been known to cause common colds. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation from person-to-person and aerosol/droplet transmission, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of COVID-19 patients but in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kitajima, Masaaki; Ahmed, Warish; Bibby, Kyle; Carducci, Annalaura; Gerba, Charles P.; Hamilton, Kerry A.; Haramoto, Eiji; Rose, Joan B.","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/732c31132a3d0355f17cc90b736a0a012e31f1b3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325936?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325936; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","quantification of SARS","presence of SARS","wastewater samples","potential role of wastewater","potential of wastewater surveillance","risk assessments of SARS","human health risk assessment of SARS","major transmission routes of SARS","ongoing COVID","feces of COVID","epidemiology of COVID","human health risks","presence of viral RNA","relevant respiratory viruses","potential sources of epidemiological data","person","droplet transmission","detection","methodologies","available evidence","available data","World Health Organization","quantitative microbial risk assessment","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","information relevant","QMRA parameters","single-stranded RNA genome","knowledge gaps","major challenges","current knowledge","urgent need","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease","group of enveloped viruses","evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms","lack","previous studies","persistence","aerosol","research","infections","occurrence","outbreak","implications","inhalation","modeling-based approaches","family Coronaviridae","standardized protocol","removal","member","impact","patients","exposure pathways","understanding","common colds"],"language":"en"},

The system implies physical contact between the skin and the surface of the fingerprint\u2010capturing and reading devices. AIM: To assess the risk of infection transmission through fingerprinting. METHODS: The medical literature was reviewed for the potential of microorganisms to be carried on the skin of hands in the community, to be transferred from hands to inanimate surfaces, to survive on surfaces, and to be transferred in doses exceeding the infectious dose. The fingerprinting procedures as currently applied were reviewed. RESULTS: Factors that favor transfer of microorganisms are large skin\u2013surface contact between flat fingers (2 \u00D7 20 cm(2)) and fingerprint\u2010capturing device, nonporous contact surface, large overlap of contact surface and short turnaround time between successive applicants, high contact pressure, and difficulties to disinfect devices. Transmission risk exists for enteric viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, and hepatitis A virus), respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenzavirus, etc.), and enteropathogenic bacteria with low infectious doses (Shigella dysenteriae, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, etc.). Using Monte Carlo risk analysis on US data, transmission of human rotavirus is estimated at 191 [95% credible intervals (CI) 0\u2013289] per million fingerprint\u2010capturing procedures. Application of 70% isopropyl hand rub and 85% ethanol hand gel reduces the risk to 77 (95% CI 0\u2013118) and 0.3 (95% CI 0\u20130.3) transmissions per million procedures, respectively.

Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

METHODS: In our study, 102 volunteers experiencing upper airway infection were recruited over the winter and early spring of 2008/2009 and the first half of the winter of 2009/2010. Ninety-nine EBCs were successfully obtained and screened for 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses. To investigate the efficiency of virus isolation from EBC, a nasal swab was taken in parallel from a subset of volunteers. The combined use of the ECoVent device with the RTube\u2122 allowed the registration of the exhaled volume and breathing frequency during collection. In this way, the number of exhaled viral particles per liter air or per minute can theoretically be estimated. RESULTS: Viral screening resulted in the detection of 4 different viruses in EBC and/or nasal swabs: Rhinovirus, Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus B, Influenza A and Influenza B. Rhinovirus was detected in 6 EBCs and 1 EBC was Influenza B positive. We report a viral detection rate of 7% for the EBCs, which is much lower than the detection rate of 46.8% observed using nasal swabs.

PEDV was first detected in the U.S. in May 2013 and spread rapidly across the country. Some serological assays for PEDV have been previously described, but few were readily available in the U.S. Several U.S. laboratories quickly developed indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays for the detection of antibodies to PEDV in swine serum, indicating prior exposure. However, the IFA has several disadvantages, including low throughput and relatively subjective interpretation. Different serologic test formats have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the questions being asked, so a full repertoire of tests is useful. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate multiple improved serological assays for PEDV, including an indirect ELISA (iELISA); a highly specific monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA); fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) that can be multiplexed to monitor exposure to multiple antigens and pathogens simultaneously; and a fluorescent focus neutralization assay (FFN) to measure functional virus neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: A recombinant North American nucleoprotein (NP) based iELISA was developed and validated along with a bELISA using newly developed PEDV-NP specific biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and an FMIA using magnetic beads coupled with expressed NA PEDV-NP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using swine serum samples (iELISA n = 1486, bELISA n = 1186, FMIA n = 1420). The ROC analysis for the FMIA showed estimated sensitivity and specificity of 98.2 and 99.2 %, respectively. The iELISA and bELISA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 97.6 %; and 98.2 and 98.9 %, respectively. Inter-rater (kappa) agreement was calculated to be 0.941 between iELISA and IFA, 0.945 between bELISA and IFA and 0.932 between FMIA and IFA. Similar comparative kappa values were observed between the iELISA, bELISA and FMIA, which demonstrated a significant level of testing agreement among the three assays. No cross-reactivity with the closely related coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was noted with these assays. All three assays detected seroconversion of na\u00EFve animals within 6\u20139 days post exposure. The FFN assay allows relative quantitation of functional neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. CONCLUSION: Well-validated iELISA, bELISA and FMIA assays for the detection of PEDV antibodies were developed and showed good correlation with IFA and each other. Each assay format has advantages that dictate how they will be used in the field. Newly developed mAbs to the PEDV-NP were used in the bELISA and for expediting FFN testing in the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, these PEDV mAbs are useful for immunohistochemistry, fluorescent antibody staining and other antigen-based tests. Measurement of neutralizing antibody responses using the FFN assay may provide a valuable tool for assessment of vaccine candidates or protective immunity.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okda, Faten; Liu, Xiaodong; Singrey, Aaron; Clement, Travis; Nelson, Julie; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric A.; Lawson, Steven","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d78b99436685b3f545dedc32f1166776b916abd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4522128.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0500-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IFA","FMIA","NA","FFN"],"locations":["Asia","U.S.","North America"],"keyphrases":["PEDV mAbs","FMIA assays","detection of PEDV antibodies","IFA","bELISA n","FMIA n","iELISA n","detection of antibodies","developed PEDV-NP specific biotinylated monoclonal antibodies","expressed NA PEDV-NP","FFN assay","quantitation of neutralizing antibodies","Well-validated iELISA","developed mAbs","identification of PEDV infected animals","indirect fluorescent antibody","fluorescent antibody staining","functional virus","relative quantitation of functional neutralizing antibodies","multiple improved serological assays","fluorescent focus neutralization assay","Measurement of neutralizing antibody responses","assay format","specific monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA","swine serum samples","expediting FFN testing","antigen-based tests","well-validated diagnostic tests","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","fluorescent microsphere immunoassays","indirect ELISA","ROC analysis","disadvantages","repertoire of tests","prior exposure","specificity","severe outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","days post exposure","colostrum samples","estimated sensitivity","significant level of testing agreement","multiple antigens","porcine respiratory coronavirus","seroconversion of na\u00EFve animals","recombinant North American nucleoprotein","Similar comparative kappa values","TGEV","need","assessment of vaccine candidates","related coronaviruses","valuable tool","evaluation","Asia","milk","immunohistochemistry","magnetic beads","pathogens","Different serologic test formats","low throughput","immune status","protective immunity","RESULTS","PRCV","laboratories","CONCLUSION","good correlation","subjective interpretation","BACKGROUND","Receiver","characteristic","addition","cross-reactivity","study","objective","questions","country","field"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions. Evidence based knowledge is essential to implement effective strategies in hospital. This review focused on the use of animal programs for hospitalized patients, and considered the potential risks. METHODS: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, PsychInfo, Ebsco Animals, PROQUEST, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE, and PRISMA guidelines were adhered to. RESULTS: Out of 432 articles were identified 36 articles suitable for inclusion into the review. Data was heterogeneous in terms of age of patient, health issue, animals used and the length of interactions, which made comparison problematic. Studies on children, psychiatric and elderly patients were the most common. The animal-intervention programs suggested various benefits such as reducing stress, pain and anxiety. Other outcomes considered were changes in vital signs, and nutritional intake. Most studies used dogs, but other animals were effectively employed. The major risks outlined were allergies, infections and animal-related accidents. Zoonosis was a possible risk, as well as common infections as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. The implementation of simple hygiene protocols was effective at minimizing risk. The literature suggested that the benefits outweighed by far the risks. CONCLUSION: The human relationship with animals can be useful and relatively safe for inpatients with various problems. Moreover, the implementation of security precautions and the careful selection of patients should minimize the risks, particularly those infection-related.

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations\u0027 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Deyi; Bolan, Nanthi S.; Tsang, Daniel C.W.; Kirkham, Mary B.; O\u0027Connor, David","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2bd0f08f8aa0b55c0217d9ed9721182798f1d82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138961; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324785?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Earth"],"keyphrases":["soil pollution","Abstract Soil","soil degradation","field of sustainable soil","sustainable soil management practices","soil data collection","optimizing soil health","formation of innovative sustainable soil","soil organic carbon levels","multifunctional value of soil health","SDGs","sustainable behavior of practitioners","carbon sequestration","management strategies","information management","based data collection","biodiversity","big data","recalcitrant forms of carbon","United Nations\u0027 Sustainable Development Goals","new knowledge","knowledge sharing","scientific knowledge","largest terrestrial carbon pool","interdisciplinary linkages","climate crisis","climate change","Interdisciplinary studies","social learning process","machine","plant growth","animal habitation","important actors","agricultural production","major issues","key component of Earth\u0027s critical zone","G telecommunications","erosion","factors","environmental quality","policy makers","essential services","analytical tools","significant contributor of greenhouse gases","Scientists","close collaboration","farmers","places","salinization","governmental funding","identified option","progress","advances","actions","target date","evidence","end-users","world","research","biochar application","farming community","soils","acidification","order","manner"],"language":"en"},

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) capsid protein has recently been shown to be phosphorylated at four residues. Here those studies are extended to determine the kinase responsible for phosphorylation and the importance of capsid phosphorylation during the viral life cycle. Phosphorylation site prediction software suggests that Protein Kinase C (PKC) is responsible for phosphorylation of VEEV capsid. VEEV capsid co-immunoprecipitated with PKC\u03B4, but not other PKC isoforms and siRNA knockdown of PKC\u03B4 caused a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, knockdown of PKC\u03B4 by siRNA decreased capsid phosphorylation. A virus with capsid phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (VEEV CPD) displayed a lower genomic copy to pfu ratio than the parental virus; suggesting more efficient viral assembly and more infectious particles being released. RNA:capsid binding was significantly increased in the mutant virus, confirming these results. Finally, VEEV CPD is attenuated in a mouse model of infection, with mice showing increased survival and decreased clinical signs as compared to mice infected with the parental virus.

Archaeal viruses isolated from these hot habitats usually have double-stranded DNA genomes, linear or circular, and can infect members of the Archaea domain. In this study, the synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB) and dinucleotide composition in the available complete archaeal virus genome sequences have been investigated. It was found that there is a significant variation in SCUB among different Archaeal virus species, which is mainly determined by the base composition. The outcome of correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman\u05F3s rank correlation analysis shows that codon usage of selected archaeal virus genes depends mainly on GC richness of genome, and the gene\u05F3s function, albeit with smaller effects, also contributes to codon usage in this virus. Furthermore, this investigation reveals that aromaticity of each protein is also critical in affecting SCUB of these viral genes although it was less important than that of the mutational bias. Especially, mutational pressure may influence SCUB in SIRV1, SIRV2, ARV1, AFV1, and PhiCh1 viruses, whereas translational selection could play a leading role in HRPV1\u05F3s SCUB. These conclusions not only can offer an insight into the codon usage biases of archaeal virus and subsequently the possible relationship between archaeal viruses and their host, but also may help in understanding the evolution of archaeal viruses and their gene classification, and more helpful to explore the origin of life and the evolution of biology.","publish_time":"2014-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Sen; Yang, Jie","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b582a1fd39191ffdd515a4c909a446bce345165b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685889/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.03.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519314001611; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519314001611","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of archaeal viruses","codon usage biases of archaeal virus","s SCUB","codon usage of selected archaeal virus genes","different Archaeal virus species","divergent viruses","PhiCh1 viruses","available complete archaeal virus genome sequences","synonymous codon usage bias","s function","mutational bias","s rank correlation analysis","dinucleotide composition","viral genes","gene classification","base composition","mutational pressure","evolution of biology","GC richness of genome","outcome of correspondence analysis","Spearman","heated aquatic ecosystems","double-stranded DNA genomes","COA","SIRV1","leading role","ARV1","hot habitats","possible relationship","AFV1","translational selection","Abstract Recent studies","smaller effects","significant variation","protein","SIRV2","HRPV1","insight","study","origin of life","members","aromaticity","unusual morphotypes","host","Archaea domain","investigation","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

PCR or reverse transcription\u2010PCR was performed to detect 14 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from September 2007 to August 2008 in Changsha, China. HRV was detected in 202 (17.3%) of the 1,165 children; 25.3% of the HRV\u2010positive children were 13\u201336 months of age (\u03C7(2) = 22.803, P = 0.000). HRV was detected year round and peaked between September and December. Fifty\u2010three percent of the HRV\u2010positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common secondary virus. Phylogenetic analysis using the VP4/VP2 region grouped the HRV\u2010positive strains as follows: 101 HRV\u2010A (50.0%), 21 HRV\u2010B (10.4%), and 80 HRV\u2010C (39.6%). HRV\u2010A infections occurred predominantly in spring and autumn, and the peak prevalence of HRV\u2010C was in early winter and late autumn. HRV\u2010B infections were less common in spring (\u03C7(2) = 31.914, P = 0.000). No significant difference in clinical severity or presentation was found between patients with HRV single infection and HRV co\u2010detections.

These results suggest that HRV\u2010C is an important viral agent along with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010B and that among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in China, the three HRV genotypes have similar clinical characteristics.

While HCT dendrograms tend to optimize local coherent clustering patterns, SVD leading eigenvectors usually identify better global grouping and transitional structures. RESULTS: This study proposes a flipping mechanism for a conventional agglomerative HCT using a rank-two ellipse (R2E, an improved SVD algorithm for sorting purpose) seriation by Chen [3] as an external reference. While HCTs always produce permutations with good local behaviour, the rank-two ellipse seriation gives the best global grouping patterns and smooth transitional trends. The resulting algorithm automatically integrates the desirable properties of each method so that users have access to a clustering and visualization environment for gene expression profiles that preserves coherent local clusters and identifies global grouping trends. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, through four examples, that the proposed method not only possesses better numerical and statistical properties, it also provides more meaningful biomedical insights than other sorting algorithms. We suggest that sorted proximity matrices for genes and arrays, in addition to the gene-by-array expression matrix, can greatly aid in the search for comprehensive understanding of gene expression structures.

A genuinely sustainable society is one that initiates developments in sustainable ways. The development of a genuinely sustainable society is supported by its citizens who think and act according to a recognized code of conduct - the sustainable culture. Similar to other forms of culture, sustainable culture of a society is not static, but changes over time. The changes found in a sustainable culture are reflections of the status of sustainability in a society and these changes should be measured from time to time. The resulting measurement gives very important information for decision-makers, in the government and in the private sector, to examine the magnitude of changes that have taken place in a given period of time. The results will also enable them to review and adjust policies in order to better accommodate changes according to the trends of society. This paper provides a method \u2013 the T-model, to investigate and measure the extent of change of sustainable culture through two extensive surveys among participants of the construction industry of Hong Kong. The change in sustainable culture is reflected by the change in attitude and practice among construction participants, this can be found in their performance in project development, design and construction operations.

Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. METHODS: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). RESULTS: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. DISCUSSION: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. CONCLUSION: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santana, Rui; Sousa, Joana Santos; Soares, Patr\u00EDcia; Lopes, S\u00EDlvia; Boto, Paulo; Rocha, Jo\u00E3o Victor","journal":"Portuguese Journal of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c4af9ef29060691e32b7e953fd340cb350d718a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206358.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507764","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alentejo"],"organizations":["SARS","National Health Service","Transparency Portal","NHS","Regional Health Administration","Manchester Triage System"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["number of emergency episodes","emergency care episodes","number of episodes","use of emergency services","emergency department","number of emergency service use","evolution of emergency services","reduction of demand","highest reduction","mainland Portugal","cases of COVID","historical data","RHA","pandemic month","SARS pandemic","Alentejo","MTS","RESULTS","analysis","forecasted values","National Health Service","smallest decrease","fewer COVID","preliminary study","Previous studies","previous pandemics","historical records","NHS monitoring website","Regional Health Administration","Transparency Portal","plan interventions","clinical characteristics","deaths","Manchester Triage System","unnecessary morbidities","significant drop","evidence","delayed visit","area","yellow","phenomenon","association","beginning","METHODS","CONCLUSION","DISCUSSION","difference","end","objective","causes","INTRODUCTION","Information"],"language":"en"},

To reveal the underlying mechanism, we also study a simplified model that focuses on how a major railway affects an epidemic. We assume that the individuals, when they travel, take on the shortest path to the destination and become non-travelers upon arrival. When an infection process co-evolves with the traveling dynamics, the railway serves to gather a crowd, transmit the disease, and spread infected agents to local area subnetworks. The railway leads to a faster initial increase in infected agents and a higher steady state infection, and thus poses risks; and frequent traveling leads to a more severe infection. These features revealed in simulations are in agreement with analytic results of a simplified version of the model.","publish_time":"2013-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruan, Zhongyuan; Hui, Pakming; Lin, Haiqing; Liu, Zonghua","journal":"Eur Phys J B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4551039a263d47c0556cc8b3b8b05268d050aa6d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2012-30292-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network model","railway network poses","major railway","simplified model","infected agents","risks","local area subnetworks","severe infection","traveling dynamics","frequent traveling","local-area transportation subnetworks","infection process co-","higher steady state infection","simplified version","epidemic outbreak","construction of high speed rails systems","USA","faster initial increase","destination","Japan","agreement","analytic results","case","huge investments","simulations","non-travelers","arrival","disease","layers","shortest path","view","features","China","crowd","underlying mechanism","individuals"],"language":"en"},

Here, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that human and mouse IFIT1 have evolved distinct functions using a combination of evolutionary, genetic and virological analyses. First, we show that human IFIT1 and mouse IFIT1 (renamed IFIT1B) are not orthologs, but are paralogs that diverged \u003E100 mya. Second, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins differ in their ability to be suppressed by a cap 2\u0027O-methyltransferase.

In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activities and the mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, an effective dose of Angelica tenuissima Nakai markedly inhibited the replication of Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Coxsackie virus, and Enterovirus (EV-71) on epithelial (HEK293T/HeLa) and immune (RAW264.7) cells. Such inhibition can be described by the induction of the antiviral state in cells by antiviral, IFNrelated gene induction and secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated BALB/c mice displayed higher survivability and lower lung viral titers when challenged with lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, and H9N2). We also found that Angelica tenuissima Nakai can induce the secretion of IL-6, IFN-\u03BB, and local IgA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated mice, which correlating with the observed prophylactic effects.

Several hundred species of viruses have been recovered from humans, who are the best-studied vertebrate hosts and new ones are still occasionally discovered. Somewhat fewer have been recovered from each of the common species of farm and companion animals and from the commonly used laboratory animals. To simplify the study of this vast number of infectious agents, these are sorted into groups that share certain common properties. The most important criteria for classification are the physical and chemical characteristics of the virion and the mode of replication of the virus. The chapter explains a formal viral taxonomy, which is based on these criteria.","publish_time":"1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

To examine the hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens (i.e. protozoa (2), pathogenic bacteria (4) human viruses, (8) and bovine viruses (8)) eight rivers were monitored in the Great Lakes Basin over 29 months from February 2011 to June 2013. Sampling locations represented a wide variety of land cover classes from urban to agriculture to forest. A custom automated pathogen sampler was deployed at eight sampling locations which provided unattended, flow-weighted, large-volume (120\u20131630 L) sampling. Human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria were detected by real-time qPCR in 16%, 14%, and 1.4% of 290 samples collected while protozoa were never detected. The most frequently detected pathogens were: bovine polyomavirus (11%), and human adenovirus C, D, F (9%). Human and bovine viruses were present in 16.9% and 14.8% of runoff-event samples (n = 189) resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 13.9% and 12.9% of low-flow samples (n = 101), respectively, indicating multiple delivery mechanisms could be influential. Data indicated human and bovine virus prevalence was different depending on land cover within the watershed. Occurrence, concentration, and flux of human viruses were greatest in samples from the three sampling locations with greater than 25% urban influence than those with less than 25% urban influence. Similarly, occurrence, concentration, and flux of bovine viruses were greatest in samples from the two sampling locations with greater than 50 cattle/km2 than those with less than 50 cattle/km2. In seasonal analysis, human and bovine viruses occurred more frequently in spring and winter seasons than during the fall and summer.

Using content analysis of texts from newspaper and TV, government agencies, municipalities, government and parliament, non-governmental organizations, and companies, we analyze the argumentation in the Swedish public controversy over antibacterial silver and relate the findings to environmental and sustainability assessments. We conclude that silver is regarded as either beneficial or harmful in relation to four main values: the environment, health, sewage treatment, and product effectiveness. Various arguments are used to support positive and negative evaluations of silver, revealing several contradictory reasons for considering silver beneficial or harmful. Current environmental and sustainability assessments (i.e. substance flow analysis, risk analysis, multi-criteria analysis, and lifecycle assessment) cover many of the concerns raised in the public controversy over antibacterial silver and can therefore inform the debate regarding its toxicity, emissions, and environmental impact. However, not all concerns raised in the public controversy are covered by current environmental and sustainability assessments, most notably, concerns over public health and bacterial resistance issues are not paid full attention. For future environmental and sustainability assessments to make an even more significant societal contribution and to inform consumers and decision-makers about concerns articulated in the public debate, a wider range of issues concerning antibacterial silver needs to be considered through a unified framework.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boholm, Max; Arvidsson, Rickard","journal":"Journal of Cleaner Production","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7042a3cab0be78753ef102a5e909c03157514d27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135433.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288346/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652613009128; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652613009128; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibacterial silver needs","public debate","concerns","sustainability assessments","public health","Swedish public controversy","negative evaluations of silver","environmental impact","risk analysis","antibacterial agent","multi-criteria analysis","substance flow analysis","content analysis of texts","government agencies","wider range of issues","bacterial resistance issues","parliament","consumers","municipalities","newspaper","TV","lifecycle assessment","non-governmental organizations","sewage treatment","main values","healthcare products","contradictory reasons","findings","companies","relation","benefits","decision-makers","toxicity","emissions","argumentation","cover","nanosilver","significant societal contribution","product effectiveness","potential risks","Various arguments","attention","unified framework"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of children hospitalised with LRTIs at a tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and to investigate the role and impact of ACT in these children. METHOD: A retrospective folder review of children hospitalised with LRTI between January and June 2015 was conducted, extracting data on demographic characteristics, health condition, ACT interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1208 individual cases (median [IQR] age 7.6 (2.8\u201319.0) months), in 1440 hospitalisations, were included. The majority of children were hospitalised primarily for the management of bronchiolitis. Comorbidities were present in 52.6% of patients during at least one of their hospitalisations. Airway clearance therapy was administered in 5.9% (n = 85) of admissions, most commonly conventional (manual) ACT. Transient oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was reported in six children, and one child developed lobar collapse an hour post-treatment. No other adverse events were reported. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 2.3 (1.5\u20135.0) days, and the overall mortality rate was 0.7%. Children hospitalised for presumed nosocomial infections and pneumonia had the longest length of stay, were more likely to receive ACT and had the highest mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Airway clearance therapy was infrequently used in this population and was more commonly applied in those with nosocomial LRTI and pneumonia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although ACT was generally well tolerated, safety has not been ascertained, and oxygen saturation should be carefully monitored during therapy.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corten, Lieselotte; Morrow, Brenda M.","journal":"S Afr J Physiother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a29854dea098c27aed6012be2e0c3efa740765cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7059502.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["outcomes of children","majority of children","ACT interventions","impact of ACT","nature of airway clearance therapy","retrospective folder review of children","LRTIs","median","pneumonia","IQR","nosocomial LRTI","hospitalisations","presumed nosocomial infections","overall mortality rate","highest mortality rate","demographic characteristics","patient outcomes","lower respiratory tract infections","health condition","lobar collapse","tertiary paediatric hospital","South Africa","individual cases","frequency","hour post-treatment","longest length of stay","total","data","role","admissions","METHOD","prescription","days","duration of hospitalisation","manual","CONCLUSION","Transient oxyhaemoglobin desaturation","RESULTS","patients","CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS","oxygen saturation","management of bronchiolitis","adverse events","Comorbidities","months","OBJECTIVES","population","safety","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The growing demand of dengue diagnostics especially in low-resource settings gave rise to many rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). This study evaluated the accuracy and utility of ViroTrack Dengue Acute - a new biosensors-based dengue NS1 RDT, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1/IgM/IgG combo - a commercially available RDT, and SD Dengue NS1 Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for the diagnosis of acute dengue infection. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study consecutively recruited 494 patients with suspected dengue from a health clinic in Malaysia. Both RDTs were performed onsite. The evaluated ELISA and reference tests were performed in a virology laboratory. The reference tests comprised of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and three ELISAs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The diagnostic performance of evaluated tests was computed using STATA version 12. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of ViroTrack were 62.3% (95%CI 55.6\u201368.7) and 95.0% (95%CI 91.7\u201397.3), versus 66.5% (95%CI 60.0\u201372.6) and 95.4% (95%CI 92.1\u201397.6) for SD NS1 ELISA, and 52.4% (95%CI 45.7\u201359.1) and 97.7% (95%CI 95.1\u201399.2) for NS1 component of SD Bioline, respectively. The combination of the latter with its IgM and IgG components were able to increase test sensitivity to 82.4% (95%CI 76.8\u201387.1) with corresponding decrease in specificity to 87.4% (95%CI 82.8\u201391.2). Although a positive test on any of the NS1 assays would increase the probability of dengue to above 90% in a patient, a negative result would only reduce this probability to 23.0\u201329.3%. In contrast, this probability of false negative diagnosis would be further reduced to 14.7% (95%CI 11.4\u201318.6) if SD Bioline NS1/IgM/IgG combo was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of ViroTrack Dengue Acute was comparable to SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. Addition of serology components to SD Bioline Dengue Duo significantly improved its sensitivity and reduced its false negative rate such that it missed the fewest dengue patients, making it a better point-of-care diagnostic tool. New RDT like ViroTrack Dengue Acute may be a potential alternative to existing RDT if its combination with serology components is proven better in future studies.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Zhuo Lin; Sekaran, Shamala Devi; Soe, Hui Jen; Peramalah, Devi; Rampal, Sanjay; Ng, Chiu-Wan","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/986a58195b90d64e7b64f85d437abbedce0f7313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7069157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ViroTrack Dengue Acute","SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1/IgM/IgG","SD Dengue NS1 Ag","STATA","SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["probability of dengue","suspected dengue","SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1","SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA","SD Bioline NS1","SD NS1 ELISA","detection of dengue NS1 antigen","performance of ViroTrack Dengue Acute","utility of ViroTrack Dengue Acute","fewest dengue patients","new biosensors-based dengue NS1 RDT","diagnosis of acute dengue infection","NS1 component of SD Bioline","NS1 assays","SD Dengue NS1 Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","growing demand of dengue diagnostics","IgM","New RDT","IgG components","evaluated ELISA","available RDT","existing RDT","IgG combo","reference tests","specificity of ViroTrack","diagnostic performance of evaluated tests","probability of false negative diagnosis","rapid diagnostic tests","IgG antibodies","test sensitivity","negative result","false negative rate","Addition of serology components","combination","care diagnostic tool","better point","positive test","prospective cross-sectional study","low-resource settings","rise","ELISAs","potential alternative","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","accuracy","health clinic","emerging infectious disease","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Malaysia","STATA version","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","future studies","corresponding decrease","virology laboratory","RESULTS","people","RDTs"],"language":"en"},

For safety reasons, modern vaccinology tends toward the usage of inactivated or attenuated microorganisms and uses predominantly subunit vaccines. The antigens need to be clearly defined, pure, stable, appropriately composed, and properly presented to the immune system of the host. Differing ratios of various proportions between specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cell responses are essential for conferring the required protection in the case of individual vaccines. To stimulate both CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells, the antigens must be processed and presented to both antigen-presentation pathways, MHC I and MHC II. Protein antigens delivered by vaccination are processed as extracellular antigens. However, extracellularly delivered antigen can be directed towards intracellular presentation pathways in conjugation with molecules involved in antigen cross-presentation, e.g. heat shock proteins, or by genomic-DNA vaccination. In this overview, current knowledge of the host immune response to DNA vaccines is summarized in the introduction. The subsequent sections discuss techniques for enhancing DNA vaccine efficacy, such as DNA delivery to specific tissues, delivery of DNA to the cell cytoplasm or nucleus, and enhancement of the immune response using molecular adjuvants.

In the absence of counterterrorism intelligence information, public health authorities can also base their preparedness on the agents for which the national health structures would be most vulnerable. This article aims to describe a logical method and the characteristics of the variables to be brought in a weighing process to reach a priority list for preparedness. The European Union, in the aftermath of the anthrax events of October 2001 in the United States, set up a task force of experts from multiple member states to elaborate and implement a health security programme.

During the first three quarters, 46 infectious diseases were covered, including mandatory reports of measles and meningococcal meningitis and outbreaks of cowpox, which does not have to be notified in Germany. Results of a targeted evaluation and a consistently high attendance rate both indicate that the teleconference has met additional needs for supplemental information exchange among participants.

This combination can be considered as a bioreactor that is produced by introducing foreign genes into plants that elicit special immunogenicity when introduced into animals or human beings. In comparison with traditional vaccines, plant vaccines have some significant advantages, such as low cost, greater safety, and greater effectiveness. In a number of recent studies, antigen-specific proteins have been successfully expressed in various plant tissues and have even been tested in animals and human beings. Therefore, edible vaccines of transgenic plants have a bright future. This review begins with a discussion of the immune mechanism and expression systems for transgenic plant vaccines. Then, current advances in different transgenic plant vaccines will be analyzed, including vaccines against pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic parasites. In view of the low expression levels for antigens in plants, high-level expression strategies of foreign protein in transgenic plants are recommended. Finally, the existing safety problems in transgenic plant vaccines were put forward will be discussed along with a number of appropriate solutions that will hopefully lead to future clinical application of edible plant vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Zheng-jun; Guo, Bin; Huo, Yan-lin; Guan, Zheng-ping; Dai, Jia-kun; Wei, Ya-hui","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f85045999d4040e8ec330b861f676b07c817122f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080054.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080054/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transgenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different transgenic plant vaccines","Transgenic plant-derived vaccines","edible vaccines of transgenic plants","traditional vaccines","future clinical application of edible plant vaccines","various plant tissues","plant genetic engineering technology","expression systems","low expression levels","greater safety","animals","human beings","high-level expression strategies of foreign protein","low cost","foreign genes","bright future","greater effectiveness","new type of bioreactor","existing safety problems","number of recent studies","number of appropriate solutions","antigens","immune mechanism","significant advantages","organism\u0027s immunological response","bacteria","special immunogenicity","antigen-specific proteins","current advances","pathogenic viruses","discussion","comparison","eukaryotic parasites","review","combination"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: An epidemiological study conducted over 3 years. SETTING: A 12-bed intensive care unit (ICU). PARTICIPANTS: ICU patients over 45 years of age with a primary diagnosis of COPD exacerbation requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or ventilation via endotracheal tube (ETT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and posterior pharyngeal swabs (PS) were tested for viruses with immunofluorescence assay (IFA), virus culture (VC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Paired virus and atypical pneumonia serology assays were taken. Blood, sputum and endotracheal aspirates were cultured for bacteria. RESULTS: 107 episodes in 105 patients were recorded. Twenty-three (21%) died within 28 days. A probable infectious aetiology was found in 69 patient episodes (64%). A virus was identified in 46 cases (43%), being the sole organism in 35 cases (33%) and part of a mixed infection in 11 cases (10%). A probable bacterial aetiology was found in 25 cases (23%). There was no statistically significant difference in clinical characteristics or outcomes between the group with virus infections and that without. CONCLUSION: Forty-six (43%) of the patients with COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation had a probable viral pathogen. Prodromal, clinical and outcome parameters did not distinguish virus from non-virus illness. PCR was the most sensitive whilst virus culture was the least of virus assays.

According to its essential role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been implicated in several pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopathies. More recently, autophagy has been described as a mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. In this context, autophagy has been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. This is strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy regulation. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert IFN-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit. This review provides an overview of the autophagic process and its involvement in the infection by different viral pathogens and of the connections existing between autophagy and proteins involved in IFN signalling pathways.","publish_time":"2007-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Espert, Lucile; Codogno, Patrice; Biard-Piechaczyk, Martine","journal":"J Mol Med (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ced1fa0df4d9db5abbb0e129b5463d0a4edf1217.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy regulation","IFN signalling pathways","IFN-mediated pathways","viral infection","different viral pathogens","viruses","cellular process","long-lived proteins","different stimuli","autophagic process","cellular homeostasis","protective mechanism","adaptive immunity","intracellular bacteria","involvement","interferon","connections","evolved strategies","induction","response","pathologies","essential role","cancer","neurodegeneration","myopathies","overview","degradation","review","suppression","organelles","fact","autolysosomes","benefit","context"],"language":"en"},

While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong. We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E. In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56\u00B0C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60\u00B0C for at least 30 min must be used. Different fixation procedures, e.g. for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective. Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely. Nevertheless, the agent\u2019s tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.","publish_time":"2004-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabenau, H.

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retroviruses which have been integrated into germ-line cells and inherited from parents to offspring. Most ERVs are inactivated by deletions and mutations; however, certain ERVs maintain their infectivity and infect the same host and new hosts as exogenous retroviruses. All domestic cats have infectious ERVs, termed RD-114 virus. Several canine and feline attenuated vaccines are manufactured using RD-114 virus-producing cell lines such as Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells; therefore, it is possible that infectious RD-114 virus contaminates live attenuated vaccines. Recently, Japanese and UK research groups found that several feline and canine vaccines were indeed contaminated with infectious RD-114 virus. This was the first incidence of contamination of \u2018infectious\u2019 ERVs in live attenuated vaccines. RD-114 virus replicates efficiently in canine cell lines and primary cells. Therefore, it is possible that RD-114 virus infects dogs following inoculation with contaminated vaccines and induces proliferative diseases and immune suppression, if it adapts to grow efficiently in dogs. In this review, we summarize the incidence of contamination of RD-114 virus in live attenuated vaccines and potential risks of infection with RD-114 virus in dogs.

In MARC-145 cells, both IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B2 transcript abundance were unaffected by PRRSV infection.

After activation, various TLR pathways can promote iNOS production via the myeloid differentiation primary response-88 (MyD-88) adapter protein. Subsequently, iNOS facilitates production of nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive and potent antiviral molecule that can inhibit replication of RNA and DNA viruses.

BVDV has been grouped into two genotypes, genotype 1 and genotype 2. In this study, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values and nucleotide content were investigated, and a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for open reading frames (ORFs) of 22 BVDV genomes, including 14 of genotype 1 and 8 of genotype 2, was carried out. A high A\u002BU content and low codon bias were found in BVDV genomes. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage between the two genotypes, and a geographic factor exists only in genotype-1 of BVDV. The RSCU data have a negative correlation with general average hydrophobicity (GRAVY), aromaticity and nucleotide content. Furthermore, the overall abundance of C and U has no effect on the synonymous codon usage patterns. In contrast, the A and G content showed a significant correlation with the nucleotide content at the third position. In addition, the codon usage patterns of BVDV are similar to those of 22 conserved genes of Bos taurus. Taken together, the genetic characteristics of BVDV possibly result from interactions between natural seclection and mutation pressure.

Every enrolled child had a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) sample taken. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect 1b gene of HCoV-NL63. A total of 539 NPAs were collected. Seven (1.3%) were positive for HCoV-NL63. All cases were boys younger than 3 years of age and most cases occurred in autumn. Co-infection with other pathogens was observed in three cases. The most common symptoms/signs of HCoV-NL63 infection were cough, fever, and inspiratory stridor. HCoV-NL63 was the most common pathogen (14.7%) in children with croup and was the cause of three cases of croup in October.

Private individuals routinely mitigate infectious disease risks through the adoption of a range of precautions, from vaccination to changes in their contact with others. Such precautions have epidemiological consequences. Private disease-risk mitigation generally reduces both peak prevalence of symptomatic infection and the number of people who fall ill. At the same time, however, it can prolong an epidemic. A reduction in prevalence is socially beneficial. Prolongation of an epidemic is not. We find that for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially suboptimal\u2014either too low or too high. The social optimum requires either more or less private mitigation. Since private mitigation effort depends on the cost of mitigation and the cost of illness, interventions that change either of these costs may be used to alter mitigation decisions. We model the potential for instruments that affect the cost of illness to yield net social benefits. We find that where a disease is not very infectious or the duration of illness is short, it may be socially optimal to promote private mitigation effort by increasing the cost of illness. By contrast, where a disease is highly infectious or long lasting, it may be optimal to discourage private mitigation by reducing the cost of disease. Society would prefer a shorter, more intense, epidemic to a longer, less intense epidemic. There is, however, a region in parameter space where the relationship is more complicated. For moderately infectious diseases with medium infectious periods, the social optimum depends on interactions between prevalence and duration. Basic reproduction numbers are not sufficient to predict the social optimum.","publish_time":"2017-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morin, B. R.; Kinzig, A. P.; Levin, S. A.; Perrings, C.

Here, we determined the roles of NF\u03BAB activation in aldosterone-induced kidney injury. METHODS: We used unilaterally nephrectomized rats with or without continuous aldosterone infusion and 0.9% saline as drinking water for 3 weeks. IMD-1041, an IKK\u03B2 inhibitor, and spironolactone were orally administered to inhibit NF\u03BAB and mineralocorticoid receptor, respectively. RESULTS: The aldosterone-infused rats exhibited severe kidney injury, hypertension, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins, osteopontin, fibrinogen, collagen type I, and PAI-1. Western blotting confirmed NF\u03BAB activation by aldosterone by the increased amount of p65 in the nuclear fraction of the kidney, and oral IMD-1041 prevented the kidney injury and lessened the increase in pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins without significant changes in blood pressures. In addition, changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been found to act as a protective factor in various kidney injury models, were examined. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the presence of ACE2 in the brush-border membrane of the proximal convoluted tubules and markedly blunted ACE2 staining in aldosterone-infused rats. The decrease in amount of ACE2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting, and IMD-1041 also prevented the decrease in ACE2. The administration of spironolactone also abolished the effects of aldosterone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that aldosterone induces kidney injury via activation of NF\u03BAB and mineralocorticoid receptor, and that decreased ACE2 expression may play an important role in aldosterone-induced kidney injury.","publish_time":"2010-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukuda, Seiichi; Horimai, Chihiro; Harada, Kaori; Wakamatsu, Toshifumi; Fukasawa, Hiroshi; Muto, Susumu; Itai, Akiko; Hayashi, Matsuhiko","journal":"Clin Exp Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0bc89887c24e30f167b98f71158750d5172054a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aldosterone-induced kidney injury","severe kidney injury","effects of aldosterone","aldosterone-infused rats","various kidney injury models","activation of NF\u03BAB","ACE2 expression","continuous aldosterone infusion","presence of ACE2","ACE2 protein","roles of NF\u03BAB activation","blunted ACE2 staining","fibrotic proteins","increased expression of pro-inflammatory","nephrectomized rats","inflammation","Western blotting","mineralocorticoid receptor","RESULTS","oral IMD","decrease","nuclear factor \u03BAB","significant changes","key roles","protective factor","nuclear fraction","various cytokines","administration of spironolactone","proximal convoluted tubules","hypertension","important role","saline","osteopontin","brush-border membrane","fibrosis","blood pressures","collagen","fibrinogen","angiotensin","p65","drinking water","weeks","Immunofluorescence studies","IKK\u03B2 inhibitor","enzyme","BACKGROUND","addition","METHODS","CONCLUSION","PAI"],"language":"en"},

Several genetic polymorphisms have now been described in KS and HSP which predispose to disease or predict disease severity. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are now known to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in ANCA-associated vasculitides, although why some individuals develop ANCA in the first instance is not yet understood. Endothelial injury and repair are active areas of research in vasculitis. It is now possible to track endothelial injury non-invasively in children with vasculitis using surrogate markers of endothelial injury. The vasculogenic pathways involved in vascular repair following vasculitis, including endothelial progenitor cells, are beginning to be studied. It is anticipated that an improved understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of vasculitis in the young will ultimately shape future novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and will help us predict which children may develop premature arteriosclerosis in later life.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brogan, Paul A.","journal":"Pediatr Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6623aadc48f91693eb36c3a99e8de81f2b01758.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","HSP","ANCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endothelial injury non-","aetiopathogenesis of vasculitis","vasculitis phenotype","surrogate markers of endothelial injury","pathogenesis of vascular injury","vascular repair","KS","children","ANCA-associated vasculitides","endothelial progenitor cells","disease severity","HSP","majority of childhood vasculitides","environmental factors","infectious triggers","inherited host responses","complex interaction","Kawasaki syndrome","active areas of research","future novel diagnostic","Henoch Sch\u0151nlein purpura","young","therapeutic approaches","premature arteriosclerosis","Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies","individuals","later life","vasculogenic pathways","Epidemiological clues","cause","improved understanding","instance","genetic polymorphisms"],"language":"en"},

Each sample was tested immunohistochemically, by sandwich ELISA and by ISH. A 2.482-kb RNA probe, matching the genomic fragment coding for the VP60 structural protein of RHDV, was arranged. Two RNA probes (sense and antisense) were transcribed in vitro and UTP-digoxigenin-labelled. The antisense probe clearly detected positivity in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes at 8 h p.i. Labelled hepatocytes were scattered throughout the sections until 24 h p.i. followed by a more diffuse perilobular positive reaction. A much weaker signal of similar distribution was detected up to 24 h p.i. using the sense RNA probe. All spleen samples tested negative for both probes. Liver samples were positive at 32 h p.i. using both ELISA and the immunoperoxidase test. Spleen samples were positive using only the ELISA at 32 h p.i. This study showed that RHDV replication occurred almost immediately after inoculation and that the liver appears to be the main site of replication.","publish_time":"1998-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gelmetti, Daniela; Grieco, Valeria; Rossi, Cesare; Capucci, Lorenzo; Lavazza, Antonio","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7975ff72b9c444c978aefed70b64ad8eb9958611.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120613.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093498000305; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093498000305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISH","RNA","RHDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Liver samples","spleen samples","h post infection","RHDV replication","sense RNA probe","antisense probe","RNA probes","BS89 RHDV strain","Labelled hepatocytes","ISH","sandwich ELISA","VP60 structural protein of RHDV","diffuse perilobular positive reaction","detected positivity","main site of replication","genomic fragment coding","technique","detection of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus","infected oro","cytoplasm","seronegative adult rabbits","study","weaker signal of similar distribution","situ hybridisation","inoculation","sections","immunoperoxidase test","UTP-digoxigenin"],"language":"en"},

Cheng et Hsiao, or C. teeta Wall (Ranunculaceae). It has been widely used to treat bacillary dysentery, diabetes, pertussis, sore throat, aphtha, and eczema in China. Objectives: The present paper reviews the latest advances of CR, focusing on the botany, phytochemistry, traditional usages, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and toxicology of CR and its future perspectives. Methods: Studies from 1985 to 2018 were reviewed from books; PhD. and MSc. dissertations; the state and local drug standards; PubMed; CNKI; Scopus; the Web of Science; and Google Scholar using the keywords Coptis, Coptidis Rhizoma, Huanglian, and goldthread. Results: Currently, 128 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from CR. Alkaloids are the characteristic components, together with organic acids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids and quinones. The extracts/compounds isolated from CR cover a wide pharmacological spectrum, including antibacterial, antivirus, antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer and cardioprotective effects. Berberine is the most important active constituent and the primary toxic component of CR. Conclusions: As an important herbal medicine in Chinese medicine, CR has the potential to treat various diseases. However, further research should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, target organs and pharmacokinetics, and to establish criteria for quality control, for CR and its related medications. In addition, the active constituents, other than alkaloids, in both raw and processed products of CR should be investigated.","publish_time":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jin; Wang, Lin; Lou, Guan-Hua; Zeng, Hai-Rong; Hu, Ju; Huang, Qin-Wan; Peng, Wei; Yang, Xiang-Bo","journal":"Pharm Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5db655de0fdc5e28e3fc13f279b5068c30e9cdc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6461078.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2019.1577466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coptidis","Berberine"],"organizations":["CR","Google Scholar","CR.

Objective To describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of recipients of HT with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This case series from a single large academic heart transplant program in New York, New York, incorporates data from between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. All recipients of HT followed up by this center who were infected with COVID-19 were included. Interventions Heart transplant and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up. Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19. Results Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years. Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%). Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation. Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL). Among patients managed at the study institution, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 16 patients (70%), and 6 (26%) had a reduction in the dose of their calcineurin inhibitor. Treatment of COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (18 patients [78%]), high-dose corticosteroids (8 patients [47%]), and interleukin 6 receptor antagonists (6 patients [26%]). Overall, 7 patients (25%) died. Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT. Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients. Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Latif, Farhana; Farr, Maryjane A; Clerkin, Kevin J; Habal, Marlena V; Takeda, Koji; Naka, Yoshifumi; Restaino, Susan; Sayer, Gabriel; Uriel, Nir","journal":"JAMA cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402056/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.2159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Treatment of COVID","group of patients","management of COVID","recipients of HT","IQR","confirmed diagnosis of COVID","outcomes of recipients","HT population","infection","median time","median peak interleukin","median age","Importance Recipients of heart transplant","study institution","included hydroxychloroquine","median high-sensitivity troponin T","Interventions Heart transplant","end of study follow-up","single-center case series","median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein","New York","high-dose corticosteroids","Main Outcomes","significant immunosuppression","Participants","years","single large academic heart transplant program","case fatality rate","patient characteristics","Secondary measures","increased risk of adverse outcomes attributable","laboratory analyses","primary measure","vital status","changes","elevated inflammatory biomarkers","coronavirus disease","evidence of myocardial injury","Setting","Relevance","multiple comorbidities","interquartile range","mycophenolate mofetil","optimal approach","Comorbid conditions","hypertension","cardiac allograft vasculopathy","data","receptor antagonists","calcineurin inhibitor","reduction","Design","Conclusions","Objective","Results","diabetes","mechanical ventilation","pg","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

A broad spectrum of replicating and non-replicating vectors is available. An appropriate choice for select applications will depend on the biology of the infectious agent targeted, as well as factors such as whether the vaccine is intended to prevent infection or boost immunity in already infected individuals, prior exposure of the target population to the vector, safety, and the number and size of gene inserts needed. Here several viral vectors under development as HIV/AIDS vaccines are reviewed. A vaccine strategy based on initial priming with a replicating vector to enlist the innate immune system, target mucosal inductive sites, and prime both cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses is proposed. Subsequently, boosting with a replicating or non-replicating vector and/or protein subunits could lead to induction of necessary levels of protective immunity.","publish_time":"2007-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robert-Guroff, Marjorie","journal":"Current Opinion in Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b61662b3c79d469f73e49be8aadf1c075203be2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dbbf18835a5e074a299f4020fbf2218f144c3e17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2245896.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0958166907001322; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166907001322; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2245896?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-replicating vectors","Viral vectors","broad spectrum of replicating","vaccine antigens","target population","target cells","vaccine strategy","mucosal immune responses","boost immunity","mucosal inductive sites","innate immune system","induction of necessary levels of protective immunity","infected individuals","prior exposure","number","development","HIV","safety","convenient means","protein subunits","initial priming","infection","AIDS vaccines","size of gene inserts","applications","biology","tissues","infectious agent","appropriate choice","factors"],"language":"en"},

Umifenovir (Arbidol\u00AE) is an antiviral drug being used to treat influenza in Russia and China. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in non-ICU Ward in Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to March 20, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into umifenovir group and control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes were the negative rate of pharyngeal swab\u2019s test for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week after admission, as well as the duration for virus turning negative. The negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if the nucleid acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for 2 consecutive tests. RESULTS: A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in umifenovir group and 36 in control group. Baseline clinical, laboratory characteristics were comparable between two groups. 33/45 (73.3%) patients in umifenovir group were tested negative in SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36 (77.8%) in control group (p=0.19). The median time from onset of symtoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative were 18 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12-21) in umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR, 11-21) in control group (p= 0.42). Patients in umifenovir group had longer hospital stay than patients in control group (13 days [IQR, 9-17] vs 11 days [IQR, 9-14], p=0.04). No deaths or severe adverse reaction were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Umifenovir might not improve the prognosis or accelerate the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in non-ICU patients.

The first experiment evaluated the effects of 3 ANC in combination with an antimicrobial in high-risk calves treated for BRD during a 56-d receiving period. Newly received crossbred steers (n = 516; initial BW = 217 \u00B1 20 kg) were monitored by trained personnel for clinical signs of BRD. Calves that met antimicrobial treatment criteria (n = 320) were then randomly assigned to experimental ANC treatment (80 steers/experimental ANC treatment): intravenous flunixin meglumine injection (NSAID), intranasal viral vaccination (VACC), intramuscular vitamin C injection (VITC), or no ANC (NOAC). Animal served as the experimental unit for all variables except DMI and G:F (pen served as the experimental unit for DMI and G:F). Within calves treated 3 times for BRD, those receiving NOAC had lower (P \u003C 0.01) clinical severity scores (severity scores ranged from 0 to 4 on the basis of observed clinical signs and severity) and heavier (P = 0.01) BW than those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC at the time of third treatment. Between the second and third BRD treatments, calves receiving NOAC had decreased (P \u003C 0.01) daily BW loss (\u22120.13 kg ADG) compared with those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC (\u22121.30, \u22121.90, and \u22121.41 kg ADG, respectively). There were no differences in rectal temperature, combined mortalities and removals, or overall performance among the experimental ANC treatments. Overall, morbidity and mortality attributed to BRD across treatments were 66.5% and 13.2%, respectively. After the receiving period, a subset of calves (n = 126) were allocated to finishing pens to evaluate the effects ANC administration on finishing performance, carcass characteristics, and lung scores at harvest. Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common physiological end point for each pen of calves. There were no differences among the experimental ANC observed during the finishing period (P \u2265 0.11). In summary, the use of NSAID, VACC, and VITC do not appear to positively impact clinical health and could potentially be detrimental to performance during the receiving period in high-risk calves receiving antimicrobial treatment for suspected BRD.","publish_time":"2015-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, B.

Recent results from such studies have generated insights into the evolution of bacterial pathogens, the levels of diversity and plasticity in the genome of a species, as well as the differences in virulence amongst pathogenic bacteria.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dorrell, Nick; Hinchliffe, Stewart J; Wren, Brendan W","journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86161746859c22d29da637d687deda287607c69d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108221.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527405001281; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369527405001281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of bacterial pathogens","virulence","studies","new insight","new methods","scale comparison of bacterial genomes","DNA microarrays","pathogenic bacteria","undetected genetic differences","DNA microarray data","population structures","levels of diversity","insights","powerful technology","development of robust comparative phylogenomics analyses","plasticity","species","Recent results","ability"],"language":"en"},

This is because most of the pathogens acquired in hospitals are able to use various different routes of infecting the patient\u0027s body so that it may be difficult or even impossible to prove an individual infection to be airborne. Only microbes such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or certain respiratory viruses that are known to be predominantly transmitted by droplet infection from infected persons or healthy carriers, have been accepted to be the cause of airborne nosocomial infections. Other pathogens such as legionellae, pseudomonads or clostridia may be distributed in the hospital environment via an insufficient or defective air-conditioning system, with or without humidification. The assessment of indirect airborne infections caused by infective particles derived from dust which has settled on furniture or the floor or which has been introduced to the hospital environment by shoes, open windows, building works or potted indoor plants is much more difficult. Many Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, mycobacteria, nocardiae, and endospores of clostridia and bacilli, as well as the reproductive elements of fungi do remain viable and infective in dry dust and may therefore infect patients when the dust is disturbed. In contrast to nosocomial infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, against which most preventive measures have been concentrated in the past and which are usually not airborne in origin, it appears that the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of hospital pathogens by air has been underestimated. When other routes of nosocomial infections are well controlled, airborne infections may gain more practical importance in hospitals.","publish_time":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schaal, K.

All this 21st-century knowledge, however, is scattered and a large part is concealed from most of the international scientific community in Mandarin-language articles. Here, we summarize the post-millennium (2000\u20132017) research on bats in China and point out trends and future directions based on neglected topics, groups, and regions. In addition, we provide an up-to-date list of bat species in China. We retrieved 594 publications related to bats in China, nearly half were written in Mandarin. At least 147 bat species are present in China, which places it among the most bat-rich countries in the world. There was a significant positive trend on the number of publications, from 12.5 annual average in 2000\u20132005 to 46.5 in recent years, reflecting the Chinese economic-scientific development in this century. We found marked taxonomic and spatial biases. Half of the studies in this century focused on Rhinolophus, Myotis, and Hipposideros, and the southern and eastern provinces were the most studied. Systematic/taxonomy and Ecology were the predominant topics post-millennium, whereas only 10 articles have clear conservation-driven goals. Our review shows that the majority of studies were focused on the least concern, cave-dweller species, and on bat-rich provinces.

CoVs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma- and deltacoronaviruses. Within the gamma-CoVs the main representative is avian coronavirus, a taxonomic name which includes the highly contagious infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) in chickens and similar viruses infecting other domestic birds such as turkeys, guinea fowls, or quails. Additionally, IBVs have been detected in healthy wild birds, demonstrating that they may act as the vector between domestic and free-living birds. Moreover, CoVs other than IBVs, are identified in wild birds, which suggests that wild birds play a key role in the epidemiology of other gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs. Development of molecular techniques has significantly improved knowledge of the prevalence of CoVs in avian species. The methods adopted in monitoring studies of CoVs in different avian species are mainly based on detection of conservative regions within the viral replicase, nucleocapsid genes, and 3\u2019UTR or 5\u2019UTR.

The shift from cell-mediated (Th1 cytokine profile) to humoral (Th2 cytokine profile) immunity during pregnancy can influence the mother\u2019s susceptibility to infection and lead to complications for both mother and fetus. The potential for vertical transmission must be considered when evaluating the risks for pregnant HCWs treating infected patients, as fetal infection can often have devastating consequences. Given the high proportion of women of childbearing age among HCWs, the pregnancy-related risks of infectious exposure are an important topic in both patient care and occupational health. Contagious patients with cutaneous manifestations often present to dermatology or pediatric clinics, where female providers are particularly prevalent, as a growing number of these physicians are female. Unfortunately, the risks of infection for pregnant HCWs are not well defined. To our knowledge, there is limited guidance on safe practices for pregnant HCWs who encounter infectious dermatologic diseases. In this article, we review several infectious exanthems, their transmissibility to pregnant women, the likelihood of vertical transmission, and the potential consequences of infection for the mother and the fetus.

Typically, IBV is titrated in embryonated chicken eggs, and the infectivity of the virus dilutions is determined by assessing clinical signs in the embryos as evidence of viral propagation. In this study, we used a dot-immunoblotting assay (DIA) to measure the titers of IBV vaccines that originated from different pathogenic strains or attenuation methods in embryonated eggs, and we compared this assay to the currently used method, clinical sign evaluation. To compare the two methods, we used real-time reverse transcription-PCR, which had the lowest limit of detection for propagated IBV. As a clinical sign of infection, dwarfism of the embryo was quantified using the embryo: egg (EE) index. The DIA showed 9.41% higher sensitivity and 15.5% higher specificity than the clinical sign determination method. The DIA was particularly useful for measuring the titer of IBV vaccine that did not cause apparent stunting but propagated in embryonated chicken eggs such as a heat-adapted vaccine strain. The results of this study indicate that the DIA is a rapid, sensitive, reliable method for determining IBV vaccine titer in embryonated eggs at a relatively low cost.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuk, Seong-su; Kwon, Jung-Hoon; Noh, Jin-Yong; Hong, Woo-tack; Gwon, Gyeong-Bin; Jeong, Jei-Hyun; Jeong, Sol; Youn, Ha-Na; Heo, Yong-Hwan; Lee, Joong-Bok; Park, Seung-Yong; Choi, In-Soo; Song, Chang-Seon","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/590f9456e9205d551114d2aa7b44cdddd8277984.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119534.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416000239; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802454/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416000239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","DIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["titer of IBV vaccine","IBV vaccine titer","embryonated eggs","propagated IBV","DIA","used method","embryonated chicken eggs","clinical sign determination method","vaccine quality","titers of IBV vaccines","clinical sign of infection","clinical sign evaluation","reliable method","specific method","clinical signs","vaccine titer of infectious bronchitis virus","heat-adapted vaccine strain","study","higher specificity","attenuation methods","higher sensitivity","virus dilutions","dot-immunoblotting assay","different pathogenic strains","embryos","commercial manufacturers","infectivity","apparent stunting","lowest limit of detection","real-time reverse transcription-PCR","dwarfism","evidence of viral propagation","EE","index","low cost","results"],"language":"en"},

This study describes the use of halofuginone lactate in preventing cryptosporidiosis in naturally infected neonatal calves on a dairy farm with a high prevalence of infection. The animals were kept in two different calf rearing systems. A randomized double-blind trial was carried out with 32 naturally infected calves, divided into four groups. The two prophylactic halofuginone lactate treated groups were kept in either individual or group pens. Similarly, the animals receiving the placebo were housed in either individual pens or together in a large pen. A total of ten faecal samples were collected periodically during the 28 days study from each calf and tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. using microscopic and molecular methods. Generalized estimating equations models were used to determine if the effects of the various treatments and/or rearing systems on the presence of diarrhoea and infection were statistically significant. Further analysis (classification trees models) was carried out to explore possible risk factors for cryptosporidiosis and interactions between treatments and rearing systems. Halofuginone lactate was shown to be effective in reducing clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis and environmental contamination. However, the treatment did not delay the onset of diarrhoea and did not reduce the risk of infection amongst calves reared together in a highly contaminated environment. The use of halofuginone lactate in combination with good hygienic measures, such as rearing animals in clean individual pens, was the most effective method to reduce the risk of cryptosporidiosis amongst 7\u201313 days old calves. It was concluded that the control of the parasite could be achieved by the combination of using effective preventive drugs, such as halofuginone lactate and good animal husbandry procedures.","publish_time":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Waele, V.; Speybroeck, N.; Berkvens, D.; Mulcahy, G.; Murphy, T.

Furthermore, experimental and natural infections in pigs have been reported with influenza A virus from avian and human sources. METHODS: This study investigated the receptor distribution in the entire respiratory tract of pigs using specific lectins Maackia Amurensis (MAA) I, and II, and Sambucus Nigra (SNA). Furthermore, the predilection sites of swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes H1N1 and H1N2 as well as avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H4N6 were investigated in the respiratory tract of experimentally infected pigs using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: SIV antigen was widely distributed in bronchi, but was also present in epithelial cells of the nose, trachea, bronchioles, and alveolar type I and II epithelial cells in severely affected animals. AIV was found in the lower respiratory tract, especially in alveolar type II epithelial cells and occasionally in bronchiolar epithelial cells. SA-alpha-2,6 was the predominant receptor in all areas of the respiratory tract with an average of 80-100% lining at the epithelial cells. On the contrary, the SA-alpha-2,3 was not present (0%) at epithelial cells of nose, trachea, and most bronchi, but was found in small amounts in bronchioles, and in alveoli reaching an average of 20-40% at the epithelial cells. Interestingly, the receptor expression of both SA-alpha-2,3 and 2,6 was markedly diminished in influenza infected areas compared to non-infected areas. CONCLUSIONS: A difference in predilection sites between SIV and AIV virus was found, and this difference was in accordance with the distribution of the SA-alpha-2,6 and SA-alpha-2,3 receptor, respectively. The results indicated that the distribution of influenza A virus receptors in pigs are similar to that of humans and therefore challenge the theory that the pig acts as a mixing vessel between human and avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, it was shown that AIV prefers to infect alveolar type II epithelial cells in pigs. This corresponds with findings in humans emphasising the resemblance between the two species.","publish_time":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trebbien, Ramona; Larsen, Lars E; Viuff, Birgitte M","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dad72f4c1b14ead806c29f48ce276b06ffeb421a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3177912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902821/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Maackia Amurensis","Sambucus Nigra"],"organizations":["AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SA-alpha","epithelial cells of nose","bronchiolar epithelial cells","distribution of influenza","AIV virus","avian influenza viruses","influenza infected areas","infected pigs","entire respiratory tract of pigs","virus infections","predilection sites of swine influenza virus","virus receptors","lower respiratory tract","upper respiratory tract","receptor distribution","sialic acid-alpha","alveolar type","predominant receptor","receptor expression","non-infected areas","trachea","SIV antigen","human sources","bronchioles","difference","humans","average","RESULTS","natural infections","immunohistochemical methods","different host origins","specific lectins Maackia Amurensis","mixing vessel","subtypes H1N1","H1N2","subtype H4N6","earlier studies","pig acts","terminal saccharides","resemblance","theory","small amounts","alveoli","CONCLUSIONS","study","accordance","affected animals","lining","Sambucus Nigra","SNA","findings","BACKGROUND","species"],"language":"en"},

The extent to which special tailoring to the addressed subjects would be helpful in improving the effectiveness of prevention measures is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review is to assess gender-specific differences in primary prevention actions. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in 2015 by searching the PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane Library databases as well as adding additional studies by cross-referencing. The search focused on studies with an analysis of gender differences in health and risk behavior concerning primary prevention. Therefore, major exclusion criteria were single-gender studies, underage (\u003C18 years) study collectives and secondary or tertiary prevention measures. RESULTS: In total, 23 studies from 13 different countries were included in the qualitative evaluation. The studies covered 11 different subtopics of primary prevention, but were too diverse in content and type to draw many fundamental conclusions. A meta-analysis was not possible. Generally a tendency for females to be more health-conscious and engaged in preventive behavior could be seen in most subgroups. CONCLUSION: The importance of gender-specific prevention measures for the healthcare system is being increasingly stressed, but only a few studies specifically analyzing the influence of gender on preventive behavior could be identified. To implement appropriate primary prevention measures tailored to gender-specific needs, more details and studies on gender differences are needed.","publish_time":"2017-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiller, Julia; Schatz, Kathrina; Drexler, Hans","journal":"Z Gesundh Wiss","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/affc6b97c5e7633d182416e3d902b1fe88d99c1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific prevention measures","single-gender studies","gender-specific differences","tertiary prevention measures","effectiveness of prevention measures","primary prevention actions","appropriate primary prevention measures","importance of gender","influence of gender","analysis of gender differences","additional studies","different subtopics of primary prevention","gender-specific needs","risk behavior","preventive behavior","health-conscious","systematic review","different countries","meta-analysis","healthcare systems","study collectives","details","years","underage","Cochrane Library databases","major exclusion criteria","type","special tailoring","addressed subjects","Medline","content","PubMed","females","METHODS","total","population","fundamental conclusions","qualitative evaluation","extent","tendency","goal","RESULTS","cross-referencing","AIM","search","subgroups"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that children with chronic suppurative lung disease have a reduced capacity to produce IFN-\u03B3 in response to NTHi compared with healthy control children. The aim of this study was to determine if deficient NTHi-specific IFN-\u03B3 production is associated with heightened systemic or airway inflammation. We measured a panel of cytokines (IFN-\u03B3, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p70), antimicrobial proteins (LL-37, IP-10) as well as cellular and clinical factors associated with airway and systemic inflammation in 70 children with chronic suppurative lung disease. IFN-\u03B3 was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells challenged in vitro with live NTHi. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between the systemic and airway inflammation and the capacity to produce IFN-\u03B3. On multivariate regression, NTHi-specific IFN-\u03B3 production was significantly negatively associated with the BAL concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (\u03B2=-0.316; 95%CI -0.49, -0.14; p=0.001) and IL-1\u03B2 (\u03B2=-0.023; 95%CI -0.04, -0.01; p=0.001). This association was independent of bacterial or viral infection, BAL cellularity and the severity of bronchiectasis (using modified Bhalla score on chest CT scans). We found limited evidence of systemic inflammation in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. In summary, increased local airway inflammation is associated with a poorer systemic cell-mediated immune response to NTHi in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. These data support the emerging body of evidence that impaired cell-mediated immune responses and dysregulated airway inflammation may be linked and contribute to the pathobiology of chronic suppurative lung disease.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pizzutto, Susan J.; Upham, John W.; Yerkovich, Stephanie T.; Chang, Anne B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/737e13b0236c1e2a6ada9c31ad3d8987a559b244.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4466570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26066058/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129517","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathobiology of chronic suppurative lung disease","dysregulated airway inflammation","local airway inflammation","deficient NTHi-specific IFN-\u03B3 production","live NTHi","limited evidence of systemic inflammation","inflammatory cytokines IL","poorer systemic cell","healthy control children","association","immune responses","impaired cell","reduced capacity","BAL cellularity","BAL concentrations","panel of cytokines","multivariate regression","Regression analysis","emerging body of evidence","modified Bhalla score","severity of bronchiectasis","viral infection","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","chest CT scans","independent of bacterial","clinical factors","antimicrobial proteins","p70","Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae","data","study","summary","aim"],"language":"en"},

ISSR analysis revealed low genetic variations within populations but high genetic differentiations among populations. This genetic structure probably mainly reflects the historical association among populations. Genetic cluster analysis showed that the basal clade is composed of populations from Southwest China, and the other populations have continuous and eastward distributions.

This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the na\u00EFve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3\u20135 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum. Our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines, whereby PEDV intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-MG-sIgA axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langel, Stephanie N.; Paim, Francine C.; Alhamo, Moyasar A.; Buckley, Alexandra; Van Geelen, Albert; Lager, Kelly M.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/360ab35f1a888c57572270161254de77913951be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6491507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068924/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV IgA","PEDV Ab"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV virus","PEDV antibodies","PEDV IgA Abs","PEDV infection of gilts","PEDV intestinal infection","Abs post PEDV infection","high virulence of PEDV","anti-PEDV immune response","higher PEDV Ab responses","PEDV antibody secreting cells","non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts","higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA","trimester gilts","lactogenic immune protection","gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines","VN Abs","IgG Abs","maternal immune responses","neonatal piglets","piglet protection","groups of gilts","immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets","passive lactogenic immunity","maternal immune response changes","optimal passive lactogenic protection","ASCs","generation of lactogenic immunity","subsequent protection","pregnancy","sIgA axis","suckling neonates","secretory IgA","stage of gestation","course of gestation","piglet survival","multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum","different stages of gestation","implications","piglet serum","gut-mammary gland","B cells","gestational window","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","acute diarrhea","survival rate","mock litters","cytokines","milk","maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking","enteric viral infections","alphacoronavirus","example","findings","Control","days postpartum"],"language":"en"},

Lockdown has been recognized as an effective measure to minimise the risk of infection. The effect of this extreme and prolonged situation on glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unknown. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) allow health care professionals to remotely monitored sensor glucose levels. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of lockdown on glycaemic control in adults with T1D. METHODS People with T1D on multiple daily insulin injections and using CGM or FGM were included. Sensor data from the 2 weeks before the start of the COVID-19 lockdown and from the 2 weeks after 5 weeks of consecutive lockdown were compared. RESULTS 147 subjects were selected (age: 39\u00B114 years (15-80), 54% male (n=80), diabetes duration: 18\u00B111 years). Forty six percent (n=68) were CGM users and 54% (n=79) FGM users.

In the present study, we investigate the epidemiologic and viral molecular features of HAdVs circulating in Senegal after 4 consecutive years of sentinel surveillance of influenza-like Illness cases. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Adenoviral detection is performed by rRT-PCR with the Anyplex(\u2122) II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) and molecular characterization was performed using a partial hexon gene sequence. 6381 samples were collected. More than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of \u2264 5 years. 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV with 1561 (79.4%) found in co-infection with at least one another respiratory virus. The most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Children under 5 were the most infected group (62.2%; 1224/1967; p \u003C0.05). We noted that HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitudes without any clear seasonality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed species HAdV-C in majority, species HAdV-B and one HAdV- 4 genome type. The 9 HAdV-B species like strains from Senegal grouped with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 as shown by a phylogenetic branch with a high bootstrap value of (88%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest strong year-round HAdV activity in Senegal, especially in children up to 5 years of age. Molecular studies revealed that the dominant species in circulation in patients with ILI appears to be HAdV-C and HAdV-B species. The circulation of though HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niang, Mbayame Ndiaye; Diop, Ndeye Sokhna; Fall, Amary; Kiori, Davy E.; Sarr, Fatoumata Diene; Sy, Sara; Goudiaby, D\u00E9borah; Barry, Mamadou Aliou; Fall, Malick; Dia, Ndongo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8207b55dbdf90c353bda7975f849d94bd704653.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5362214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328944/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","RSV"],"locations":["Senegal"],"keyphrases":["HAdV-B species","species HAdV-B","species HAdV-C","genome types HAdV","strong year-round HAdV activity","Senegal","dominant species","children","molecular characterization","present study","Adenoviral detection","Molecular studies","respiratory tract","respiratory virus","RESULTS","years of age","CONCLUSION","circulation","viral molecular features of HAdVs","RV16 Detection kit","consecutive years of sentinel surveillance of influenza","detection peaks of different amplitudes","high level","influenza viruses","Human adenoviruses","phylogenetic branch","fatal acute respiratory infections","Phylogenetic analysis","half of patients","high bootstrap value","consenting ILI outpatients","common co-detections","wide spectrum of human illnesses","strains","majority","serotypes","note","Seegene","recognized causes","Anyplex","partial hexon gene sequence","clear seasonality","Illness cases","rRT-PCR","swabs","contagious pathogens","BACKGROUND","infected group","METHODOLOGY","samples","rhinoviruses","enteroviruses","RSV"],"language":"en"},

Pseudotyped viruses are useful for measuring neutralization titers against highly infectious viruses as well as for studying their mechanism of entry. In this study, we constructed a series of cytoplasmic deletion mutants of MERS-CoV S and compared the efficiency with which they formed pseudotypes with vesicular stomatitis virus. A pseudotype bearing an S protein with the C-terminal 16 amino acids deleted (MERSpv-St16) reached a maximum titer that was approximately tenfold higher than that of a pseudotype bearing a non-truncated full-length S protein. Using MERSpv-St16, we demonstrated the inability of rat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, suggesting that rats are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. This study provides novel information that enhances our understanding of the host range of MERS-CoV.

Information regarding the participants\u0027 age, gender, country of origin, medical conditions, and vaccination history were obtained. Results. The mean age of the screened population was 51.8 years (range, 18\u201393 years) with a male/female ratio of 1.17:1. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples tested (3210 pre-Hajj and 2025 post-Hajj screening). According to the vaccination documents, all participants had received meningococcal vaccination and the majority of those from at-risk countries were vaccinated against yellow fever and polio.

The present study was carried out to examine alterations in oxidative stress indices in the erythrocytes from dogs suffering from gastroenteritis with or without canine parvoviral infection as confirmed by CPV-DNA amplification from faeces using specific primers for CPV-2 as well as CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The present investigation utilized clinical cases of dogs with signs of acute diarrhea (n =56), and 14 more apparently healthy dogs of similar age group. Erythrocytic oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxides level and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and blood micro-mineral (iron, copper, cobalt and zinc) status were analyzed in each dog (n =70). The acute cases of gastroenteritis in dogs were associated with altered erythrocytic lipid peroxidation as evident by estimation of malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, the first line of antioxidant defense against damaging effects of free radicals, were also altered. The alterations in oxidative stress indices were more pronounced in cases with involvement of canine parvovirus as compared to parvo-negative cases.

Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PLpro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with ubiquitin, facilitating the design of PLpro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels for interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate immune-suppressive DUB activity of PLpros is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the context of rational vaccine development. Although zoonotic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have pandemic potential, therapeutics and vaccines that counteract this public health threat are not currently available. Coronaviruses typically employ multiple strategies to evade the host\u2019s innate immune response, which may enhance clinical disease and/or reduce the efficacy of modified live vaccines. The MERS-CoV-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) is not only crucial for the expression of functional replicase proteins, but has also been postulated to antagonize ubiquitination-dependent steps during the activation of the innate immune response. Here, we report the generation of engineered MERS-CoVs mutants in which PLpro\u2019s deubiquitinating (DUB) activity was specifically disrupted without affecting virus viability. In this manner, we could demonstrate that the DUB activity of PLpro suppresses the interferon response in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Strikingly, in the lungs of mice infected with DUB-negative MERS-CoV, innate immune responses were induced at an earlier stage of infection than in wt virus-infected mice.

In response to viral infections, host innate responses provide the first line of defense against viruses, which often act even before the establishment of the infection. Host cells sense the presence of viral components through germinal encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory and interferon productions. Induced antiviral responses play a critical role in the outcome of the infections. In order to improve current strategies for control of viral infections or to advance new strategies aimed against viral infections, a deep understanding of host-virus interaction and induction of antiviral responses is required. In this review, we summarized recent progress in understanding innate antiviral responses in chickens with a focus on the avian influenza virus and infectious bronchitis virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barjesteh, Neda; O\u0027Dowd, Kelsey; Vahedi, Seyed Milad","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55b475087049aab4db5dba6bcff6423d3f7340a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129915.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31901597/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466619303904; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466619303904; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154961","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of viral infections","respiratory viral infections","host innate responses","induction of antiviral responses","innate antiviral responses","presence of viral components","virus interaction","chickens","Host cells","deep understanding of host","avian influenza virus","infectious bronchitis virus","current strategies","new strategies","engagement of PRRs","induction of pro-inflammatory","germinal encoded pattern recognition receptors","significant threat","focus","poultry industry","recent progress","molecular patterns","critical role","pathogen","interferon productions","line of defense","public health","order","outcome","Abstract","viruses","review","establishment"],"language":"en"},

This study examined how CD4 T cells affect primary and secondary anti-viral CD8 T-cell responses within the central nervous system (CNS) during encephalomyelitis induced by sublethal gliatropic coronavirus. CD4 T-cell depletion before infection did not impair peripheral expansion, interferon-\u03B3 production, CNS recruitment or initial CNS effector capacity of virus-specific CD8 T cells ex vivo. Nevertheless, impaired virus control in the absence of CD4 T cells was associated with gradually diminished CNS CD8 T-cell interferon-\u03B3 production. Furthermore, within the CD8 T-cell population short-lived effector cells were increased and memory precursor effector cells were significantly decreased, consistent with higher T-cell turnover. Transfer of memory CD8 T cells to reduce viral load in CD4-depleted mice reverted the recipient CNS CD8 T-cell phenotype to that in wild-type control mice. However, memory CD8 T cells primed without CD4 T cells and transferred into infected CD4-sufficient recipients expanded less efficiently and were not sustained in the CNS, contrasting with their helped counterparts. These data suggest that CD4 T cells are dispensable for initial expansion, CNS recruitment and differentiation of primary resident memory CD8 T cells as long as the duration of antigen exposure is limited. By contrast, CD4 T cells are essential to prolong primary CD8 T-cell function in the CNS and imprint memory CD8 T cells for recall responses.","publish_time":"2015-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Mihyun; Phares, Timothy W; Hinton, David R; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Min, Booki","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c388db3e01b02560b714c3f8da9f807ab6173a15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4557674.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187405/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of CD4 T cells","imprint memory CD8 T cells","Transfer of memory CD8 T cells","effective primary CD8 T cells","specific CD8 T cells ex","CD4 T-cell depletion","CD4 T-cell help","primary CD8 T-cell function","CD8 T-cell population short-lived effector cells","recipient CNS CD8 T-cell phenotype","differentiation of primary resident memory CD8 T cells","memory CD8 T cells capable of recall responses","higher T-cell turnover","diminished CNS CD8 T-cell interferon-\u03B3 production","secondary anti-viral CD8 T-cell responses","memory precursor effector cells","CNS recruitment","CD4-depleted mice","initial CNS effector capacity of virus","infected CD4-sufficient recipients","initial expansion","impaired virus control","viral load","peripheral expansion","wild-type control mice","universal requirement","encephalomyelitis","central nervous system","infection","contrast","sublethal gliatropic coronavirus","study","data","duration of antigen exposure","helped counterparts"],"language":"en"},

The intention behind triage is to improve the emergency care and to prioritize cases in terms of clinical urgency. DISCUSSION: In emergency department triage, medical care might lead to adverse consequences like delay in providing care, compromise in privacy and confidentiality, poor physician-patient communication, failing to provide the necessary care altogether, or even having to decide whose life to save when not everyone can be saved. These consequences challenge the ethical quality of emergency care. This article provides an ethical analysis of \u0022routine\u0022 emergency department triage. The four principles of biomedical ethics - viz. respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice provide the starting point and help us to identify the ethical challenges of emergency department triage. However, they do not offer a comprehensive ethical view. To address the ethical issues of emergency department triage from a more comprehensive ethical view, the care ethics perspective offers additional insights. SUMMARY: We integrate the results from the analysis using four principles of biomedical ethics into care ethics perspective on triage and propose an integrated clinically and ethically based framework of emergency department triage planning, as seen from a comprehensive ethics perspective that incorporates both the principles-based and care-oriented approach.","publish_time":"2011-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aacharya, Ramesh P; Gastmans, Chris; Denier, Yvonne","journal":"BMC Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34190b8df3ed825e3c49e41a3782d04acf1e21e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3199257.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-227x-11-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ethical quality of emergency care","ethical challenges of emergency department triage","ethical issues of emergency department triage","care ethics perspective","medical care","triage system","necessary care","Emergency departments","based framework of emergency department triage planning","ethical analysis","comprehensive ethics perspective","comprehensive ethical view","principles of biomedical ethics","care-oriented approach","adverse consequences","confidentiality","nonmaleficence","autonomy","respect","globe","justice","poor physician-patient communication","compromise","privacy","cases","routine","beneficence","order","delay","additional insights","terms of clinical urgency","starting point","results","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","overcrowding","article","SUMMARY","intention","life"],"language":"en"},

Each year during the winter period, from November to March, 2,415 nasal swabs were tested by a direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) for influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were detected by RT\u2010PCR. A RT\u2010PCR designed for the M gene was performed on negative samples for hMPV detection and phylogenic analyses. For the three consecutive winters, hMPV represented 10%, 22.6%, and 8.8% of virus\u2010negative samples, respectively.

The biogenesis and three-dimensional organization of these membranes and the link between replication and virus assembly sites is not fully clear. Using electron microscopy, we find Dengue virus (DENV)-induced vesicles, convoluted membranes, and virus particles to be endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived, and we detect double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, inside virus-induced vesicles. Electron tomography (ET) shows DENV-induced membrane structures to be part of one ER-derived network. Furthermore, ET reveals vesicle pores that could enable release of newly synthesized viral RNA and reveals budding of DENV particles on ER membranes directly apposed to vesicle pores. Thus, DENV modifies ER membrane structure to promote replication and efficient encapsidation of the genome into progeny virus. This architecture of DENV replication and assembly sites could explain the coordination of distinct steps of the flavivirus replication cycle.","publish_time":"2009-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welsch, Sonja; Miller, Sven; Romero-Brey, Ines; Merz, Andreas; Bleck, Christopher K.E.; Walther, Paul; Fuller, Stephen D.; Antony, Claude; Krijnse-Locker, Jacomine; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1447e2a541043dd3ab8edd75b671b178f4eed860.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8f706b5ee6fb8d199def52178e332826e457c190.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103389.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312809000985; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312809000985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19380115/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2009.03.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ET","DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["architecture of DENV replication","ER membranes","virus particles","DENV particles","virus-induced vesicles","viral genome replication","presumed marker of RNA replication","virus assembly sites","Dengue virus","progeny virus","DENV-induced membrane structures","flavivirus replication cycle","cellular membranes","convoluted membranes","synthesized viral RNA","ER membrane structure","ER-derived network","double-stranded RNA","vesicle pores","Positive-strand RNA viruses","electron microscopy","Electron tomography","efficient encapsidation","link","coordination of distinct steps","release","endoplasmic reticulum","three-dimensional organization","biogenesis"],"language":"en"},

This phenotype is induced by viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in KSHV, muSOX in MHV68, BGLF5 in EBV and vhs in HSV-1. Here, we performed comparative RNA-seq upon expression of these herpesviral endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with previous reports, we found that approximately two thirds of transcripts are downregulated in cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among transcripts spared from degradation, we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escape degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that like the previously identified escapees, this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3\u2019UTR. We then show that C19ORF66, a known anti-viral protein, is a potent KSHV restriction factor, suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator.","publish_time":"2018-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez, William; Srivastav, Aman; Muller, Mandy","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c9f7e68f526e733f706bdee1c9861c5fc71aa6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/52a8089242fbe484e537cd8ea5c0c9ec3bf32150.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/506410","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX","KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral-host interplay","viral cleavage","viral endoribonucleases","viral infection","degradation","host response","host resources","host transcriptome","known anti-viral protein","order","ability","herpesviral endonucleases","tested endonucleases","C19ORF66","cluster of transcripts","thirds of transcripts","identified escapees","comparative RNA-seq","novel KSHV regulator","potent KSHV restriction factor","comparative approach","widespread RNA decay","BGLF5","MHV68","expression","key regulators","important component","EBV","powerful tool","muSOX","access","vhs","striking characteristic of certain herpesviruses","effect","cells","HSV","previous reports","phenotype","UTR"],"language":"en"},

This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion.

Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the molecular epidemiology, demographic and clinical characteristics of HRVs among hospitalized children with ALRIs. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and sixty-five nasopharangeal aspirates taken from children \u003C5 years hospitalized with ALRTIs in Serdang Hospital, Malaysia, were subject to reverse transcriptase-PCR for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis on VP4/VP2 and 5\u2032-NCR regions was used to further characterize HRV. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated using semi-nested multiplex RT-PCR assay. Clinical parameters were analyzed between HRV, RSV and IFV-A mono-infections and between HRV species. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 54 (33%) patients for both single (36 samples) and multiple (18 samples) infections, 61.1% (22/36) represents HRV-A strains while the remaining 14 HRV-C. Strain P51was the first reported representative of HRV98. The majority of the single HRV cases were in the second half of infancy; HRV-C occurred among older children compared with HRV-A. HRV children were admitted significantly earlier and less febrile than RSV and IFV-A infection. HRV-C infected children were more likely to have rhonchi and vomiting as compared to HRV-A. Pneumonia was the most common discharge diagnosis followed by bronchiolitis and post-viral wheeze in HRV patients. CONCLUSION: Our study showed high prevalence of HRVs and detection of HRV-C among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia.

Previous studies show that single mAbs in immune prophylaxis can be protective against H5N1 infection. But a single mAb may not be effective in neutralization of a broad range of different strains of H5N1 and control of potential neutralization escape mutants. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected two mAbs which recognized different epitopes on the hemagglutinin molecule. These two mAbs could each neutralize in vitro escape mutants to the other and in combination could effectively neutralize viruses from clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8 of influenza A H5N1 viruses. This combination of chimeric mAbs when administered passively, pre or post challenge with 10 MLD50 (50% mouse lethal dose) HPAI H5N1 influenza A viruses could protect 100% of the mice from two different clades of viruses (clades 1 and 2.1). We also tested the efficacy of a single dose of the combination of mAbs versus two doses. Two doses of the combination therapy not only affected early clearance of the virus from the lung but could completely prevent lung pathology of the H5N1 infected mice. No escape variants were detected after therapy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies provide proof of concept that the synergistic action of two or more mAbs in combination is required for preventing the generation of escape mutants and also to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of passive therapy against H5N1 infection. Combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of antibody to be administered for passive therapy of influenza infection and hence can be made available at reduced economic costs during an outbreak.","publish_time":"2009-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prabakaran, Mookkan; Prabhu, Nayana; He, Fang; Hongliang, Qian; Ho, Hui-Ting; Qiang, Jia; TaoMeng,; Goutama, Michael; Kwang, Jimmy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/920282c7a0656a43143be9b656b36367cf871c08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2682562.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19478856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combination of mAbs","combination therapy","H5N1 infection","recent H5N1 viruses","single mAbs","combination of chimeric mAbs","HPAI H5N1 influenza","effective therapy","H5N1 infected mice","different clades of viruses","passive therapy of influenza infection","human H5N1 pandemic","single dose","broad range of different strains of H5N1","therapeutic efficacy of passive therapy","generation of escape mutants","escape variants","control of potential neutralization escape mutants","different epitopes","doses","mouse lethal dose","lower dose of antibody","lung pathology","Previous studies","anti-viral drugs","MLD50","newer strategies","fact","immune prophylaxis","proof of concept","early clearance","reduced economic costs","synergistic action","outbreak","post challenge","SIGNIFICANCE","hemagglutinin molecule","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","possibility","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Although the limitation of the assumptions in a well-mixed model is well known, there has been very little research reported in the published literature on the discrepancy of exposure assessments between numerical models which take account of gravitational effects and the well-mixed model. A new Eulerian-type drift-flux model has been developed to simulate particle dispersion and personal exposure in a two-zone geometry, which accounts for the drift velocity resulting from gravitational settling and diffusion. To validate the numerical model, a small-scale chamber was fabricated. The airflow characteristics and particle concentrations were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer. Both simulated airflow and concentration profiles agree well with the experimental results. A strong inhomogeneous concentration was observed experimentally for 10\u03BCm aerosols. The computational model was further applied to study a simple hypothetical, yet more realistic scenario. The aim was to explore different levels of exposure predicted by the new model and the well-mixed model. Aerosols are initially uniformly distributed in one zone and subsequently transported and dispersed to an adjacent zone through an opening. Owing to the significant difference in the rates of transport and dispersion between aerosols and gases, inferred from the results, the well-mixed model tends to overpredict the concentration in the source zone, and under-predict the concentration in the exposed zone. The results are very useful to illustrate that the well-mixed assumption must be applied cautiously for exposure assessments as such an ideal condition may not be applied for coarse particles.","publish_time":"2008-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Alvin C.K.; Wang, K.; Chen, F.

Enteroviruses have been associated with regional and global epidemics, recently, including with severe disease (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here, we typed Enterovirus A-D (EV) from central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory infections in Viet Nam. METHODS: Data and specimens from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined using type-specific RT-PCR and viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4) sequencing. RESULTS: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children \u2013 10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal swabs) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory infection (124 children \u2013 124 respiratory swabs) were analysed. Twenty-six different serotypes of the four Enterovirus species (A-D) were identified, including EV-A71 and EV-D68. Enterovirus B was associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Hand, foot and mouth disease associated Enteroviruses A (EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus [CV] A10) were detected in children with encephalitis. Diverse serotypes of all four Enterovirus species were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polio-vaccine viruses, but also 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses in respiratory infection remains unknown. CONCLUSION: We describe the diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with CNS and respiratory infections in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010.

When the virus is lymphotropic, understanding the pathogenic process of the viral disease becomes complicated because virus/lymphocyte interactions can alter the cell\u0027s integrity and subsequently induce immunodeficiency. The immune system plays an important role in the outcome of acute disease induced by the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). The use of attenuated escape mutants provides a tool to study the role of viral properties involved in its pathogenicity. We selected MHV3 mutants by virtue of their resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in order to study their pathogenic properties. We reported that two MHV3 escape mutants were attenuated in their pathogenic properties according to inoculation site and with regard to survival time and ability to deplete T- and B-cell subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow of susceptible Balb/c mice. The highly attenuated CL12 mutant could not induce depletion in T or B cells following intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intranasal (i.n.) inoculations, at three days postinfection. The less attenuated 51.6 mutant, however, maintained the ability to deplete T and B cells following i.p. inoculation, as described with the pathogenic MHV3. In contrast, no depletion of T cells following i.n. inoculation was induced with this mutant, although B lineage cells decreased. The use of such mutants enabled us to examine the role of each compartment of the immune system, since the highly attenuated CL12 mutant induced no immunodeficiency, as defined by immune cell depletion, whereas the less attenuated 51.6 mutant maintained its ability to decrease only the B-cell compartment after i.n. inoculation. Results are discussed with regard to the virus/lymphocyte interactions during the pathogenic process.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamontagne, L.; Pag\u00E9, C.; Braunwald, J.; Martin, J.-P.","journal":"Research in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e67fdbe304e03e77a4c665ba5a8846391d014832.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923249494800731; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923249494800731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cells","pathogenic MHV3","attenuated CL12 mutant","pathogenic properties","MHV3 mutants","depletion of T cells","pathogenic process","use of attenuated escape mutants","role of viral properties","immune cell depletion","B-cell compartment","B lineage cells","MHV3 escape mutants","viral disease","B-cell subpopulations","ability","immune system","viral replication","inoculation site","Summary Viral pathogenicity","lymphocyte interactions","regard","important role","host\u0027s immune defences","immunodeficiency","mouse hepatitis virus type","outcome of acute disease","thymus","bone marrow of susceptible Balb","resistance","spleen","survival time","neutralization","imbalance","tool","monoclonal antibodies","c mice","mAb","cell\u0027s integrity","order","virtue","inoculations","lymphotropic","contrast","days postinfection","Results"],"language":"en"},

The elucidation of the events associated with the intestinal epithelial response to PEDV infection has been limited by the absence of good in vitro porcine intestinal models that recapitulate the multicellular complexity of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we generated swine enteroids from the intestinal crypt stem cells of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum and found that the generated enteroids are able to satisfactorily recapitulate the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo and are susceptible to infection by PEDV. PEDV infected multiple types of cells, including enterocytes, stem cells, and goblet cells, and exhibited segmental infection discrepancies compared with ileal enteroids and colonoids, and this finding was verified in vivo. Moreover, the clinical isolate PEDV-JMS propagated better in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted isolate PEDV-CV777, and PEDV infection suppressed interferon (IFN) production early during the infection course. IFN lambda elicited a potent antiviral response and inhibited PEDV in enteroids more efficiently than IFN alpha (IFN-\u03B1). Therefore, swine enteroids provide a novel in vitro model for exploring the pathogenesis of PEDV and for the in vitro study of the interplay between a host and a variety of swine enteric viruses. IMPORTANCE PEDV is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that causes significant economic losses, and the lack of a good in vitro model system is a major roadblock to an in-depth understanding of PEDV pathogenesis. Here, we generated a porcine intestinal enteroid model for PEDV infection. Utilizing porcine intestinal enteroids, we demonstrated that PEDV infects multiple lineages of the intestinal epithelium and preferably infects ileal enteroids over colonoids and that enteroids prefer to respond to IFN lambda 1 over IFN-\u03B1. These events recapitulate the events that occur in vivo. This study constitutes the first use of a primary intestinal enteroid model to investigate the susceptibility of porcine enteroids to PEDV and to determine the antiviral response following infection. Our study provides important insights into the events associated with PEDV infection of the porcine intestine and provides a valuable in vitro model for studying not only PEDV but also other swine enteric viruses.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Liang; Fu, Fang; Guo, Shanshan; Wang, Hongfeng; He, Xijun; Xue, Mei; Yin, Lingdan; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70b921f57726a3fbc84e56de366e917d4b8c8ca3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6384061.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01682-18; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/5/e01682-18.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30541861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","pathogenesis of PEDV","inhibited PEDV","IMPORTANCE PEDV","porcine intestinal enteroids","swine enteroids","ileal enteroids","generated enteroids","isolate PEDV-CV777","susceptibility of porcine enteroids","porcine intestinal enteroid model","porcine intestinal models","in-depth understanding of PEDV pathogenesis","clinical isolate PEDV-JMS","PEDV infected multiple types of cells","infection course","intestinal epithelial response","primary intestinal enteroid model","IFN lambda","IFN-\u03B1","events","intestinal crypt stem cells","complicated intestinal epithelium","porcine intestine","IFN alpha","segmental infection discrepancies","model system","study","variety of swine enteric viruses","goblet cells","contagious gastrointestinal swine disease","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","contagious enteric coronavirus","potent antiviral response","colonoids","absence of good","multiple lineages","gastrointestinal tract","lack","major roadblock","duodenum","enterocytes","significant economic losses","multicellular complexity","host","production","interferon","jejunum","member","ileum","important insights","group of alphacoronaviruses","interplay","finding","elucidation"],"language":"en"},

Microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant\u2019s head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes ZIKV. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using the High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (toll-like receptor signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways (neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal system development) that are associated with these interactors. Our novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of ZIKV for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.; Karunakaran, Kalyani B.; Correa-Men\u00E9ndez, Josefina","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5747333.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29333229/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.9364.2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["dendritic cells","ependymal cells","known protein-protein interactions","neural tube closure","natural killer cells","T-helper cells","High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction","neuronal pathways","developmental pathways","immunity pathways","IFITM3","potential targets of ZIKV","reported cases of microcephaly","novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction","host invasion","host defense","interacting proteins","interactome of IFITM1","reported case of Zika virus","brain development","exact mechanisms","small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins","embryonic skeletal system development","crosstalk","axonal guidance","actin cytoskeleton","infant\u2019s head","complications","receptor","cd28","immunosuppression","HiPPIP","direct future research","pathway associations","cytoskeletal rearrangements","neurological condition","toll","significant increase","inhibition","model","Brazil","light","available databases","results","flaviviridae family","flaviviruses","members","interactors"],"language":"en"},

Various strategies, including pharmaceutical interventions (such as vaccines and antivirals) and nonpharmaceutical interventions (such as quarantine, isolation, and social distancing) may be implemented to mitigate the impact of a pandemic. It is necessary to understand the potential benefits and limitations of each strategy to determine the most appropriate strategies to be implemented. In this article, each strategy is reviewed to define its potential benefits and limitations during a pandemic. Vaccines are probably the most effective measure to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, vaccines are not likely to be available at an early stage of a pandemic. The supply of vaccines is most likely to be insufficient due to limited worldwide production capacity. Antivirals, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors, are expected to be effective against a pandemic influenza strain and are the only available pharmaceutical intervention until enough vaccines are produced. Shortage of supply and high cost is still a major limiting factor in amassing large stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors. The possible emergence of resistant strains should also be considered. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective in preventing the spread of the virus under certain conditions. The effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends on how influenza viruses are transmitted. There are still significant gaps in the scientific evidence of the way in which influenza viruses are transmitted. Further studies should be conducted to define the basic transmission patterns of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oshitani, Hitoshi","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11491616b570c8451ba208af89eb9632312876d5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c7fadcbec0268eb1468e4eaac3ba243f10cda4d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X06709199; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X06709199","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza strain","impending influenza pandemic","supply of vaccines","effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions","basic transmission patterns of influenza viruses","recent avian influenza outbreaks","effective measure","potential benefits","strategy","limitations","antivirals","available pharmaceutical intervention","Shortage of supply","Various strategies","appropriate strategies","amassing large stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors","major limiting factor","high cost","importance","quarantine","scientific evidence","limited worldwide production capacity","spread","isolation","way","preparedness","early stage","possible emergence of resistant strains","certain conditions","significant gaps","social distancing","morbidity","mortality","article","impact","studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we describe and update the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IPS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 (n = 1829). IPS was defined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute consensus definition: multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging, absence of lower respiratory tract infection, and hypoxemia. We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT. We examined conditioning intensity (nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative with high-dose total body irradiation [TBI] versus myeloablative with low-dose TBI) as an IPS risk factor in a time-to-event analysis using Cox models, controlled for age at transplant, HLA matching, stem cell source, and pretransplant Lung function Score (a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)). Among 1829 HCT recipients, 67 fulfilled IPS criteria within 120 days (3.7%). Individuals who developed IPS were more likely to be black/non-Hispanic versus other racial groups and have severe pulmonary impairment but were otherwise similar to participants without IPS. In adjusted models, myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI was associated with increased risk of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.2). Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wenger, David S.; Triplette, Matthew; Crothers, Kristina; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Hill, Joshua A.; Milano, Filippo; Shahrir, Shahida; Schoch, Gary; Vande Vusse, Lisa K.","journal":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/109cceb7306b8e73e47f9778cf154a5d1833e6e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7035790.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605819/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879119306548; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.09.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879119306548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPS","Blood Institute","HLA","TBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPS incidence","incidence of IPS","days of HCT","diagnosis of IPS","outcomes of IPS","increased risk of IPS","IPS risk factor","pathologic mediators of IPS","fulfilled IPS criteria","allogeneic HCT","HCT recipients","lung injury post-HCT","patients","high-dose TBI","myeloablative conditioning","low-dose TBI","risk factors","post-transplant mortality","Future study","retrospective cohort study","high-dose total body irradiation","pretransplant Lung function Score","Cox models","adjusted models","conditioning intensity","stem cell source","hematopoietic cell transplantation","combined measure of impairment","severe pulmonary impairment","multilobar airspace opacities","chest imaging","Blood Institute consensus definition","absence of lower respiratory tract infection","racial groups","HLA matching","advances","Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","early detection","current knowledge of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","improved specificity","Diffusion capacity","age","adults","time","nonmyeloablative","carbon monoxide","targeted therapies","hazard ratio","National Heart","DLCO","FEV1","hypoxemia","event analysis","Expiratory Volume","critical care practices","participants","Individuals","confidence interval","contrast","findings"],"language":"en"},

In many cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses swiftly relocate and repurpose translation machinery, resulting in global inhibition of translation and the aggregation of stalled 48S mRNPs into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules. This results in translational silencing of all mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the specific stress. For example, expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling pathways whilst at the same time IBV replication also results in induction of seemingly canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular translation and antiviral stress signaling.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brownsword, Matthew J.; Doyle, Nicole; Brocard, Mich\u00E8le; Locker, Nicolas; Maier, Helena J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2be547086c6bab89b47c2dfc9072c9600d9037c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c14d50924f959d38ff7857e6db3a60c929448956.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/819482","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral stress","cellular stress responses","specific stress","stress granule formation","stress granule regulation","multiple cellular stress granule","canonical stress granules","IBV infection","cellular translation machinery","results","time IBV replication","global inhibition of translation","viral infection","Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","translational repression","translational silencing","expression of antiviral factors","express viral genes","S mRNPs","aggregation of stalled","cytoplasmic foci","processes","induction","pathways","mRNAs","novel insights","important poultry disease","proportion of infected cells","independent of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","example","Viruses","cases"],"language":"en"},

During the next 100 years similar laws were introduced in Italian and in French ports, and they gradually acquired other connotations with respect to their original implementation. Measures analogous to those employed against the plague have been adopted to fight against the disease termed the Great White Plague, i.e. tuberculosis, and in recent times various countries have set up official entities for the identification and control of infections. Even more recently (2003) the proposal of the constitution of a new European monitoring, regulatory and research institution has been made, since the already available system of surveillance has found an enormous challenge in the global emergency of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the absence of a targeted vaccine, general preventive interventions have to be relied upon, including high healthcare surveillance and public information.

Here we review how host- and virus-directed ubiquitin modification of proteins in the RLR, NLR, and TLR antiviral signaling cascades modulate IFN-I expression.","publish_time":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heaton, Steven M.; Borg, Natalie A.; Dixit, Vishva M.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd4ce30ff12f64b4cc7327406db2d77e5a9a66b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4710203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712804/; https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20151531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-","receptor","cascades","TLR antiviral","ubiquitin modification of proteins","RLR","antiviral posture","antiviral cytokines","NLR","Ubiquitin modifications","ubiquitin modification system","expression","places host cells","nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","inducible gene","type","interferon","Toll","danger signals","retinoic acid","Viral infection","growing number of viruses"],"language":"en"},

Using SELDI-TOF MS as an example, the presence of systemic bias in biomarker discovery studies employing MALDI-TOF MS and its possible solutions are also discussed in this chapter. The concepts of MALDI, SALDI, SELDI, and PFM are complementary to each other. Theoretically, all these technologies can be combined, leading to the next generation of the MALDI MS technologies.

Abstract The development of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies and of protease inhibitors in particular has permitted in the last ten years to dramatically improve the viral replication in HIV infected patients but the incidence of side effects and of diarrhoea in particular remains high. In general practice, the occurrence of diarrhoea should systematically lead to eliminate an infectious \u00E6tiology of diarrhoea. Many studies have demonstrated that diarrhoea under protease inhibitors and nelfinavir in particular are of a low grade severity, occurring usually at the onset of therapy and are responsible for discontinuation of treatment in less than 2% of cases. The medium term follow up of patients cohorts demonstrates the lack of impact of diarrhoea on the antiretroviral efficacy of protease inhibitors. Nevertheless, coexisting diarrhoea is a factor of poor quality of life. This should lead to propose to patients several simple therapies, including dietetic rules, in order to limit the incidence of diarrhoea and to improve its consequences on the quality of life of patients.","publish_time":"2003-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dellamonica, P","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1af17aeb813c36af4a0bc30d80cb98bd1421e42f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126713.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X02004791; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X02004791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of diarrhoea","patients VIH","patients cohorts","occurrence of diarrhoea","coexisting diarrhoea","HIV infected patients","infectious \u00E6tiology of diarrhoea","diarrh\u00E9es sous IP et sous nelfinavir en particulier sont","En pr\u00E9sence d\u2019une diarrh\u00E9e","diarrh\u00E9e et d\u2019am\u00E9liorer son impact sur","coexistence d\u2019une diarrh\u00E9e","antiretroviral efficacy of protease inhibitors","traitement et sont responsables d\u2019un arr\u00EAt","effets secondaires et notamment","diarrh\u00E9e demeure \u00E9lev\u00E9e","ces diarrh\u00E9es sont g\u00EAnantes","Active Antiretroviral Therapies","particular remains high","mais l\u2019incidence","limiter l\u2019incidence","lack of impact","simple therapies","factor of poor quality of life","traitement dans moins","nombreux traitements simples comprenant","nombreux travaux montrent que","suivi \u00E0 moyen terme","leur efficacit\u00E9 antir\u00E9trovirale li\u00E9e \u00E0","s\u00E9v\u00E9rit\u00E9 l\u00E9g\u00E8re ou mod\u00E9r\u00E9e","cohortes montre l\u2019absence d\u2019alt\u00E9ration","ne surviennent habituellement qu\u2019\u00E0 l\u2019initiation","r\u00E8gles di\u00E9t\u00E9tiques doivent permettre","une \u00E9tiologie infectieuse doit syst\u00E9matiquement \u00EAtre recherch\u00E9e","c\u2019est pourquoi","HAART","r\u00E9plication virale chez","th\u00E9rapies antir\u00E9trovirales hautement actives","consid\u00E9rablement am\u00E9liorer","contr\u00F4le","permis","inhibiteurs","qualit\u00E9","prot\u00E9ase","d\u00E9veloppement","viral replication","effects","dietetic rules","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","N\u00E9anmoins","order","low grade severity","onset of therapy","development","general practice","medium term","consequences","discontinuation of treatment","years","studies","cases"],"language":"en"},

The study assessed the impact of cattle pasturing/riparian zone protection on: pathogen (bacterial, viral, parasite) occurrence, concentrations of fecal indicators, and quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) of the risk of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in humans. Methodologies were developed to compute QMRA mean risks on the basis of water samples exhibiting potentially human infectious Cryptosporidium and E. coli based on genotyping Crytosporidium, and E. coli O157:H7 presence/absence information paired with enumerated E. coli. All Giardia spp. were considered infectious. No significant pasturing treatment effects were observed among pathogens, with the exception of Campylobacter spp. and E. coli O157:H7. Campylobacter spp. prevalence significantly decreased downstream through pasture treatments and E. coli O157:H7 was observed in a few instances in the middle of the unrestricted pasture. Densities of total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli reduced significantly downstream in the restricted pasture system, but not in the unrestricted system. Seasonal and flow conditions were associated with greater indicator bacteria densities, especially in the summer. Norovirus GII was detected at rates of 7\u201322% of samples for all monitoring sites, and rotavirus in 0\u20137% of samples for all monitoring sites; pasture treatment trends were not evident, however. Seasonal and stream flow variables (and their interactions) were relatively more important than pasture treatments for initially stratifying pathogen occurrence and higher fecal indicator bacteria densities. Significant positive associations among fecal indicator bacteria and Campylobacter spp. detection were observed. For QMRA, adjusting for the proportion of Cryptosporidium spp. detected that are infectious for humans reduces downstream risk estimates by roughly one order of magnitude. Using QMRA in this manner provides a more refined estimate of beneficial management practice effects on pathogen exposure risks to humans.","publish_time":"2013-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkes, G.; Brassard, J.; Edge, T.

The dose\u2013response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen\u2010binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to the development of mechanistic dose\u2013response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","publish_time":"2014-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gale, P.; Hill, A.; Kelly, L.; Bassett, J.; McClure, P.; Le Marc, Y.; Soumpasis, I.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52d0ae243a41f205f22bf7eea395c055dc6ceda4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.12656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["basis of omics data","response models","host population","molecular level","initial infection","individual host","application of omics","omics\u2019 data available","present","molecular markers","omics techniques","molecular mechanisms","results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses","development of mechanistic dose","average probability of infection","great strength of gene sequence data","feasibility of assigning probabilities","quantitative estimation of probabilities","predicting specificities","faeces","particular reference","prediction of risks","oral route","direct estimates","binding receptor","norovirus","vomitus","infected recipients","donor humans","proportion of susceptible genotypes","distribution","example","presence","appropriate pathogen","amino acid sequences","gastrointestinal tract","disease progression","microbiological risk assessment","mutant spectrum","component steps","case study","broad predictions","paper","virion","nature","information","alternative approach","consequences of exposure","aim"],"language":"en"},

Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. These differences in viral types highlight the broad spectrum of Arb antiviral activity and, therefore, it must affect a common viral critical step. Arbidol incorporates rapidly into biological membranes, and some of its antiviral effects might be related to its capacity to interact with and locate into the membrane. However, no information is available of the molecular basis of its antiviral mechanism/s. We have aimed to locate the protonated (Arp) and unprotonated (Arb) forms of arbidol in a model membrane system. Both Arb and Arp locate in between the hydrocarbon acyl chains of the phospholipids but its specific location and molecular interactions differ from each other. Whereas both Arb and Arp average location in the membrane palisade is a similar one, Arb tends to be perpendicular to the membrane surface, whereas Arp tends to be parallel to it. Furthermore, Arp, in contrast to Arb, seems to interact stronger with POPG than with POPC, implying the existence of a specific interaction between Arp, the protonated from, with negatively charged phospholipids. This data would suggest that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would be defined by the perturbation it exerts on membrane structure and therefore membrane functioning.

As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses depend on the translation machinery of the host and can manipulate it by affecting the availability and function of specific eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Human norovirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family and is responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks. Previous studies on feline calicivirus and murine norovirus 1 (MNV1) demonstrated that the viral protein, genome-linked (VPg), acts to direct translation by hijacking the host protein synthesis machinery. Here we report that MNV1 infection modulates the MAPK pathway to activate eIF4E phosphorylation. Our results show that the activation of p38 and Mnk during MNV1 infection is important for MNV1 replication. Furthermore, phosphorylated eIF4E relocates to the polysomes, and this contributes to changes in the translational state of specific host mRNAs. We propose that global translational control of the host by eIF4E phosphorylation is a key component of the host-pathogen interaction.","publish_time":"2015-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Royall, Elizabeth; Doyle, Nicole; Abdul-Wahab, Azimah; Emmott, Ed; Morley, Simon J.; Goodfellow, Ian; Roberts, Lisa O.; Locker, Nicolas","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e1f8ec1fffc3e243c9c5b53baf146f0e7c6ddb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4335213.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561727/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m114.602649","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MNV1 infection","host protein synthesis machinery","MNV1 replication","eIF4E phosphorylation","viral protein","viral infection","host-pathogen interaction","translational state of specific host mRNAs","translation machinery","phosphorylated eIF4E","direct translation","murine norovirus","Human norovirus","global translational control","function of specific eukaryotic initiation factors","key component","feline calicivirus","Caliciviridae family","viruses","VPg","Mnk","MAPK pathway","Previous studies","activation of p38","member","availability","eIFs","changes","stimuli","controlled process","gastroenteritis outbreaks","obligate intracellular parasites","acts","polysomes","genome","results"],"language":"en"},

To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats.

However, the direct effects of membrane lipids on viral replicases are still poorly understood. Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) protein A, which associates with mitochondrial membranes, is the sole replicase required for RNA replication. Here, we report that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane lipids (MMLs) stimulated the RNA binding activity and cooperativity of protein A, and such stimulations exhibited strong selectivity for distinct phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, manipulating MML metabolism affected the protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells. Together, our findings reveal the direct effects of membrane lipids on the RNA binding activity of a nodaviral replicase.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Yang; Miao, Meng; Wang, Zhaowei; Liu, Yongxiang; Yang, Jie; Xia, Hongjie; Li, Xiao-Feng; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de45c0fb4263dda95f48b9bb7fca75fcf89dd93e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092456/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214002360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214002360; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.05.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA binding of protein","RNA binding activity","RNA-binding cooperativity","RNA viruses","cooperativity of protein","WhNV protein","higher protein","mitochondrial membrane lipids","MMLs","direct effects of membrane lipids","Abstract RNA replication of positive","lipids present","mitochondrial membranes","viral replicases associate","sole replicase","intracellular membranes","nodaviral replicase","induced RNA1 recruitment","sites","strand","stimulations","binds","strong selectivity","distinct phospholipids","cooperative manner","cells","Wuhan nodavirus","concentrations","findings","MML metabolism","self-interaction","investigation"],"language":"en"},

A highly virulent feline coronavirus epidemic in African cheetahs, a disease model for human SARS, illustrates the critical role of ancestral population genetic variation. Widespread prevalence of species specific feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a relative of HIV\u2013AIDS, occurs with little pathogenesis in felid species, except in domestic cats, suggesting immunological adaptation in species where FIV is endemic. Resolving the interaction of host and pathogen genomes can shed new light on the process of disease outbreak in wildlife and in humankind. The role of disease in endangered populations and species is difficult to access as opportunities to monitor outbreaks in natural populations are limited. Conservation management may benefit greatly from advances in molecular genetic tools developed for human biomedical research to assay the biodiversity of both host species and emerging pathogen. As these examples illustrate, strong parallels exist between disease in human and endangered wildlife and argue for an integration of the research fields of comparative genomics, infectious disease, epidemiology, molecular genetics and population biology for an effective proactive conservation approach.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Brien, Stephen J.; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Roelke, Melody; Marker, Laurie; Pecon-Slattery, Jill","journal":"Biological Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e6b73d51d61ad48fafd815566fa6d68ae224d20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096731.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320706001935; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706001935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226081/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","role of disease","wild species","felid species","disease model","process of disease outbreak","Abstract Research studies of infectious disease outbreaks","human biomedical research","population biology","Widespread prevalence of species specific feline immunodeficiency virus","molecular genetic tools","FIV","genetic resistance","human SARS","endangered wildlife","endangered populations","critical role of ancestral population genetic variation","shape population survival","molecular genetics","research fields of comparative genomics","pathogen genomes","emerging pathogen","interaction of host","natural populations","Conservation management","virulent feline coronavirus epidemic","effective proactive conservation approach","epidemiology","unusual details","African cheetahs","forces","cat family Felidae","new light","biodiversity","immunological adaptation","domestic cats","advances","integration","opportunities","little pathogenesis","AIDS","relative of HIV","strong parallels","humankind"],"language":"en"},

Although the principle may be straightforward, this review highlights some of the controversies regarding the implementation and efficacy of these interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Hand hygiene compliance is an accepted measure of quality and safety in many countries. The evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene in directly reducing rates of hospital-acquired infections has strengthened in recent years, particularly in terms of reduced rates of staphylococcal sepsis. Defining the key components of effective implementation strategies and the ideal method(s) of assessing hand hygiene compliance are dependent on a range of factors associated with the healthcare system. Although patient isolation continues to be an important strategy, particularly in outbreaks, it also has some limitations and can be associated with negative effects. Recent detailed molecular epidemiology studies of key healthcare-acquired pathogens have questioned the true efficacy of isolation, alone as an effective method for the routine prevention of disease transmission. SUMMARY: Hand hygiene and isolation are key components of basic infection control. Recent insights into the benefits, limitations and even adverse effects of these interventions are important for their optimal implementation.","publish_time":"2014-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin Huang, G.

This view point describes how the One Health approach was used in Qatar to manage the MERS-CoV outbreak during the period 2012\u20132017. One Health focuses on the association between the human, animals and environment sectors for total health and wellbeing of these three sectors. To manage the MERS outbreak in Qatar through a One Health approach, the Qatar National Outbreak Control Taskforce (OCT) was reactivated in November 2012. The animal health sector was invited to join the OCT. Later on, technical expertise was requested from the WHO, FAO, CDC, EMC, and PHE. Subsequently, a comprehensive One Health roadmap was delivered through leadership and coordination; surveillance and investigation; epidemiological studies and increase of local diagnostic capacity. The joint OCT, once trained had easy access to allocated resources and high risk areas to provide more evidence on the potential source of the virus and to investigate all reported cases within 24\u201348 h.

Immunosuppression is used to treat AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid is used to slow the progression of PBC. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with both disorders progress to liver failure. Following liver transplantation, up to a third of patients with PBC experience recurrent disease. Moreover a syndrome referred to as \u201Cde novo AIH\u201D occurs in a proportion of patients regardless of maintenance immunosuppression, who have been transplanted for disorders unrelated to AIH. Of note, the use of cyclosporine A appears to protect against the development of recurrent PBC and de novo AIH even though it is a less potent immunosuppressive compared to tacrolimus. The reason why cyclosporine A is protective has not been determined. However, a virus resembling mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been characterized in patients with PBC and AIH. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the protective effect of cyclosporine A in liver transplant recipients may be mediated by the antiviral activity of this cyclophilin inhibitor. Treatment of the MMTV producing MM5MT cells with different antivirals and immunosuppressive agents showed that both cyclosporine A and the analogue NIM811 inhibited MMTV production from the producer cells. Herein, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of MMTV-like human betaretrovirus in the development of PBC and de novo AIH and speculate on the possibility that the agent may be associated with disease following transplantation. We also review the mechanisms of how both cyclosporine A and NIM811 may inhibit betaretrovirus production in vitro.","publish_time":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wasilenko, Shawn T.; Montano-Loza, Aldo J.; Mason, Andrew L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/979d953fe8641bdfaf6479a9b479923aae95c86b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3640509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23348060/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v5020423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIH","PBC","MMTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novo AIH","development of PBC","progression of PBC","development of recurrent PBC","proportion of patients","use of cyclosporine","liver transplantation","PBC experience recurrent disease","protective effect of cyclosporine","role of MMTV","liver failure","autoimmune liver diseases","analogue NIM811 inhibited MMTV production","betaretrovirus production","liver transplant recipients","MM5MT cells","producer cells","immunosuppressive agents","human betaretrovirus","disorders progress","Autoimmune hepatitis","disorders unrelated","maintenance immunosuppression","mouse mammary tumor virus","different antivirals","primary biliary cirrhosis","antiviral activity","cyclophilin inhibitor","Treatment","possibility","ursodeoxycholic acid","tacrolimus","evidence","note","reason","syndrome","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Apart from bacterial infections, paramyxo-, adeno-, reo- and arenaviruses cause these diseases. In 2014, new viruses emerged as the cause of pneumonia in pythons. In a few publications, nidoviruses have been reported in association with pneumonia in ball pythons and a tiger python. The viruses were found using new sequencing methods from the organ tissue of dead animals. METHODS: Severe pneumonia and stomatitis resulted in a high mortality rate in a captive breeding collection of green tree pythons. Unbiased deep sequencing lead to the detection of nidoviral sequences. A developed RT-qPCR was used to confirm the metagenome results and to determine the importance of this virus. A total of 1554 different boid snakes, including animals suffering from respiratory diseases as well as healthy controls, were screened for nidoviruses. Furthermore, in addition to two full-length sequences, partial sequences were generated from different snake species. RESULTS: The assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes share only an overall genome sequence identity of less than 66.9% to other published snake nidoviruses and new partial sequences vary between 99.89 and 79.4%. Highest viral loads were detected in lung samples. The snake nidovirus was not only present in diseased animals, but also in snakes showing no typical clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further highlight the possible importance of snake nidoviruses in respiratory diseases and proof multiple circulating strains with varying disease potential. Nidovirus detection in clinical healthy individuals might represent testing during the incubation period or reconvalescence. Our investigations show new aspects of nidovirus infections in pythons. Nidoviruses should be included in routine diagnostic workup of diseased reptiles.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blahak, Silvia; Jenckel, Maria; H\u00F6per, Dirk; Beer, Martin; Hoffmann, Bernd; Schlottau, Kore","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8d17ed0a635b0771ab27b88b15e868759b1dfb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6969405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31952524/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-1279-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["published snake nidoviruses","new partial sequences","possible importance of snake nidoviruses","respiratory diseases","Nidovirus detection","full-length sequences","different snake species","Severe pneumonia","new viruses","cause of pneumonia","new aspects of nidovirus infections","different captive snakes","new sequencing methods","assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes","fatal diseases","ball pythons","diseased animals","detection of nidoviral sequences","different boid snakes","stomatitis","captive breeding collection of green tree pythons","clinical healthy individuals","organ tissue of dead animals","healthy controls","bacterial infections","metagenome results","typical clinical signs","Unbiased deep sequencing lead","routine diagnostic workup of diseased reptiles","proof multiple circulating strains","testing","high mortality rate","varying disease potential","adeno","overall genome sequence identity","paramyxo","reo","investigations","association","Highest viral loads","lung samples","incubation period","tiger python","reconvalescence","findings","arenaviruses","total","BACKGROUND","addition","developed RT-qPCR","CONCLUSIONS","publications"],"language":"en"},

Determination of microbial etiology is critical to develop evidence-based management (therapeutic and prophylactic) decisions. For decades, the approach to this relied on culture of lung aspirate specimens obtained from children with radiographically confirmed pneumonia, before administering antibiotics. Such studies revealed the major bacteria associated with pneumonia, prompting the World Health Organization to develop a highly sensitive clinical definition of pneumonia and advocate empiric antibiotic therapy; in order to save lives (focusing on community settings lacking resources for diagnostic tests). However, it spawned research studies conducted in/from/by institutions enrolling children with the relatively non-specific WHO definition of pneumonia. Specificity got further compromised by abandoning lung aspiration and using naso/oro pharyngeal specimens; even in children who had received antibiotics. This led to the recovery of viruses more often than bacteria. The use of highly sensitive molecular based diagnostics (especially PCR) facilitated the detection of multiple organisms (bacteria, viruses, atypical organisms and even fungal species); making it difficult to attribute etiology in individual cases. This challenge was sought to be addressed through the multi-site PERCH Study (Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health), designed as a case-control study to conclusively determine the etiology of pneumonia. However, despite a slew of publications, the answer to the central question of etiology has not emerged so far. Since none of the PERCH Study sites was located in India, the Community Acquired Pneumonia Etiology Study (CAPES) was conducted at Chandigarh. This turned out to be the largest single-centre pneumonia etiology study, and generated a wealth of data. This article summarizes the current challenges in pneumonia etiology research; outlines the key observations from the PERCH and CAPES projects, as well as other important studies; and suggests a way forward for pneumonia etiology research in the current era.","publish_time":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathew, Joseph L.","journal":"Indian J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e16072734dff5a66dcdd1c147957daf02444f84d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090409.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-017-2486-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["India","Chandigarh"],"keyphrases":["etiology of pneumonia","Pneumonia Etiology Research","confirmed pneumonia","largest single-centre pneumonia etiology study","sensitive clinical definition of pneumonia","central question of etiology","Determination of microbial etiology","PERCH Study sites","children","spawned research studies","multi-site PERCH Study","community settings","community levels","Childhood community","important studies","case-control study","major bacteria","antibiotics","important clinical problem","atypical organisms","sensitive molecular based diagnostics","Child Health","current challenges","CAPES projects","culture of lung aspirate specimens","current era","lung aspiration","individual cases","recovery of viruses","evidence-based management","oro pharyngeal specimens","detection of multiple organisms","World Health Organization","advocate empiric antibiotic therapy","PCR","key observations","India","order","naso","answer","way","fungal species","prophylactic","resources","diagnostic tests","lives","decisions","article","slew of publications","approach","institutions","wealth of data","decades","Specificity","Chandigarh"],"language":"en"},

A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006\u20132014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000\u20132013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons. The evidence on co-circulation of two influenza B lineages and mismatched seasons in Brazil indicates the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in conferring broader seasonal influenza protection. Additionally, improving influenza surveillance platforms in Brazil is important for monitoring disease trends and the impact of introducing seasonal influenza vaccination.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barros, Eliana Nogueira Castro de; Cintra, Otavio; Rossetto, Erika; Freitas, La\u00EDs; Colindres, Romulo","journal":"The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59b8223515bc831a32ce6fb0da66f6a671464b3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110561.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867015001981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26626166/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2015.09.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867015001981","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["influenza seasons","circulating influenza B lineage","Co-circulation of influenza B lineages","circulation patterns of influenza B lineages","pattern of influenza B occurrence","influenza surveillance platforms","seasonal influenza vaccination","moderate levels of influenza B disease","seasonal influenza vaccine composition","Brazil","broader seasonal influenza protection","benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines","local surveillance data","Abstract Data","vaccine lineage","international epidemiologic surveillance data","years","notable levels of co-circulation","unpredictable circulation pattern","predominant circulating lineage","burden of disease","Victoria lineage","monitoring disease trends","significant cause of disease","screening of abstracts","information","prevalent circulating viruses","mismatched seasons","review","Southern hemisphere vaccine","analysis of international","high degree of mismatch","dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses","Medical Subject Headings terms","conjunction","online search of databases","relevance","impact","reemergence","published literature","epidemiology","better understanding","scientific events","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Direct and competitive ELISA methods have been used to evaluate the binding of antibodies from scleroderma patients\u2019 and controls\u2019 sera to the NAG-2 peptide.

The anti-NAG-2 human mAb we have obtained blocks signal transduction and therefore may be a potential candidate for a new treatment in SSc, a disease where the current biological therapies have little or no efficacy.","publish_time":"2010-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Traggiai, Elisabetta; Lunardi, Claudio; Bason, Caterina; Dolcino, Marzia; Tinazzi, Elisa; Corrocher, Roberto; Puccetti, Antonio","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2e9914423d4507baffe0635790e5bfedbe4e06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108599.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxq016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20207716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tetraspanin NAG","apoptosis of endothelial cells","effect of serum pathogenetic anti-NAG","endothelial cell apoptosis","binding of antibodies","patients\u2019 memory B cells","human mAb","molecule","majority of SSc patients present antibodies","scleroderma patients\u2019","Patients\u2019 Igs","non-functional mAb","IgG memory B cells","fibroblast proliferation","potential candidate","disease","functional assays","functional property","functional activity","cell surface tetraspanin transmembrane","potential novel candidate","activation of fibroblasts","superfamily member","cytomegalovirus-derived protein UL94 cross","controls\u2019 sera","current biological therapies","therapeutic intervention","TM4SF7","new treatment","features","standard conditions","systemic sclerosis","blocks signal transduction","fraction","EBV","competitive ELISA methods","efficacy","specific mAbs","peptide","generation"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, viruses can encode their own miRNAs, trigger changes in cellular miRNA expression or encode RNA silencing suppressor factors that inhibit cellular miRNAs. These interactions together form a complex regulatory network that controls both viral and host gene expression, which ultimately determines the outcome of viral infection at the cellular level and disease progression in the host.

METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among Presidents and Members of the Societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information about local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS\u00AE software. Results Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen Society Presidents reported having suspended regular activities, and differing local scheduled congresses, fourteen reported mandatory isolation by government, and four instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons had savings to self-support for 3-6 months, if restrictions are long lasting. Conclusions Stopping activities among Societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider\u00B4s protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the healthcare systems; representing a huge financial risk for their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should involve in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as non-essential care can turn essential if left untreated.

The health systems need to be strengthened through extending the health workforce by mobilizing and engaging the diaspora, and implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) core capacities. In the absence of adequate social protection and welfare programs targeting the poor during the pandemic, sub-Saharan African countries need to put in place flexible but effective policies and legislation approaches that harness and formalise the informal trade and remove supply chain barriers. This could include strengthening cross-border trade facilities such as adequate pro-poor, gender-sensitive, and streamlined cross-border customs, tax regimes, and information flow. The emphasis should be on cross-border infrastructure that not only facilitates trade through efficient border administration but can also effectively manage cross-border health threats.

Objectives We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Study design Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. Results 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8).

Recently, influenza virus-like sequences were identified in bats; however, the viruses could not be cultured. This discovery aroused great interest in understanding the evolutionary history and pandemic potential of bat-influenza. Using synthetic genomics, we were unable to rescue the wild type bat virus, but could rescue a modified bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1). This modified bat-influenza virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in mice, resulting in severe disease. Additional studies using a bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA of A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) showed that the PR8 HA and NA contributed to the pathogenicity in mice. Unlike other influenza viruses, engineering truncations hypothesized to reduce interferon antagonism into the NS1 protein didn\u0027t attenuate bat-influenza. In contrast, substitution of a putative virulence mutation from the bat-influenza PB2 significantly attenuated the virus in mice and introduction of a putative virulence mutation increased its pathogenicity. Mini-genome replication studies and virus reassortment experiments demonstrated that bat-influenza has very limited genetic and protein compatibility with Type A or Type B influenza viruses, yet it readily reassorts with another divergent bat-influenza virus, suggesting that the bat-influenza lineage may represent a new Genus/Species within the Orthomyxoviridae family. Collectively, our data indicate that the bat-influenza viruses recently identified are authentic viruses that pose little, if any, pandemic threat to humans; however, they provide new insights into the evolution and basic biology of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2014-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Bin; Ma, Jingjiao; Liu, Qinfang; Bawa, Bhupinder; Wang, Wei; Shabman, Reed S.; Duff, Michael; Lee, Jinhwa; Lang, Yuekun; Cao, Nan; Nagy, Abdou; Lin, Xudong; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Richt, Juergen A.; Wentworth, David E.; Ma, Wenjun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b84e5b51b40b345b68445d68483cc478e9ce5beb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4183581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275541/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat-influenza viruses","modified bat-influenza virus","bat-influenza PB2","bat-influenza lineage","divergent bat-influenza virus","Type B influenza viruses","wild type bat virus","basic biology of influenza viruses","pandemic potential of bat","authentic viruses","virus reassortment experiments","mice","putative virulence mutation","PR8 HA","pathogenicity","humans","Bats","NA coding regions","protein compatibility","NS1 protein","new Genus","new insights","Additional studies","pandemic threat","outbreaks of disease","severe disease","Mini-genome replication studies","interferon antagonism","evolutionary history","engineering truncations","introduction","Ebola","Species","substitution","Orthomyxoviridae family","Texas","H3N2","contrast","swine","sequences","SARS-CoV","synthetic genomics","data","H1N1","discovery"],"language":"en"},

Modulation of the innate immune system might fulfill this requirement. Hackett\u0027s previous review of innate immune activation as a broad-spectrum biodefense strategy identified several unresolved questions. The current article is a systematic approach to answering those questions with the focused participation of research groups developing this technology. Our team of academic and industry participants reviewed the promising agents and came to the following conclusions. It is feasible to construct a biodefense platform combining synergistic agents that activate the innate immune system against a broad range of pathogens on the basis of conserved microbial components by using a nasal spray for immune activation in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts because these are the most likely routes of attack. It might also be possible to include agents that inhibit molecular events leading to septic shock. Innate immune-activating agents designed to activate Toll-like and other receptors will probably provide protection against the biothreat pathogen spectrum for periods ranging from 2 to 14 days for IFNs up to 26 weeks for immunomodulatory oligonucleotides. Initial treatment is proposed on the first index case or biosensor alert. Boost doses would be required. Harmful inflammation is possible, but thus far, only transient fever has been observed. Autoimmune reaction and retroviral activation have not been seen thus far in preclinical and human trials of many of these compounds. Toll-like receptor agonists caused cytokine production in all subjects tested, but genetic polymorphism reduced the response to IFN in African American subjects.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amlie-Lefond, Catherine; Paz, David A.; Connelly, Mary P.; Huffnagle, Gary B.; Dunn, Kyle S.; Whelan, Noel T.; Whelan, Harry T.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb56456b72f8bba692fabc31db87f76cf37a6c71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127501.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167490501938X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167490501938X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hackett"],"organizations":["Toll-like"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune system","biothreat agents","promising agents","synergistic agents","Hackett\u0027s previous review of innate immune activation","retroviral activation","broad-spectrum approach","Toll","broad-spectrum biodefense strategy","biodefense platform","unresolved questions","systematic approach","African American subjects","biothreat pathogen spectrum","response","nasal spray","broad range of pathogens","basis of conserved microbial components","industry participants","focused participation of research groups","receptor agonists","cytokine production","molecular events","weeks","protection","periods","genetic polymorphism","gastrointestinal tracts","index case","team of academic","human trials","biosensor alert","IFNs","days","septic shock","technology","current article","Autoimmune reaction","Modulation","requirement","immunomodulatory oligonucleotides","following conclusions","likely routes of attack","compounds","Harmful inflammation","receptors","Initial treatment","Boost doses","transient fever"],"language":"en"},

Study design A total of 150 clinical specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), were used to determine the extraction efficiency of the MinElute compared to the other two methods. Nucleic acid recovery, hands-on time, turn-around-time and cost were compared across all kits. Results There was complete concordance between the MinElute and IsoQuick/RNAzol kits when herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza A virus or enteroviruses were detected using a colorimetric microtiter plate PCR system. The kits were equivalent in their ability to detect either DNA or RNA with superior ability to recover a high quality and quantity of RNA.

Passive immunization of HAV plays an extremely important role in post-exposure prophylaxis with clinical applications often requiring large amounts of antibody. As an alternative to the in vitro production of recombinant proteins, expression of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the milk of transgenic animals is currently used being associated with low production costs and high activity. In this paper, eight founder lines of transgenic mice were generated by co-microinjection of the two cassettes encoding the heavy- and light-chains of a neutralizing anti-HAV antibody, respectively. The expressed heavy- and light-chains of the mAb were correctly assembled and modified in the mammary gland as detected by western blotting. High expression levels of the antibody were achieved during the lactation period and found to be independent of the copy numbers of integrated transgenes. The highest level was up to 32.2 mg/ml. The binding specificity and neutralizing activity of the expressed mAb were assayed by ELISA and neutralizing test, showing that it is capable to neutralize the JN strain of Hepatitis A virus efficiently. Therefore, our results suggest that a large-scale and efficient production of the anti-HAV mAb in the milk of transgenic farm animals would be feasible in the future.","publish_time":"2009-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ran; Rao, Man; Li, Chuan; Cao, Jingyuan; Meng, Qinglin; Zheng, Min; Wang, Meili; Dai, Yunping; Liang, Mifang; Li, Ning","journal":"Transgenic Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2d1bbf38047c7d11c67d3e234c0db5ccc1b4bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089081.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11248-008-9241-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19130282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HAV mAb","neutralizing anti-HAV antibody","neutralizing activity","expressed mAb","milk of transgenic animals","efficient production","light-chains","milk of transgenic farm animals","Passive immunization of HAV","high activity","neutralizing test","virus","production of recombinant proteins","large amounts of antibody","low production costs","High expression levels","JN strain of Hepatitis","founder lines of transgenic mice","common cause of acute Hepatitis","expression of monoclonal antibodies","clinical applications","post-exposure prophylaxis","important role","wide spread pathogenic agent","mAbs","co-microinjection","cassettes","ELISA","copy numbers of integrated transgenes","binding specificity","mammary gland","western blotting","lactation period","paper","results","future","alternative","highest level"],"language":"en"},

In this study, it was investigated whether CMV DNA is detected in the lower respiratory tract and the systemic compartment in pediatric patients with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases. A total of 42 lower respiratory tract specimens and 11 paired plasma samples from 42 patients were analyzed for the presence of CMV DNA by real\u2010time PCR. The respiratory specimens were also screened for the presence of respiratory viruses and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV\u20106) and 7 (HHV\u20107) by PCR methods. Quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures were performed. IL\u20106 levels in the respiratory specimens were quantified using ELISA. CMV DNA was detected either in the lower respiratory airways, in plasma, or both in 54.5% of CMV\u2010seropositive patients. The levels of IL\u20106 were significantly higher in these patients than in those with no detectable levels of CMV DNA. HHV\u20106 and HHV\u20107 DNA were detected in three and one patients, respectively. Respiratory viruses were detected in 13 of the 42 patients. Significant growth of one or more bacterial species was observed in 17 patients. No significant association was found between the presence of CMV DNA and the detection of other microorganisms. The data indicated that the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract is a frequent finding in children with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases.

To continuously monitor the epidemic-related CoVs in bats, virome analysis was used to classify CoVs from 831 bats of 15 species in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Sichuan Provinces between August 2016 and May 2017. We identified 11 CoV strains from 22 individual samples of four bat species. Identification of four alpha-CoVs from Scotophilus kuhlii in Guangxi, which was closely related to a previously reported bat CoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), revealed a bat-swine lineage under the genus Alphacoronavirus. A recombinant CoV showed that the PEDV probably originated from the CoV of S. kuhlii. Another alpha-CoV, \u03B1-YN2018, from Rhinolophus affinis in Yunnan, suggested that this alpha-CoV lineage had multiple host origins, and \u03B1-YN2018 had recombined with CoVs of other bat species over time. We identified five SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) in Rhinolophus bats from Sichuan and Yunnan and confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 usable SARSr-CoVs were continuously circulating in Rhinolophus spp. in Yunnan. The other beta-CoV, strain \u03B2-GX2018, found in Cynopterus sphinx of Guangxi, represented an independently evolved lineage different from known CoVs of Rousettus and Eonycteris bats.

One of the limitations of AAVP in mammalian cells may be its susceptibility to proteasomal degradation.

Since it was first reported in 2013, molecular evidence for FeKoV in the feline population has been restricted to two countries: Korea and Italy. In this study, we collected faecal samples from cats in southern China and detected the FeKoV RNA in these samples. A prevalence rate of 9.9% (8/81) was identified by RT\u2010PCR, and all positive samples were obtained from diarrhoeic animals. In addition, FeKoV was shown positive associated with diarrhoea in cats, with a correlation coefficient of 0.25. Next, we designed three primer pairs with degenerate bases, which targeted the conservative overlapping region of the entire published FeKoV genome, and sequenced the near\u2010complete genome of the first Chinese field FeKoV strain, WHJ\u20101, using long\u2010fragment PCR. Finally, we analysed WHJ\u20101\u0027s homology and phylogeny using the polyprotein gene. The results indicated that FeKoV has rapidly mutated since it was first discovered. This study will help to better understand FeKoV\u0027s epidemiology, evolutionary pattern and genetic diversity.","publish_time":"2018-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Gang; Zhang, Xin; Luo, Jie; Sun, Yankuo; Xu, Haibin; Huang, Ji; Ou, Jiajun; Li, Shoujun","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91102280058243cc4708e7970a19f79e9a32782f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29873199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["FeKoV RNA","entire published FeKoV genome","Chinese field FeKoV strain","positive samples","cats","faecal samples","WHJ","Feline kobuvirus","study","complete genome","feline population","genus Kobuvirus","discovered organism","fragment PCR","conservative overlapping region","southern China","evolutionary pattern","FeKoV\u0027s epidemiology","diarrhoea","degenerate bases","genetic diversity","s homology","species Aichivirus","phylogeny","polyprotein gene","molecular evidence","countries","primer pairs","diarrhoeic animals","addition","correlation coefficient","Korea","Italy","RT","results","prevalence rate"],"language":"en"},

The RTC directs and coordinates processes in order to replicate and transcribe the coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of outstanding length (\u223C27\u201332kilobases). Here, we review the up-to-date knowledge on SARS-CoV replicative enzymes encoded in the ORF1b, i.e., the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (nsp13), two unusual ribonucleases (nsp14, nsp15) and RNA-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16). We also review how these enzymes co-operate with other viral co-factors (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp10) to regulate their activity.

In this short review, we analyse the bibliometric aspects of these studies on a macro level, as well as those addressing Coronaviruses in general. Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed. Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention. These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety. These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks. Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haghani, Milad; Bliemer, Michiel C.J.; Goerlandt, Floris; Li, Jie","journal":"Saf Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4164d065cdf1722dc06361e5f0b8434c22c070aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203062.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382213/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520302034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302034?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104806","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["economic safety","social safety","food safety","safety of vaccines","domestic safety","cyber safety","various safety impacts","holistic safety-scientific understanding","patient transport safety","significant safety problems","supply-chain safety","main safety-related dimensions","occupational safety of healthcare professionals","COVID","scientific literature","scientific community","studies","global pandemic","collective scientific effort","various research domains","limited scientific focus","abundance of research","crisis","attention","findings","future pandemic","academic research perspective","global health emergency","psychological health","bibliometric aspects","clinical aspects","scoping analysis","holistic interdisciplinary approach","bio-medical risks","facilities","biosafety of laboratories","issues","treatments","relation","implications","matters","short review","macro level","outbreak","topic","Coronaviruses","months"],"language":"en"},

However, there is scarce knowledge about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. RESULTS: Here, we reveal that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25\u2019s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. We demonstrate that TRIM25 controls the levels of Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP). Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself (autoubiquitination) and its physiologically relevant target ZAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many other proteins with the PRY/SPRY domain could have yet uncharacterized RNA-binding potential.

The heterogeneous nature of the clinical manifestations and therapeutic responses of asthma in both adult and pediatric patients indicate that it may be more of a syndrome rather than a specific disease entity. Numerous triggering factors including viral infections, allergen and irritant exposure, and exercise, among others, complicate both the acute and chronic treatment of asthma. Therapeutic intervention has focused on the appreciation that airway obstruction in asthma is composed of both bronchial smooth muscle spasm and variable degrees of airway inflammation characterized by edema, mucus secretion, and the influx of a variety of inflammatory cells. The presence of only partial reversibility of airflow obstruction in some patients indicates that structural remodeling of the airways may also occur over time. Choosing appropriate medications depends on the disease severity (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, severe persistent), extent of reversibility, both acutely and chronically, patterns of disease activity (exacerbations related to viruses, allergens, exercise, etc), and the age of onset (infancy, childhood, adulthood).

Several models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but all of them implicitly assume that the process of virus replication itself does not contribute to genetic drift. We developed an assay to measure the amount of genetic drift for HIV populations replicating in cell culture. The assay relies on creation of HIV populations of known size and measurements of variation in frequency of a neutral allele. Using this assay, we show that HIV undergoes approximately ten times more genetic drift than would be expected from its population size, which we defined as the number of infected cells in the culture. We showed that a large portion of the increase in genetic drift is due to non-synchronous infection of target cells. When infections are synchronized, genetic drift for the virus is only 3-fold higher than expected from its population size. Thus, the stochastic nature of biological processes involved in viral replication contributes to increased genetic drift in HIV populations. We propose that appreciation of these effects will allow better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on HIV in infected patients.","publish_time":"2009-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voronin, Yegor; Holte, Sarah; Overbaugh, Julie; Emerman, Michael","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b710adc78b56eb091aa40bc4cf5bc015e3f567e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2652835.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19300501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic drift","creation of HIV populations of known size","assay","infected patients","large population sizes","Populations of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type","number of infected cells","large portion","process of virus replication","viral replication","cell culture","non-synchronous infection of target cells","measurements of variation","evolutionary forces","frequency","better understanding","stochastic nature of biological processes","increase","effects","neutral allele","times","appreciation","infections","models","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

DHPMs with a C-4 aryl moiety bearing halogen substitution (4b, 4c and 4d) were found to be cytotoxic in MT4 cells.","publish_time":"2017-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumarasamy, Dhanabal; Roy, Biswajit Gopal; Rocha-Pereira, Joana; Neyts, Johan; Nanjappan, Satheeshkumar; Maity, Subhasis; Mookerjee, Musfiqua; Naesens, Lieve","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f185b32a18bfdacbf3ce040737092b60609ded6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127791.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27979594/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X1631277X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X1631277X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.12.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRMS","Rift Valley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C NMR","H NMR","antiviral activity","Rift Valley fever virus","selective inhibitor of Punta Toro virus","potential cytotoxicity","assessment","broad range of DNA","diverse mammalian cell lines","RNA viruses","aryl moiety","halogen substitution","member","HRMS spectra","Bunyavirus","chain","dihydropyrimidine","ones","MT4 cells","Bunyaviridae","DHPMs","compounds","series"],"language":"en"},

Methods Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary interest and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. Results Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and the severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p =0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p =0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p =0.71).

What would ensue has become a largely unprecedented sequence of alarming events since the FDA began reporting public recalls, withdrawals and safety alerts on their website in 2016. Since then, the United States has been significantly impacted by drug recalls affecting angiotensin receptor blockers. This report arms clinicians with additional guidance and provides a framework for responding appropriately to future similar incidents and includes an overview of the angiotensin receptor blockers, and their effects and safety profiles. METHODS: This report includes a review of data from all pertinent clinical and scientific sources including information from the FDA\u2019s inspection documents and recall website. Additional information is provided on the specific bottles including all lot numbers, expiration dates, etc. RESULTS: The recalls/withdrawals are attributable to the presence of cancer-causing contaminants identified during the manufacturing process from drug manufacturers abroad. The root causes behind the recalls and subsequent shortage appear multifactorial, and stem to a certain extent from the outsourcing of medication manufacturing overseas and lack of quality checks and appropriate oversight. CONCLUSIONS: This inherent issue is not likely to resolve soon and has eroded the public trust of/in the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry. Patients and healthcare providers are significantly affected and should have a full understanding of the matter in order to guide appropriate response and actions.

We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model. METHODS: Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests. CONCLUSION: Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys. These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Jiaming; Yao, Yanfeng; Deng, Yao; Chen, Hong; Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Wen; Bao, Linlin; Deng, Wei; Wei, Qiang; Gao, George F.; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"EBioMedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd20636717b2150e71b69c9d62945a8f3a49b809.json; document_parses/pdf_json/26e505b0228a95ae17d9dfee8ce18ff2af4ddb0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634622.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352396415301158; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396415301158; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26629538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["rRBD vaccine","effective vaccine","oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys","different doses of rRBD","protein vaccine","rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia","effective human vaccine","MERS-CoV infection","Development","days","immunological responses","NHP","immunological tests","Immunological analysis","alum adjuvant","clinical signs","clinical manifestation","low-dose","high-dose","rectal swabs","final immunisation","different time points","rhesus macaque model","evidence of reduced tissue impairment","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","observation","trachea","viral load of lung","limited information","nonhuman primate","tissues","challenge","recombinant receptor-binding domain","multiple specimens","chest X-rays","mock groups","way","neutralisation antibody","CONCLUSION","Nasal","BACKGROUND","weeks","data","analyses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Proteomics profiling of monkey heart could reveal significant cardiac biomarkers and help us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of heart disease. However, the proteomic study of monkey heart is relatively lacking. Here, we performed the proteomics profiling of the normal monkey heart by measuring three major anatomical regions (vessels, valves, and chambers) based on iTRAQ\u2010coupled LC\u2010MS/MS analysis. Over 3,200 proteins were identified and quantified from three heart tissue samples. Furthermore, multiple bioinformatics analyses such as gene ontology analysis, protein\u2013protein interaction analysis, and gene\u2010diseases association were used to investigate biological network of those proteins from each area. More than 60 genes in three heart regions are implicated with heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. These genes associated with heart disease are mainly enriched in citrate cycle, amino acid degradation, and glycolysis pathway. At the anatomical level, the revelation of molecular characteristics of the healthy monkey heart would be an important starting point to investigate heart disease. As a unique resource, this study can serve as a reference map for future in\u2010depth research on cardiac disease\u2010related NHP model and novel biomarkers of cardiac injury.","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hao\u2010Liang; Kang, Yu; Zeng, Yong; Zhang, Ming; Liao, Qiong; Rong, Ming\u2010Qiang; Zhang, Qin; Lai, Ren","journal":"J Cell Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8a2882316256ca578ec31863059897cb66a4039.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30644093/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.28052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heart diseases","heart regions","heart failure","healthy monkey heart","normal monkey heart","pathogenesis of heart disease","Proteomics profiling of monkey heart","proteomic study of monkey heart","heart tissue samples","cardiac disease","MS analysis","gene ontology analysis","protein interaction analysis","significant cardiac biomarkers","proteins","novel biomarkers of cardiac injury","major anatomical regions","biomedical research","diseases association","anatomical level","future in\u2010depth research","related NHP model","amino acid degradation","genetics","revelation of molecular characteristics","important starting point","reference map","citrate cycle","hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","indispensable role","similarities","vessels","valves","multiple bioinformatics analyses","NHPs","neurological function","glycolysis pathway","biological network","LC","myocardial infarction","better understanding","humans","chambers","iTRAQ","Nonhuman primates","area","unique resource"],"language":"en"},

Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are at present available to combat EBOV infection, making the virus a potential threat to public health. To devise antiviral strategies, it is important to understand which components of the immune system could be effective against EBOV infection. The interferon (IFN) system constitutes a key innate defence against viral infections and prevents development of lethal disease in mice infected with EBOV strains not adapted to this host. Recent research revealed that expression of the host cell IFN\u2010inducible transmembrane proteins 1\u20133 (IFITM1\u20133) and tetherin is induced by IFN and restricts EBOV infection, at least in cell culture model systems. IFITMs, tetherin and other effector molecules of the IFN system could thus pose a potent barrier against EBOV spread in humans. However, EBOV interferes with signalling events required for human cells to express these proteins. Here, we will review the strategies employed by EBOV to fight the IFN system, and we will discuss how IFITM proteins and tetherin inhibit EBOV infection.","publish_time":"2012-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"K\u00FChl, A.; P\u00F6hlmann, S.","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e90edd075fd1c05194acb4b12d0f7499cf9853b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165950.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01454.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22958256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV infection","EBOV strains","IFN system","host cell IFN","tetherin","immune system","humans","IFITM proteins","inducible transmembrane proteins","antiviral strategies","Zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus","cell culture model systems","afflicted individuals","high case","viral infections","severe haemorrhagic fever","development of lethal disease","key innate defence","mice","expression","effector molecules","fatality rates","potential threat","potent barrier","public health","human cells","signalling events","vaccines","therapeutics","IFITMs","components","IFITM1","Recent research","interferon"],"language":"en"},

Methods Prospective, multicentre, randomized study in children presenting with FN at five hospitals in Santiago, Chile, evaluated at admission for diagnosis of bacterial and viral pathogens including PCR-microarray for 17 respiratory viruses. Children positive for a respiratory virus, negative for a bacterial pathogen and with a favourable evolution after 48 h of antimicrobial therapy were randomized to either maintain or withhold antimicrobials. Primary endpoint was percentage of episodes with uneventful resolution. Secondary endpoints were days of fever/hospitalization, bacterial infection, sepsis, admission to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and death. Results A total of 319 of 951 children with FN episodes recruited between July 2012 and December 2015 had a respiratory virus as a unique identified microorganism, of which 176 were randomized, 92 to maintain antimicrobials and 84 to withdraw. Median duration of antimicrobial use was 7 days (range 7\u20139 days) versus 3 days (range 3\u20134 days), with similar frequency of uneventful resolution (89/92 (97%) and 80/84 (95%), respectively, not significant; OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.32\u20136.83, p 0.61), and similar number of days of fever (2 versus 1), days of hospitalization (6 versus 6) and bacterial infections throughout the episode (2%\u20131%), with one case of sepsis requiring admission to PICU in the group that maintained antimicrobials, without any deaths. Conclusions The reduction of antimicrobials in children with FN and respiratory viral infections, based on clinical and microbiological/molecular diagnostic criteria, should favour the adoption of evidence-based management strategies in this population.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santolaya, M.

The objective of this study is to identify the clinical risk factors of SARS and to develop a scoring system for early diagnosis. Methods The detailed clinical data of all patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature higher than 38.0\u00B0C (100.3\u00B0F), documented at home or at the ED, and risks of exposure to SARS within 14 days were assessed. The diagnosis of probable SARS was made according to the definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Items with significant differences among symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests on presentation between SARS and non-SARS groups were determined and used to develop the scoring system. Results Seventy patients were enrolled and 8 were diagnosed as probably having SARS. None of the initially discharged patients or their relatives developed SARS. Compared with the non-SARS group, the SARS group was younger (33.9\u00B115.9 years versus 44\u00B19.8 years; P=.02), had a higher percentage of fever prolonged more than 5 days (87.5% versus 6.5%; P\u003C.01), myalgia (75% versus 27.4%; P=.01), and diarrhea (50% versus 9.7%; P=.02); had less occurrence of cough before or during fever (0% versus 64.5%; P=.01); and had lower absolute lymphocyte (0.9\u00B10.3\u00D7109/L versus 1.5\u00B11.1\u00D7109/L; P\u003C.01) and platelet counts (144.1\u00B136.3\u00D7109/L versus 211.6\u00B178.8\u00D7109/L; P=.02). A 4-item symptom score based on the presence of cough before or concomitant with fever, myalgia, diarrhea, and rhinorrhea or sore throat detects SARS with 100% sensitivity and 75.9% specificity; a 6-item clinical score based on lymphopenia (\u003C1.0\u00D7109/L), thrombocytopenia (\u003C150\u00D7109/L) and the 4 symptom items detects SARS with 100% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity.

The eradication of smallpox and the significant progress made toward polio eradication are clear examples of the great impact of antiviral vaccines.

Poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and rubella are examples of diseases that are now largely controlled thanks to these empirically developed vaccines. However, there is a growing list of viral pathogens against which effective vaccines are yet to be developed. Recent technological advances will potentially provide us with new platforms that could be harnessed to develop vaccines against emerging and reemerging viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellebedy, Ali H.; Ahmed, Rafi","journal":"The Vaccine Book","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6969a0ec11f133c8d770ad40f1e44da7be705641.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150210.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021743000151; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128021743000151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective vaccines","viral infections","great impact of antiviral vaccines","growing list of viral pathogens","significant progress","clear examples","polio eradication","examples of diseases","effective means","eradication of smallpox","significant cause of death","major public health threat","mumps","rubella","measles","Abstract Vaccination","controlled thanks","past century","Recent technological advances","Poliomyelitis","new platforms"],"language":"en"},

Soon after the deadly disease outbreak, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo for SARS-CoV spike protein. However, ACE2 solely is not sufficient to allow host cells to become susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and other host factors may be involved in SARS-CoV spike protein-ACE2 complex. RESULTS: A host intracellular filamentous cytoskeletal protein vimentin was identified by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis following chemical cross-linking on Vero E6 cells that were pre-incubated with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, flow cytometry data demonstrated an increase of the cell surface vimentin level by 16.5 % after SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells were treated with SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs). A direct interaction between SARS-CoV spike protein and host surface vimentin was further confirmed by far-Western blotting. In addition, antibody neutralization assay and shRNA knockdown experiments indicated a vital role of vimentin in cell binding and uptake of SARS-CoV VLPs and the viral spike protein. CONCLUSIONS: A direct interaction between vimentin and SARS-CoV spike protein during viral entry was observed. Vimentin is a putative anti-viral drug target for preventing/reducing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2016-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Yvonne Ting-Chun; Chien, Ssu-Chia; Chen, I-Yin; Lai, Chia-Tsen; Tsay, Yeou-Guang; Chang, Shin C.; Chang, Ming-Fu","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/634b79269e0f00d35bcea1a2dc7643884b8c6b3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4724099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-016-0234-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV virus","CoV VLPs","SARS-CoV spike protein-ACE2 complex","uptake of SARS","viral spike protein","SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells","host surface vimentin","host cells","host intracellular filamentous cytoskeletal protein vimentin","cell surface vimentin level","vital role of vimentin","host factors","viral entry","direct interaction","MS analysis","LC-MS","cell binding","putative anti-viral drug target","shRNA knockdown experiments","increase","chemical cross-linking","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","antibody neutralization assay","immunoprecipitation","BACKGROUND","angiotensin","global panic","high morbidity","addition","RESULTS","susceptibility","particles","deadly disease outbreak","flow cytometry data","enzyme","functional cellular receptor","CONCLUSIONS","mortality","Western blotting"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients at an ambulatory cancer center with URI diagnoses from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. We obtained antimicrobial prescribing, respiratory viral testing, and other clinical data at first encounter for the URI through day 14. We used generalized estimating equations to test associations of baseline factors with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: Of 341 charts reviewed, 251 (74%) patients were eligible for analysis. Nearly one-third (32%) of patients were prescribed antibiotics for URIs. Respiratory viruses were detected among 85 (75%) of 113 patients tested. Antibiotic prescribing (P = .001) and viral testing (P \u003C .001) varied by clinical service. Sputum production or chest congestion was associated with higher risk of antibiotic prescribing (relative risk [RR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4\u20133.8; P \u003C .001). Viral testing on day 0 was associated with lower risk of antibiotic prescribing (RR, 0.4; 95% CI 0.2\u20130.8; P = .01), though collinearity between viral testing and clinical service limited our ability to separate these effects on prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of hematology\u2013oncology outpatients were prescribed antibiotics for URIs, despite viral etiologies identified among 75% of those tested. Antibiotic prescribing was significantly lower among patients who received an initial respiratory viral test. The role of viral testing in antibiotic prescribing for URIs in outpatient oncology settings merits further study.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krantz, Elizabeth M; Zier, Jacqlynn; Stohs, Erica; Ogimi, Chikara; Sweet, Ania; Marquis, Sara; Klaassen, John; Pergam, Steven A; Liu, Catherine","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3848d1b2c5d0d6c2c8f873af30bb20a6e7cdab31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108137.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095276/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Outpatient antibiotic prescribing","antimicrobial prescribing","respiratory viral testing","lower risk of antibiotic prescribing","higher risk of antibiotic prescribing","role of viral testing","URIs","viral etiologies","cancer patients","initial respiratory viral test","clinical service","Respiratory viruses","retrospective cohort study of adult patients","relative risk","prescribed antibiotics","RR","clinical data","day","acute upper respiratory infections","outpatient oncology settings merits","oncology outpatients","antimicrobial stewardship","URI diagnoses","ambulatory cancer center","associations of baseline factors","chest congestion","high-priority target","ability","collinearity","generalized estimating equations","hematology","encounter","BACKGROUND","Sputum production","METHODS","confidence interval","analysis","effects","RESULTS","charts","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Outpatient radiographic findings were suspicious for basilar pneumonia. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics were started; however, she continued to deteriorate rapidly over the next 48 hours, with chest X-ray showing diffuse bilateral multifocal airspace opacities consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen was 225. She required a high-flow nasal cannula with a subsequent upgrade to the intensive care unit (ICU) for increasing respiratory compromise. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the nasopharyngeal aspirate confirmed human rhinovirus (hRV). High-dose intravenous steroids were started as adjuvant therapy due to the rapid decline, presumably due to a dysregulated host immune response. After 10 days in the ICU, she was discharged with tiotropium and steroid taper. Historically thought to be limited to pandemic viruses, improved detection of hRV has led to its implication in serious respiratory disorders extending beyond the oropharynx in immunocompetent hosts. We report a rare case of hRV-induced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in an immunocompetent host. This case highlights the need for the early identification of viral culprits, which can minimize the use of invasive diagnostic testing and antibiotic usage.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngu, Sam; Pervaiz, Sami; Avula, Akshay; Chalhoub, Michel","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a106dac8c76e89a743b4cdc106df42bcdc16f760.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989006/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.3997","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory compromise","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","serious respiratory disorders","rare case of hRV","ICU","improved detection of hRV","inspired oxygen","immunocompetent hosts","high-flow nasal cannula","High-dose intravenous steroids","dysregulated host immune response","ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen","diffuse bilateral multifocal airspace opacities consistent","subsequent upgrade","ARDS","chest X-ray","adjuvant therapy","nasopharyngeal aspirate","intensive care unit","PCR","use of invasive diagnostic testing","oropharynx","Outpatient radiographic findings","basilar pneumonia","antibiotic usage","year-old female","dry cough","early identification of viral culprits","need","pandemic viruses","human rhinovirus","implication","rapid decline","Polymerase chain reaction","hours","tiotropium","week","Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics","steroid taper","days"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies explored acute and long-term care environments but not outpatient clinics. Objectives of this study were to track microbial movement throughout an outpatient clinic and evaluate the impact of a disinfectant spray intervention targeting high-touch point surfaces. METHODS: At the start of the clinic day, a harmless viral tracer was placed onto 2 fomites: a patient room door handle and front desk pen. Patient care, cleaning, and hand hygiene practices continued as usual. Facility fomites (n = 19), staff hands (n = 4), and patient hands (n = 3-4) were sampled after 2, 3.5, and 6 hours. Tracer concentrations at baseline (before intervention) were evaluated 6 hours after seeding. For the intervention trials, high-touch surfaces were cleaned 4 hours after seeding with an ethanol-based disinfectant and sampled 2 hours after cleaning. RESULTS: At 2, 3.5, and 6 hours after seeding, virus was detected on all surfaces and hands sampled, with examination room door handles and nurses\u2019 station chair arms yielding the highest concentrations. Virus concentrations decreased by 94.1% after the disinfectant spray intervention (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbes spread quickly in an outpatient clinic, reaching maximum contamination levels 2 hours after inoculation, with the highest contamination on examination room door handles and nurses\u2019 station chairs. This study emphasizes the importance of targeted disinfection of high-touch surfaces.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Kelly A.; Sexton, Jonathan D.; Pivo, Trevor; Humphrey, Kyle; Leslie, Rachel A.; Gerba, Charles P.","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4e01e6b414174be99bfb74c5e46bcf18948761a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173130.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318307351; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318307351; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hours","patient hands","high-touch surfaces","disinfectant spray intervention","seeding","high-touch point surfaces","examination room door handles","patient room door handle","Patient care","intervention trials","highest concentrations","Tracer concentrations","staff hands","Virus concentrations","highest contamination","clinic day","outpatient clinics","cleaning","study","Facility fomites","nurses\u2019 station chairs","ethanol-based disinfectant","spread of harmful microbes","nurses\u2019 station chair arms","importance of targeted disinfection of high","long-term care environments","maximum contamination levels","harmless viral tracer","inoculation","hand hygiene practices","understanding","impact","Previous studies","desk pen","microbial movement","transmission","start","baseline","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Objectives","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated whether any major classes of antihypertensive drugs were significantly associated with switching as a proxy measure of medication side effects in a large Chinese population in Hong Kong. METHODS: From a clinical database, all adult patients newly prescribed an antihypertensive mono-therapy in Hong Kong between the years 2001\u20132003 and 2005 were included. Those who paid only one visit, died or stayed in the cohort for \u003C180 days after the prescription, or prescribed more than one antihypertensive agent were excluded. The factors associated with switching at 180 days were evaluated by multivariate regression analyses. Age, gender, payment status, service type, district of residence, drug class, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were predictor variables. RESULTS: From 250,851 subjects, 159,813 patients were eligible. A total of 6,163 (3.9%) switched their medications within 180 days. Patients prescribed thiazide diuretics had the highest switching rate (5.6%), followed by ACEIs (4.5%), CCBs (4.4%) and beta-blockers (3.2%). When compared with ACEIs, patients on thiazide diuretics were significantly more likely to be switchers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.49, 95% C.I. 1.31\u20131.69, p\u003C0.001), whilst patients prescribed CCBs and beta-blockers were similarly likely to have switching. Following these patients up for 5 years showed that thiazide had the most marked increase in switching rate. CONCLUSIONS: The higher rates of switching among thiazide diuretics in this study might raise a probably greater incidence of their adverse effects in this Chinese population, yet other factors might also influence switching rates. Patients prescribed thiazide diuretics for longer term should be observed for their intolerability.","publish_time":"2013-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Martin C. S.; Tam, Wilson W.

Severe KCS with corneal melting and calcium deposits were noted in the left eye.

Lamellar keratectomy and amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) were performed, but acute calcareous degeneration developed with subsequent recurrence of corneal perforation. After regraft, AMT and tarsorrhaphy, the corneal graft remained clear for 3 months. However, breakdown of the corneal epithelium occurred 3 weeks after spontaneous separation of tarsorrhaphy. Six months later, corneal perforation recurred again along with exacerbation of GVHD. Regraft was performed, but the patient refused tarsorrhaphy and AMT. Poor re-epithelialization persisted after regraft. Corneal melting with impending corneal perforation ensued. Further corneal surgery was refused and the patient chose to undergo evisceration.

CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. Author Summary Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krieg, Sarah; Pott, Fabian; Eckei, Laura; Verheirstraeten, Maud; B\u00FCtepage, Mareike; Lippok, Barbara; Goffinet, Christine; L\u00FCscher, Bernhard; Verheugd, Patricia","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00fe67432e35cea2b225647e42f5e919961087d9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/09c9fcabc66a106e01ef42247cbd86b6d85bd67f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.896977","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV replication","virus replication","efficient replication of CHIKV","CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain","replication defective virus","CHIKV patients","CHIKV infection","hydrolase activity of nsP3","protease-deficient virus","inhibited nsP2 protease activity","antiviral activity","Chikungunya virus","hydrolase-deficient virus","de-MARylation activity","nsP2-encoded protease","mono-ARTDs","viral nsP2","dependent MARylation","mono-PARPs","nsP2 protease defective mutant","proteolytic function of nsP2","hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants","protein MARylation","substrates of MARylation","functional replication complex","host-virus conflicts","subset of intracellular mono-ADP","catalytic activity-dependent manner","mechanistic function","polyprotein processing","non-structural polyprotein nsP1","individual nsPs","ARTD12","reduction of processed nsPs","antiviral immunity","auto-proteolytic function","Expression of ARTD10","broad antiviral targets","nsP1-nsP4","non-structural proteins","mechanistic explanation","certain RNA viruses","fast evolving viruses","decrease","pathogens","increased human mobility vector","new strategies","ribosylated interfering","mutations","ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin","Author Summary Infectious diseases","restriction factors","major health threats","climate warming","role","assembly","ribosylation","life quality","need","ribosylhydrolases","modification","economic burden","decline","immune response","acute phase","chronic rheumatism","support","mode of pathogenesis","findings","cells","world-wide epidemics","MARylated","drugs","inhibition","interferons","macrodomains"],"language":"en"},

We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness.

The threat posed by infectious diseases is further deepened by the continued emergence of new, unrecognized, and old infectious disease epidemics of global impact. Over the past three and half decades at least 30 new infectious agents affecting humans have emerged, most of which are zoonotic and their origins have been shown to correlate significantly with socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors. As these factors continue to increase, putting people in increased contact with the disease causing pathogens, there is concern that infectious diseases may continue to present a formidable challenge. Constant awareness and pursuance of effective strategies for controlling infectious diseases and disease emergence thus remain crucial.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes. CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in the lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is amantadine (10uM). Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson\u0027s disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smieszek, Sandra P.; Przychodzen, Bart P; Polymeropoulos, Mihael H.","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1043cb5a53dbd4ba0de1bd1e761c39fc0ed2b7e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361028/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092485792030162X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092485792030162X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin B.

Methods On April 28, 2003, the Infectious Diseases Act was amended in Parliament to strengthen the legal provisions for serving the Home Quarantine Order (HQO). In mounting large-scale quarantine operations, a framework for contact tracing, serving quarantine orders, surveillance, enforcement, health education, transport, and financial support was developed and urgently put in place. Results A total of 7863 contacts of SARS cases were served with an HQO, giving a ratio of 38 contacts per case. Most of those served complied well with quarantine; 26 (0.03%) who broke quarantine were penalized. Conclusion Singapore\u0027s experience underscored the importance of being prepared to respond to challenges with extraordinary measures. With emerging diseases, health authorities need to rethink the value of quarantine to reduce opportunities for spread from potential reservoirs of infection.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ooi, Peng Lim; Lim, Sonny; Chew, Suok Kai","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d818265a6a977c56d49c1336a7dda840aeb5e08f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119078.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655304006030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655304006030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion Singapore"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["quarantine orders","value of quarantine","Home Quarantine Order","large-scale quarantine operations","contacts of SARS cases","HQO","total","spread","health education","health authorities","emerging diseases","empirical methods","Infectious Diseases Act","enforcement","surveillance","contact tracing","framework","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Parliament","transport","legal provisions","opportunities","financial support","Conclusion Singapore\u0027s experience","importance","potential reservoirs of infection","challenges","extraordinary measures","Control","community","place"],"language":"en"},

However, current well-received spatial algorithms assume only one outbreak cluster present at the same point of time which may not be valid during a pandemic when several clusters of geographic areas concurrently occur. Based on a retrospective evaluation on time-series and spatial algorithms, this paper suggests that time series analysis in detection of pandemics is still a desirable process, which may achieve more sensitive performance with better timeliness. METHODS: In this paper, we first prove in theory that two existing spatial models, the likelihood ratio and the Bayesian spatial scan statistics, are not useful if multiple clusters occur at the same point of time in different geographic regions. Then we conduct a comparison between a spatial algorithm, the Bayesian Spatial Scan Statistic (BSS), and a time series algorithm, the wavelet anomaly detector (WAD), on the performance of detecting the increase of the over-the-counter (OTC) medicine sales during 2009 H1N1 pandemic. RESULTS: The experiments demonstrated that the Bayesian spatial algorithm responded to the increase of thermometer sales about 3 days later than the time series algorithm. CONCLUSION: Time-series algorithms demonstrated an advantage for early outbreak detection, especially when multiple clusters occur at the same time in different geographic regions. Given spatial-temporal algorithms for outbreak detection are widely used, this paper suggests that epidemiologists or public health officials would benefit by applying time series algorithms as a complement to spatial algorithms for public health surveillance.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Que, Jialan; Tsui, Fu-Chiang","journal":"Online J Public Health Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14180d7522cd39919afbfe4a6725e1cfc51229bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3615801.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23569624/; https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v4i1.3915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bayesian Spatial Scan Statistic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Time-series algorithms","time series algorithms","Spatial outbreak detection algorithms","spatial-temporal algorithms","Bayesian spatial algorithm","point of time","time series analysis","Bayesian spatial scan statistics","existing spatial models","current well-received spatial algorithms","early outbreak detection","paper","detection of pandemics","multiple clusters","clusters of geographic areas","different geographic regions","outbreak cluster present","public health officials","public health surveillance","increase of thermometer sales","medicine sales","H1N1 pandemic","sensitive performance","likelihood ratio","complement","days","BSS","advantage","wavelet anomaly detector","OTC","WAD","epidemiologists","theory","healthcare data","experiments","BACKGROUND","retrospective evaluation","better timeliness","desirable process","CONCLUSION","disease outbreaks","comparison","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The frequency of HCoV-NL63 infection increased from 1% in 2003\u20132004 to 10% in 2004\u20132005. Sequence analysis of parts of the coronavirus genomes showed considerable similarity to the HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence. The study demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 and hMPV occur in south-west Sweden with essentially the same frequency, seasonal distribution and clinical characteristics as have been reported in other countries.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koetz, A.; Nilsson, P.; Lind\u00E9n, M.; van der Hoek, L.; Ripa, T.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91595c90cb3ae1139a1090369bab9b25abbf6f1d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/67b41dcfefd74d8f2f02b6af2864c4d53231a9b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128111.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14620462; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14620462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63 infections","coronavirus NL63","frequency of HCoV","HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence","frequency of hMPV","Swedish children","young children","RSV","study","coronavirus genomes","south-west Sweden","acute respiratory tract infections","Sequence analysis of parts","respiratory syncytial virus","screening","considerable similarity","human metapneumovirus","county hospital","paediatric department","seasonal distribution","clinical characteristics","nasopharyngeal aspirates","detected viruses","local general practitioners","RT-PCR","patients","samples","countries"],"language":"en"},

Although baculovirus is an enveloped virus that infects insects in nature, it has emerged as a vaccine vector, and we used it to develop a novel candidate vaccine for a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control PCV2 infections. METHODS: Immunoblotting analysis of recombinant baculovirus and immunofluorescent staining of baculovirus-infected cells were followed using anti-ORF2 monoclonal antibodies. The BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with this baculovirus. The titers of antibodies were mensurated with a Cap-protein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a serum neutralization assay. The IFN-\u03B3 response in splenocytes harvested from immunized mice was measured by ELISA. Student\u0027s t-test was used to compare immune responses of different groups. RESULTS: In this study, we successfully constructed a dual-expression-system-based recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2, which can display the PCV2 capsid (Cap) protein and VSV-G protein on the viral envelope and also expressing Cap protein on transduced mammalian cells, thereby functioning as both a subunit and a DNA vaccine. After infection, the Cap protein was expressed and displayed on the viral surface, as demonstrated with an indirect fluorescence assay and immunoblotting. The vaccination of mice with recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 successfully induced robust Cap-protein-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings collectively demonstrate that the recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 is a potential vaccine against PCV2 infections.","publish_time":"2013-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Yu; Cheng, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Jie; Tong, Tiezhu; Lin, Wenyao; Liao, Ming; Fan, Huiying","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/991fb0c5b5cd686d096e2b05d8dc19ca22213df4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4231451.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24161107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cap protein","recombinant baculovirus BV-GD","robust Cap-protein","Immunoblotting analysis of recombinant baculovirus","immunofluorescent staining of baculovirus","PCV2 infections","VSV-G protein","PCV2 capsid","potential vaccine","immunized mice","DNA vaccine","vaccine vector","anti-ORF2 monoclonal antibodies","ELISA","vaccination of mice","c mice","novel candidate vaccine","cellular immune responses","indirect fluorescence assay","serum neutralization assay","specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","infected cells","viral envelope","immune responses of different groups","viral surface","titers of antibodies","transduced mammalian cells","PMWS","progressive weight loss","dyspnea","tachypnea","emerging swine disease","therapeutic strategy","jaundice","anemia","syndrome","splenocytes","post-weaning multisystemic","IFN-\u03B3 response","Porcine circovirus type","enveloped virus","METHODS","dual-expression","diarrhea","insects","nature","BACKGROUND","findings","Student\u0027s t-test","study","piglets","BALB","subunit","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

They originate as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) during the process of MVB formation. Exosomes were shown to contain selectively sorted functional proteins, lipids, and RNAs, mediating cell-to-cell communications and hence playing a role in the physiology of the healthy and diseased organism. Challenges in the field include the identification of mechanisms sustaining packaging of membrane-bound and soluble material to these vesicles and the understanding of the underlying processes directing MVBs for degradation or fusion with the plasma membrane. The investigation into the formation and roles of exosomes in viral infection is in its early years. Although still controversial, exosomes can, in principle, incorporate any functional factor, provided they have an appropriate sorting signal, and thus are prone to viral exploitation. This review initially focuses on the composition and biogenesis of exosomes. It then explores the regulatory mechanisms underlying their biogenesis. Exosomes are part of the endocytic system, which is tightly regulated and able to respond to several stimuli that lead to alterations in the composition of its sub-compartments. We discuss the current knowledge of how these changes affect exosomal release. We then summarize how different viruses exploit specific proteins of endocytic sub-compartments and speculate that it could interfere with exosome function, although no direct link between viral usage of the endocytic system and exosome release has yet been reported. Many recent reports have ascribed functions to exosomes released from cells infected with a variety of animal viruses, including viral spread, host immunity, and manipulation of the microenvironment, which are discussed. Given the ever-growing roles and importance of exosomes in viral infections, understanding what regulates their composition and levels, and defining their functions will ultimately provide additional insights into the virulence and persistence of infections.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alenquer, Marta; Amorim, Maria Jo\u00E3o","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/608a7194b225bedf27e124dfbe8f2acecbca587f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584306.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7092862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26393640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of exosomes","biogenesis of exosomes","importance of exosomes","viral infections","viral spread","viral usage","viral exploitation","composition","endocytic system","MVBs","specific proteins of endocytic sub-compartments","extracellular vesicles","packaging of membrane","functions","intraluminal vesicles","functional proteins","cellular plasma membrane","exosome release","understanding","mediating cell","different viruses","cell communications","ever-growing roles","identification of mechanisms","exosome function","persistence of infections","underlying processes","functional factor","regulatory mechanisms","exosomal release","fusion of multivesicular bodies","variety of animal viruses","process of MVB formation","degradation","direct link","host immunity","lipids","RNAs","physiology","manipulation","changes","additional insights","virulence","ILVs","principle","cells","soluble material","appropriate sorting signal","diseased organism","field","early years","alterations","recent reports","current knowledge","stimuli","Challenges","microenvironment","investigation","levels","review"],"language":"en"},

However, information on the clinical and molecular characteristics of RSV infection in developing countries is limited. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with ARI admitted to the Children\u0027s Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for RSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Demographic and clinical data was also recorded. RSV was found in 23.8% (257/1,082) of samples. RSV A was the dominant subgroup, accounting for 91.4% (235/257), followed by RSV B, 5.1% (13/257), and 9 cases (3.5%) were mixed infection of these subgroups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all group A strains belonged to the GA2 genotype. All group B strains belonged to the recently identified BA genotype, and further clustered into 2 recently described subgenotypes BA9 and BA10. One GA2 genotype strain had a premature stop codon which shortened the G protein length. RSV infection was significantly associated with younger age and higher severity score than those without. Co-infection with other viruses did not affect disease severity. RSV A caused more severe disease than RSV B. The results from this study will not only contribute to the growing database on the molecular diversity of RSV circulating worldwide but may be also useful in clinical management and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2013-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tran, Dinh Nguyen; Pham, Thi Minh Hong; Ha, Manh Tuan; Tran, Thi Thu Loan; Dang, Thi Kim Huyen; Yoshida, Lay-Myint; Okitsu, Shoko; Hayakawa, Satoshi; Mizuguchi, Masashi; Ushijima, Hiroshi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fceffc1872b2d08585dc0a754e5e1a465c0f978f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3551923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349659/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045436","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI","Ho Chi"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["RSV B","molecular diversity of RSV","molecular characteristics of RSV infection","mixed infection","Co-infection","clinical management","developing countries","GA2 genotype strain","clinical data","disease severity","group B strains","BA genotype","Samples","severe disease","major cause of acute respiratory infections","Respiratory syncytial virus","higher severity score","premature stop codon","Children\u0027s Hospital","Ho Chi Minh City","younger age","ARIs","G protein length","Vietnam","vaccine development","high mortality","results","viruses","reverse transcription-PCR","growing database","sequencing","dominant subgroup","information","nasopharyngeal swabs","phylogenetic analysis","subgenotypes BA9","BA10","accounting","subgroups","study","cases"],"language":"en"},

These rapidly elongating cells require tip-focused endomembrane trafficking for the deposition and recycling of proteins, membranes, and cell wall materials. Most of the image-based data published to date are subjective and non-quantified. Quantitative and comparative descriptors of these highly dynamic processes have been a major challenge, but are highly desirable for genetic and chemical genomics approaches to dissect this biological network. To address this problem, we screened for small molecules that perturbed the localization of a marker for the Golgi Ras-like monomeric G-protein RAB2:GFP expressed in transgenic tobacco pollen. Semi-automated high-throughput imaging and image analysis resulted in the identification of novel compounds that altered pollen tube development and endomembrane trafficking. Six compounds that caused mislocalization and varying degrees of altered movement of RAB2:GFP-labeled endomembrane bodies were used to generate a training set of image data from which to quantify vesicle dynamics. The area, velocity, straightness, and intensity of each body were quantified using semi-automated image analysis tools revealing quantitative differences in the phenotype caused by each compound. A score was then given to each compound enabling quantitative comparisons between compounds. Our results demonstrate that image analysis can be used to quantitatively evaluate dynamic subcellular endomembrane phenotypes induced by bioactive chemicals, mutations, or other perturbing agents as part of a strategy to quantitatively dissect the endomembrane network.","publish_time":"2015-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ung, Nolan; Brown, Michelle Q.; Hicks, Glenn R.; Raikhel, Natasha V.","journal":"Mol Plant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2d6d392553754948e32a82843d78c4d4e0dcb7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105205.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205214609114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23118478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1674205214609114; https://doi.org/10.1093/mp/sss092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endomembrane network","endomembrane bodies","image-based data","semi-automated image analysis tools","tip-focused endomembrane trafficking","dynamic subcellular endomembrane phenotypes","training set of image data","GFP","Tip growth of pollen tubes","quantitative differences","quantitative comparisons","pollen tube development","transgenic tobacco pollen","identification of novel compounds","dynamic processes","biological network","Semi-automated high-throughput imaging","varying degrees of altered movement of RAB2","rapid polar growth","monomeric G-protein RAB2","root hairs","membranes","bioactive chemicals","deposition","date","chemical genomics approaches","Golgi Ras","mutations","recycling of proteins","mislocalization","body","elongating cells","straightness","major challenge","comparative descriptors","strategy","cell wall materials","perturbing agents","small molecules","velocity","intensity","marker","vesicle dynamics","problem","area","results","score"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analyses showed that the nucleotides and amino acids were changed at some sites in the M and ORF3 genes of the 15 PEDV strains compared with those genes of CV777 reference strain. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, PEDVs in central China and reference strains could be separated into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 15 PEDV strains belonged to G3 group and showed a close relationship with Korean strains (2007), Thai strains (2007\u20132008), and partial other Chinese strains (2010\u20132011), but differed genetically from European strains (Br1/87) and the vaccine strain (CV777 vs) being used in China. Furthermore, all 15 PEDV strains from central China and some other isolates in China from 2003 to 2007 (LJB-03, QH, and LZC) belonged to different group.

In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population, probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.","publish_time":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yinda, Claude Kwe; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Vanhulle, Emiel; Maes, Piet; Van Ranst, Marc; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68e2c47647afe4bf0237d9f17bb7787738fc8663.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5888411.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29644096/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Epomophorus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat coronavirus","bat bastroviruses","novel viruses","bat rotavirus H strains","bat bastrovirus genome","complete bat rotavirus H genome","Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats","distinct bat phage population","novel group","identified partitiviruses","viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats","putative novel genera","zoonotic events","phage community analyses","hepatitis E viruses","major reservoir of viruses","Phylogenetic analyses","results","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments","separated clusters of human","principal component analyses","cyclovirus strains","human emerging infectious diseases","evidence of additional recombination events","group of virus","recent interspecies transmission events","fecal samples of Eidolon helvum","wildlife","different diets","ample opportunity","alternative mitochondrial genetic code","densoviruses","mitoviruses","respective families","parvovirus","recombinant nature","close proximity","bacterial ecosystems","elements","similar lifestyle","picobirnavirus","plethora","regions of Cameroon","mitochondria of fungi","humans","delicacy"],"language":"en"},

The paper provides a review of antiviral potential of previously mentioned plants which has been demonstrated so far, with special emphasis on anti-HIV properties. Relevant articles were compiled by searching plant names combined with keywords describing antiviral activity. The antiviral effect is direct, with prominent activity against enveloped viral species. Initial stages of the viral life cycle are the most affected, as these plants appear to be targeting mainly viral structures responsible for attachment to target cells. In case of HIV, there is some activity against key enzymes in the viral life cycle. Even in the case of drug resistance, there is an equal susceptibility to applied herbal preparations. Some in vivo experiments suggest that use of Lamiaceae representatives could help in prevention and treatment of some viral diseases. A possible reduction of side effects of diseases and conventional drug therapy are also some aspects worth further investigations.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bekut, Maja; Brki\u0107, Sne\u017Eana; Kladar, Neboj\u0161a; Dragovi\u0107, Gordana; Gavari\u0107, Neda; Bo\u017Ein, Biljana","journal":"Pharmacological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c2a5b7a0468f906b4ace4878e27a05e3d723bdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129285.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661817310253; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661817310253; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2017.12.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","viral diseases","antiviral properties","viral life cycle","antiviral effect","enveloped viral species","viral structures responsible","effects of diseases","prominent activity","review of antiviral potential","case of HIV","anti-HIV properties","case of drug resistance","medicinal effects","herbal preparations","mentioned plants","conventional drug therapy","use of Lamiaceae representatives","important herbal families","self-heal","rosemary","mint","thyme","sage","basil","new drugs","variety of aromatic spices","hyssop","oregano","Abstract Constant search","plant names","prevention","key enzymes","aspects worth","equal susceptibility","special emphasis","attachment","treatment","keywords","Initial stages","lemon balm","cells","experiments","products of natural origin","paper","possible reduction"],"language":"en"},

To trace the evolution of type I and II feline coronavirus in China, 115 samples of ascetic fluid from FIP\u2010suspected cats and 54 fecal samples from clinically healthy cats were collected from veterinary hospitals in China. The presence of FCoV in the samples was detected by RT\u2010PCR targeting the 6b gene. The results revealed that a total of 126 (74.6%, 126/169) samples were positive for FCoV: 75.7% (87/115) of the FIP\u2010suspected samples were positive for FCoV, and 72.2% (39/54) of the clinically healthy samples were positive for FCoV. Of the 126 FCoV\u2010positive samples, 95 partial S genes were successfully sequenced. The partial S gene\u2010based genotyping indicated that type I FCoV and type II FCoV accounted for 95.8% (91/95) and 4.2% (4/95), respectively. The partial S gene\u2010based phylogenetic analyses showed that the 91 type I FCoV strains exhibited genetic diversity; the four type II FCoV strains exhibited a close relationship with type II FCoV strains from Taiwan. Three type I FCoV strains, HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11 and HLJ/HRB/2016/13, formed one potential new clade in the nearly complete genome\u2010based phylogenetic trees. Further analysis revealed that FCoV infection appeared to be significantly correlated with a multi\u2010cat environment (p \u003C 0.01) and with age (p \u003C 0.01). The S gene of the three type I FCoV strains identified in China, BJ/2017/27, BJ/2018/22 and XM/2018/04, exhibited a six nucleotide deletion (C(4035) AGCTC (4040)).

Type I FCoV strains exhibited high prevalence and genetic diversity in both FIP\u2010affected cats and clinically healthy cats, and a multi\u2010cat environment and age (\u003C6 months) were significantly associated with FCoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chunqiu; Liu, Qiujin; Kong, Fanzhi; Guo, Donghua; Zhai, Junjun; Su, Mingjun; Sun, Dongbo","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5e1a2285e027d161fb7098f665b63f382087b17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468573/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["FCoV infection","presence of FCoV","FCoV strains co\u2010","evolution of type","positive samples","healthy samples","China","healthy cats","suspected samples","suspected cats","fecal samples","domestic cats","occurrence of FIP","samples of ascetic fluid","HRB","HLJ","partial S genes","b gene","genetic diversity","multi\u2010cat environment","BJ","age","based genotyping","Feline infectious peritonitis","phylogenetic analyses","feline coronavirus","phylogenetic trees","fatal infectious disease of wild","close relationship","complete genome","high prevalence","potential new clade","PCR","veterinary hospitals","months","Taiwan","nucleotide deletion","AGCTC","evidence","analysis","results","total","data","XM"],"language":"en"},

Several YHV types are known, but only the original type (YHV-type 1 or YHV-1) is highly virulent. Most studies have focused on acute YHV-1 infections and there is limited work on YHV-1 survivors. We compared moribund and surviving (14%) whiteleg shrimp Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei from an experimental challenge with YHV-1. Although grossly normal, all survivors were positive for YHV-1 by specific, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, histological analysis or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating that they were not resistant but tolerant to YHV-1. On the other hand, real-time PCR analysis revealed that mean YHV-1 copies/ng total RNA for survivors (2.8\u00D710(4)\u00B16.9\u00D710(4)) were approximately 40 times lower (P\u003C0.05) than those in moribund shrimp (1.2\u00D710(6)\u00B16.7\u00D710(5) copies/ng total RNA). This was confirmed by strong positive immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization (ISH) reactions for YHV-1 in lymphoid organ tubules (LOT) of moribund shrimp and weak positive reaction only in lymphoid organ spheroids (LOS) of survivors. TEM revealed morphologically complete YHV virions in both groups. Furthermore, immuno-TEM and Western blot analysis revealed that YHV-1 structural proteins gp116 and p20 were present at comparable reactive levels in each group. Thus, YHV-1 tolerance was not associated with absence of gp116 as previously reported for palaemonid shrimp. Instead, it was associated with the presence of YHV-positive LOS and a relatively low viral load.","publish_time":"2007-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anantasomboon, Gun; Poonkhum, Raksawan; Sittidilokratna, Nusara; Flegel, Timothy W.; Withyachumnarnkul, Boonsirm","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a230f011b5de0151a344472a018812008f4f8d0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172694.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X07001346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X07001346","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YHV-type","mean YHV","acute YHV","presence of YHV","YHV types","complete YHV virions","moribund shrimp","survivors","positive LOS","penaeid shrimp","palaemonid shrimp","weak positive reaction","whiteleg shrimp Penaeus","histological analysis","real-time PCR analysis","strong positive immunohistochemical","copies","ng total RNA","immuno-TEM","lymphoid organ spheroids","lymphoid organ tubules","Western blot analysis","RT-PCR","absence of gp116","original type","structural proteins gp116","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","p20","assays","vannamei","situ hybridization","Litopenaeus","transmission electron microscopy","comparable reactive levels","mass mortality","ISH","reactions","invertebrate nidovirus","infections","experimental challenge","limited work","low viral load","Yellow head virus","hand","groups","surviving","times lower","tolerance","studies"],"language":"en"}]}
